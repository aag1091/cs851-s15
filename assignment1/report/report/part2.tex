\label{part2}
Write a Python program that:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Uses ``Carbon Date'' to estimate the age of each links(s) in a tweet
		-See:``http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2013/04/2013-04-19-carbon-dating-web.html''
\item Create a histogram of (Age\textsubscript{tweet} - Age\textsubscript{link})
	    .Many (most?) deltas will be 0,but there should be many>0
\item For these, compute: median, mean, std dev, std err 


\item Use wget to download the text for all the links. Hold on to those,
		 we'll come back to them later.
		 -See :
		 	   ``\url{http://superuser.com/questions/55040/save-a-single-web-page-with-background-images-with-wget}''
		 	   ``\url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6348289/download-a-working-local-copy-of-a-webpage}''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Phantomjs and Casperjs were the required for using Carbon Date library.
\item I created a python scripts to retrieve and save details of links created date by using carbon date library.
\item As it was taking time to retrieve the data using the library. I started running the code on multiple cloud server connected to a single mongodb server.
\item To find an age of a link, I have written a python program `create_data_files.py' which will take the date and return days. 
\item Mean, median, standard deviation and standard error are calculated using statistics python package.
\end{itemize}
