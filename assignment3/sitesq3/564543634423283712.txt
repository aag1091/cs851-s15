Improve your winter run time in 10 secondsEarly morning jogs can leave a bitter taste in the mouth. Fortunately there’s a way to rinse out your routine. Sport scientists at the University of Western Australia found that swilling for 10 seconds with quinine (the stuff that gives tonic water its tartness) can increase your leg strength by up to 4%. It all boils down to biology. Since many bitter substances were poisonous to our paleo ancestors, we have developed hypersensitive receptors in our mouths to warn us about this potential danger, and these put our nervous systems on high alert. A swig before you sweat is all it takes to trigger the response; do it just before you step up to the squat rack or starting block for the full PB-smashing effects. Sounds pretty sweet to us.Daily Upgrade NewsletterSIGN UP TO RECEIVE MEN'S HEALTH NEWSLETTERSWe sift through all the day's new research and studies to provide all – and only – what you need to knowWorkouts and recipes from the best trainers and nutritionists in the worldFitness challenges, culture picks, quizzes and everything else you need to make the most of your downtimeEnter your email address:Please tick if you would prefer not to receive news & special offers from Hearst Magazines UK.
