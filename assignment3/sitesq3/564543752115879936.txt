Councillor joined drunken brawlA Labour councillor caught up in a drunken fight in a restaurant was yesterday given 130 hours' community service.Jahangir Akhtar, 41, was spared a prison term because of his record of helping community relations in Rotherham, where the row broke out between diners last September.Hull crown court was told that Akhtar, a member of the controlling Labour group on Rotherham council, played a leading role in kicking and punching a customer. Judge Simon Lawler described the attack as "a serious incident which led to a number of people being injured and needing hospital treatment".After the hearing, Akhtar said he would continue as a councillor. "I will serve my community no matter what happens. Whether that is in the Labour party largely depends on the reaction today."The court heard that Akhtar, a taxi driver in Rotherham, went to the Minar Balti restaurant in response to a mobile phone call from his brother Tesadiq Hussein, 31, who was drunk and abusive and falsely claimed that he had been attacked by staff.Akhtar, his son Azzizum, 20, and his brother Shabbir, a 36-year-old martial arts instructor, arrived at about 11.30pm. Fighting broke out."Shabbir Akhtar struck a blow to a customer eating his meal and then Jahangir Akhtar joined in the assault on him," said Rodney Jameson, prosecuting. "The man was kicked and punched and fell to the floor and was punched again. He got a black eye."Judge Lawler told Akhtar that he had been given glowing references including an accolade from a former police commander in Rotherham.Hussein was jailed for 14 months for his part in the affray; Azzizum Akhtar was given 80 hours of community service and Shabbir Akhtar 130 hours.
