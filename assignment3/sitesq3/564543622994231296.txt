Making an actual fashion commercial is actually very difficult because it is very focused on direct marketing. What I mean by that is that fashion brands like Dior, tend to market to their established consumer. What I usually consider when I see these commercials is, "why not actually try to attract new consumers and markets?" High end fashion is one of the highest growing businesses IF and only if you have the right group of followers and consumers behind you. Ads in fashion are probably the most ignored because people go off of printed ads or ad campaigns that are in print rather than video advertising. I think Dior still does a really good job directing video advertising but, I am not sure n debating on whether people actually watch these and think of the fashion brand as much as they would looking at a Dior print ad on a high end fashion magazine.
