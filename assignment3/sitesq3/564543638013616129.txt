1) In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients and stir until the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl. For easiest, most effective kneading, let the dough rest for 20 to 30 minutes in the bowl; this gives the flour a chance to absorb some of the liquid, and the bran to soften. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased surface, oil your hands, and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it begins to become smooth and supple. (You may also knead this dough in an electric mixer or food processor, or in a bread machine programmed for "dough" or "manual.") Note: This dough should be soft, yet still firm enough to knead. Adjust its consistency with additional water or flour, if necessary.2) Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or large measuring cup, cover it, and allow the dough to rise till puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. 3) Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and shape it into an 8" log. Place the log in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan, cover the pan loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the bread to rise for about 1 to 2 hours, or till the center has crowned about 1" above the rim of the pan. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350�F.4) Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after 20 minutes to prevent over-browning. The finished loaf will register 190�F on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center. 5) Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool. If desired, rub the crust with a stick of butter; this will yield a soft, flavorful crust. Cool completely before slicing. Store the bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.Yield: 1 loaf.*Use the greater amount in winter or in a dry climate; the lesser amount in summer or a humid climate.Tips from our bakersWhy the range of water in the dough? A lot depends on the weather, the season, and how you measure flour. You'll need the lesser amount of water in the summer; or when it's humid/stormy; if you measure flour by weight; or if you sprinkle your flour into the measuring cup, then level it off. You'll need the greater amount of water in winter; when it's dry out, and the humidity is low; or if you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister, then leveling it off.The liquid sweetener you choose makes a difference. Molasses produces the darkest loaf, one with old-fashioned flavor. Honey yields a lighter, milder loaf. Maple syrup makes a less-sweet loaf — unless you use real maple syrup, in which case it'll be similar to a loaf made with honey, albeit with a faint hint of maple.If you're someone who tends to taste whole wheat as somewhat bitter, try substituting 1/4 cup of orange juice for 1/4 cup of the water in this recipe. A bit of orange juice tones down whole wheat's somewhat tannic taste.Directions1) In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients and stir until the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl.

Preparation and time were really minimal for scratch bread. Mine was complete, from start to finished product in about four hours. I like to hand knead and this was a beautiful bread to work with. I highly recommend this recipe as it is truly a keeper and will be made often in my home. This time around I am adding sprouted red wheat berries for added crunch, flavor and increased nutritional value.04/15/2015Perfetto from Brooklyn, NYI make this bread frequently ; the flavor, color, aroma, and texture of the loaf are consistently excellent. It freezes well also.04/12/2015linda from Jacksonville, arThis is a simple,delicious recipe. I have used king arthur flour and bobs red mill..whole wheat both. The only thing I differently is to knead the bread t h e 2nd time.. it rises nicely and makes wonderful sandwich bread. Of course it's so fearful anyway I eat it!03/13/2015Robin from UtahThis is an excellent bread recipe! I have tried it with each of the three types of sweeteners and prefer honey. I bake mine with just under half white flour just as a personal preference. I have made it about seven times over the past year and have never had a loaf that wasn't delicious. I live in a dry climate and always use all the water. I have stopped looking for the perfect bread recipe because for me this is it!I made this bread today and my bread didn't rise at all in the oven. I baked a brick! I know it's not the yeast because I just got yeast from you in the mail today. :) It did rise during the bulk, and the proofing. Maybe I didn't knead it long enough? Based on the reviews, I missing out! I'm new to baking bread and have never used a recipe with 100% whole wheat flour. It's definitely not the recipe. It's me!Your heavy, dense loaf may be related to the way you are measuring your flour. If you scoop your measuring cup into the bag and pack it into your measuring cup, you can get almost 5 ounces of flour in 1 cup. We recommend stirring the flour using a large spoon or whisk to aerate it and then gently spooning the flour into your measuring cup to ensure a nice, light cup of flour that weighs about 4 1/4 ounces. This will give your bread a structure that will stand up to the expectations of a sandwich bread without being too dense or heavy. You can also try using 50% all purpose flour in this recipe to get a lighter texture. Happy baking! --Kye@KAF03/09/2015Ivy from San Francisco, CAI make this bread weekly and it comes out perfect each time. Is there any way I can double the batch? If so, what would be the oven temperature and how long is the baking?You can double the recipe, but don't double the yeast to keep it under control. If you are just putting it in two pans, keep the oven temp and the baking time exactly the same. Happy baking! Laurie@KAF (/strong>03/07/2015Susan from MinnesotaLook no farther, this is the very best ,whole wheat recipe by far. Everyone loves this bread...Wonderful flavor,moist and good for you.I made mine with honey.Used my KA for kneading about 7 minutes and got a beautiful dough...I have been looking for years for a good wheat bread recipe,now I have it..03/06/2015Ali from FLThis bread tastes really good! It tastes hearty yet it has a way of melting in your mouth. Don't ask me how. You deserve the credit for working some magic in your baking to get some perfect loaves of whole wheat bread instead of baking whole wheat bricks. Kudos to you and your success - it IS possible! Happy Baking - Irene@KAFBest whole wheat bread I've ever made. My husband loved it, which is a first. I left out the sugar/molasses, he doesn't like sweet in his breads, and replaced it (PJ Hamel's suggestion) with 3 T more water. I live in a high altitude very dry place, so I always have to add extra water anyway. I turned out PERFECTLY. Rose well, but wasn't full of holes. Tastes wheaty, flavorful, perfect crumb, slices easily. What's not to love? 5 stars -- actually 10 stars!!!03/03/2015Lea from NYEasy recipe- used white whole wheat flour, honey and 1% milk. Came out great. My adult teenagers LOVED it and they usually don't. Not like my heavy previous whole wheat recipes. I doubled recipe. Today I am trying it and using 1 c. Flax and 1 c. Oatmeal, maple syrup,(double recipe again) I think it will be ok. It mixed light which is rare with whole wheat flour recipes. Being optimistic. Lea, if you are going to add both flax and oatmeal, be forewarned that your bread is likely going to be much heavier and denser than the original recipe. You may want to consider adding 1 tablespoon of our Whole Brain Bread Improver, which is particularly effective with loaves that contain more than 50% whole grains. Good luck experimenting--I hope this loaf comes out just as well as the first one did for you! --Kye@KAF03/03/2015Lea from NYEasy recipe- used white whole wheat flour, honey and 1% milk.
