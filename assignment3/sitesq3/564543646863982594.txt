Search formTaylor Swift Shares Her Grammy PlansBad news for those who were hoping for another live "Blank Space" performance: Taylor Swift has announced that while she'll be attending the Grammys this weekend -- and presenting the award for Best New Artist -- she won't be performing at this year's ceremony."Hey guys! A lot of you have been asking about the Grammys this week and I just wanted to give you an update. I'm really excited to be nominated for 3 Grammys this year and even more excited that I'll be there having a dance party/rage fest in the audience. I will also be presenting the award for Best New Artist. Since my whole life is wrapped up and entangled in the planning of The 1989 World Tour right now, I'm not going to be performing on the Grammys this year. I need this time to focus only on the tour. I hope I'll see you out there at one of the stadiums this summer having a rage fest of your own! Love you. Taylor"
