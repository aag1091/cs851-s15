UPDATE, 2/6: People now reports that Perry will share the stage with Brooke Axtell, a domestic violence survivor and activist. And it looks like the performance will be incredibly powerful: While Perry sings the ballad "By the Grace of God," Axtell will read a written-word piece. "It's an honor to collaborate with Katy in this way," Axtell told the mag. "She has been very devoted to various aspects of female empowerment. It's going to bring a lot of encouragement and freedom to those who hear my story and know that they are not alone in this."
