The aim of the hospice is to meet the physical, emotional, spiritual and social needs of both the patients and their friends and family, and are much appreciated. One person recently said, “We received invaluable support, space and time. Nothing was too much for the staff. There was always someone to talk to, to alleviate fears and instil reassurance.

I think it's an acknowledgement that our approach to working with the community has something good going for it. Something special.Of course we have a strong base in junior football, mainly boys teams but our Football Development Plan has already seen us introduce girls teams and we plan to have more teams for both boys and girls, disabled players and veterans. We also offer coaching for boys and girls. But we go so far beyond that, we have formed dynamic partnerships with local schools and charities, and also have a good working relationship with the Chelsea FC Foundation. We have established various initiatives that focus on areas such as health, education and career prospects but our Community Outreach Team is still looking to expand the programme into other areas.At the heart of our plans is the new community pavilion, which took a step closer to reality last week when the London Borough of Sutton agreed to grant us a long-term agreement for the use of Collingwood Recreation Ground to deliver junior football and so much more. Initially we plan to include a cafe and police facility in the pavilion but hope to expand the services available over time to make a really big difference to the local community. I'd like to emphasise that this really is about our place in the community and the ability of Sutton United, as one of the best known clubs and businesses in the borough, to deliver benefits that align with the goals of the local authority in ways that they perhaps cannot deliver themselves. I think these are really exciting times..Prior to the visit Football Development Plan Executive Officer Dave Farebrother gave SUFCtv this interview:Video of the tour itself and presentation to follow...FA Charter Standard Community ClubFor further information about our work in the community or wish to get involved: Contact CommunityCommunity Funny Day rescheduled, Tim Vine vows to return!27th January 2014Tim Vine vows to returnCommunity Funny DayrescheduledSaturday 15th March.Sutton United vs Basingstoke Town(Kick Off 3pm)Following the postponement of our match against Weston-super-Mare and the loss of the Community Funny Day, we are delighted to announce that Tim Vine has very kindly agreed to return on the 15th March to participate in the rearranged day in support of St Raphael's Hospice.

The club was awarded a £5,000 Grow the Game grant from the Football Foundation, the country’s largest sports charity.The funding will allow the club to prepare its brand new Under-10s girls’ team to participate in the 2013/14 season and to create a second girls’ team by the 2014/15 season. It will also help them to ensure there is a solid coaching system in place, which will introduce young girls to football and provide the basis for future structured training schemes.Bruce Elliott, Chairman of Sutton United, commented: “I am delighted with the grant which will help to expand our girls’ football development programme, and we are most grateful to the Football Foundation for this valuable assistance.”Grow the Game funding increases participation in our national game by helping clubs to provide opportunities for new players, or training volunteers to support new players and teams. The programme is delivered in partnership with all of the 46 County FAs and funded by The FA.So far Grow the Game has awarded 1,267 separate grants worth almost £6m to grassroots football clubs. Analysis of the monitoring and evaluation so far predicts that this will result in the creation of 6,777 brand new football teams competing in FA-affiliated leagues, 91,702 new players participating each week and 15,271 new qualifications or courses being completed.The key strength of Grow the Game is that its participation increases are sustainable rather than transient. Its grants create a solid infrastructure of teams and newly-trained coaches in which new people can start playing the sport, rather than simply providing temporary activity sessions, which are then vulnerable to drops in participation once the programme ends.In Sutton and Cheam alone, The Football Foundation has awarded five Grow the Game grants worth £25,000.Sutton United worked in partnership with the Surrey FA to develop a sustainable development programme and to secure the grant from the Football Foundation. Funded by the Premier League, The FA, and the Government, via Sport England, the Football Foundation is the country’s largest sports charity. Since it was launched in 2000, the Foundation has awarded around 9,600 grants worth more than £412m towards improving grassroots sport, which it has used to attract additional partnership funding of over £565m.Across Surrey, the Football Foundation has awarded 126 grants worth £10,485,681 to projects worth £21,956,172.Paul Burstow, Member of Parliament for Sutton and Cheam, said: “This Grow the Game grant from the Football Foundation is great news for girls’ football in our local community.“Sutton United FC is a real sporting hub for the area, and this funding is enabling them to provide regular football opportunities by allowing them to create a new Under-10s girls’ team.“It is a real privilege to be able to present them with this Football Foundation cheque and I wish them all the best for their debut season.”Paul Thorogood, Chief Executive of the Football Foundation, said: “Grow the Game has become one of the Foundation’s most popular schemes. This additional funding provided by The FA is excellent news for grassroots clubs seeking to start new teams and get their volunteer coaches qualified with FA coaching badges.“This most recent funding window has seen £2.1m invested into 420 clubs right across the country.“Congratulations to Sutton United for working with the Surrey FA to secure their £5,000 Grow the Game grant which will increase participation in the region as well as support girls football development in the area.”For further information about our work in the community or wish to get involved: Contact CommunitySutton MENCAP Christmas newsletter and 'Where are we' Video.21st November 2013Sutton MENCAPChristmas events, newsletter updated webpage with 'Where we are'.Club community partners and good friends Sutton MENCAP have been busy with the introduction of their new sensory room at their Wallington HQ.

Whilst the players were sunning themselves on foreign shores and England flattered to deceive at the Euro’s, Jenny attended no fewer than 10 events over the summer months.School fairs are very much her forte and this year she racked up a record five appearances at All Saints Benhilton, Cheam Park Farm, Westbourne (where she made her radio debut care of Radio Jackie – a definite ‘Sooty’ moment), Tweeddale and Morden Primary.After her run out at in the Domino’s Pizza Mascot Grand National at Huntingdon last year where she came 5th there is no stopping the girl and this year she competed in the Horsham egg and spoon race (going out in a hotly contested semi-final), the Kempton Park Grand National finishing fourth (her dive for the line is must-see ‘you tube’ favourite) and a magnificent second in the 100 metres sprint at the St Helier Festival.Not wishing to miss out on the Queen’s Jubilee Celebrations she also made a guest appearance at the Upland Road Jubilee Party and rounded off her busy schedule last week at the Sutton Green Summer Fair where she met many of her fans including the Mayor and local dancing troupes. Jenny is looking forward to a few weeks well-earned rest before she resumes her ‘day job’ of cheering on Dos and the boys for the coming season. She is also off the club shop to be fitted out in her new kit for next season. A little bird tells me that she has got her eye on the new away kit but if anybody would like to sponsor her for next season or book her for events please e-mail her at functions@suttonunited.net.Many thanks go to Chris Henderson-Smith, Peter James and of course Tony Henderson-Smith for making all this possible.Jenny's looking for a good start before running on to finish a credible 5th in the 2010 Mascot Grand National at Huntingdon.Sutton and Merton Action for Kids who Care (SMAKC) are holding a free Family Fun Day to launch this new innovative project.

This would also provide us with new facilities inside the stadium, including new covered accommodation, toilets, snack bars and a club shop. The parkside terracing touchline would be moved much closer to the touchline and we would like to square off the pitch perimeter fencing at the Collingwood Road end thereby providing better viewing for spectators in a more enclosed, compact, atmospheric stadium. Phase two of the plan would include the erection of covered terracing at this end of the ground and the opportunity to provide additional sports and community facilities behind it. These ground improvements are an intrinsic part of our fully developed Football Development Plan and would provide us with a range of facilities and a stadium of which we could all be very proud, thereby enabling our on-pitch ambitions to be given the very best chance to succeed.We have had some very positive discussions so far with London Borough of Sutton, the county Football Association and various funding bodies and have now reached the stage where we need to submit a definite proposal. Architects have already produced some detailed drawings and we also have cost consultants on board to help us deliver value for money. In order to submit our proposals for funding we need to able to commit to raising some initial capital, around 10% of the estimated costs. Our Supporters’ Trust has already raised around a quarter of this, or 2.5% of the total, so now we need to raise the balance.We are therefore inviting season-ticket holders to make a donation of £250 to the redevelopment fund. In return, we will give a 10% reduction against your annual renewal costs for each of the next ten seasons. If the project does not go ahead for any reason then the money raised will be used for alternative ground improvement works. This scheme is, of course, also open to supporters who are not currently season ticket holders but may be considering it for next season.We know that the general economic situation is not the best it has been, but we hope you will give serious consideration to the scheme as the raising of these initial funds is crucial if we are to successfully implement this ground development initiative.We are pleased to announce our first dedicated Schools day with the attendance of pupils, family and staff of Cheam Park Farm Junior School.Two squads of boys and girls teams will be attending and arriving at 1.30pm to taken on a tour of the ground culminating with photographs on the pitch with Jenny The Giraffe.We are pleased to welcomeHeadmaster Mr Phil Hedger and the Deputy Head Norman Coleman as guests for pre-match lunch.FREE raffle for all pupils attending with the winners announced at Half time.

The Communication Workers Union, who will be handing out free Disability Day T-shirts to event goers. Sutton Eagles FC (the areas only disabled football team) will be present to show off their football skills. MENCAP will also be in attendance along with many other attractions.Disability comes in many forms, some visible and others not, disability can be present from birth or due to an event in later life. The one common aspect is that all disabilities provide challenges be it from a mental health issue or loss of a limb. Sport provides inspiration for many not only to meet those challenges but surpass them. As part of the Football Development Plan Sutton United is committed to the development of opportunity to those with disabilities to participate in sport.For information on the Disability Awareness Day and ways to get involved:At Sutton United we are aware that having a football club as a neighbour is not always convenient and we are grateful for everyone's understanding. However, you also believe that having a successful football club can play an important role in the life of a town or community and, as many of you will know we have a very active Supporters' Trust and Football Development Plan team who are committed to strengthening the links between Sutton United and its local community.We would therefore like to invite residents in our immediate vicinity to attend our home league match on Tuesday 25th October, against Salisbury City in the Blue Square Bet South competition, as our guests.

The ever more popular event attracted a match crowd of 1332, the club's largest league crowd of the season to date.On a warm Autumn day around 750 local school children and parents enjoyed the many attractions which included face painting, the chance to meet their local Metropolitan Police officers.

The presentations were made by club guest of the afternoon Comedian Tim Vine, who can be seen below shaking the hand or paw? of 'Jenny the giraffe' shortly after smashing his penalty past the hapless club mascot.
