Ben Pakulski’s MI40 Review: The Real TRUTHBen Pakulski MI40People, who are not actually familiar with muscle building and want to gain muscles fast and effectively, must learn about Ben Pakulski’s MI40 Muscle Building Program.A recent muscle building DVD workout program introduced by Ben Pakulski claims to trigger massive muscle mass just in 40 days of time. Is not it amazing guys? When asked about the reasons behind the recent discovery, Ben Pakulski said that he basically wanted to dig deep and know if anything a bit different from the common methods can help in muscle building. After a lot of trials and years of experiments, he claimed to come up with a scientifically proved muscle building program. He named it MI-40. According to the new workout program, one person can build muscles using only 20 lbs in place of 80 lbs provided he increases the muscle tension in a very short time.Ben Pakulski gives equal importance to nutrition and increasing muscle tension. The both can help a man increase muscle mass in a short time. But for that, one has to follow the exercise design, diet and nutrition plan prescribed by Ben Pakulski in the new DVD workout program. Ben Pakulski says the longer a person concentrates the tension on the muscles, the faster the growth of the muscles will be. In the special DVD pack, one will find a set of exercise especially designed to help people increase muscle tension.MI40 WORKOUT – WHAT IS IT?Mass Intention 40 or MI40 for short is a 40day resistance training package by IFBB Pro Bodybuilder Ben Pakulski. The program contains training and nutritional manuals and demonstration videos (8 hours) of how to perform each exercise used in the workout. MI40 is an intensive workout program primarily targeted at people with some previous training experience who want to take their physique to professional fitness model, or pro bodybuilder level. This program is a super intense 5 days per week program that is not for the faint hearted or completely untrained individual.Discussing about his Muscle Building Program, Ben maintains that it focuses on preparing the human body to help consume the stored fat as the source of energy. By improving the metabolism, the program forces body to consume the stored fat and thus it gives the body a desirable shape by eliminating unwanted fat. Ben essentially recommends some little-known metabolic foods that promote higher body metabolism enabling people to add muscle mass in relatively less time.Today, many bodybuilders accept that before Ben’s MI40, it wasn’t that easy to gain muscles. “Earlier we used to work out hours everyday only to see an insignificant or negligible muscle growth. But now with Ben’s program, one can quickly double the muscle gain without requiring to take any drug”, reveals a muscle builder and an ardent fan of Coach Ben. Many appreciate Ben’s Muscle Building System, because it is based on the natural workouts and diet programs completely. “Not only quick muscles, it brings long-term health benefits too,” he adds further.Do you know what are the common misunderstandings circulating among people who want to have a washboard abs?MI40 writer, Ben Pakulski, shares a few of them:1. We focused too much on lifting heavier weight. We believe that the more weight we are able to lift, the more muscle it will form. 2. Believing that we all have that one weak body part that no matter how hard we trained it, it just doesn’t even grow very strongly. The fat just keep on clinging to that body part regardless of whatever exercises we assigned to focus on that part. 3. We don’t know whether we have done enough for that day or we’re not doing the exercises hard enough to ensure that we got that coveted muscle growth. We just wished we have done enough without knowing for sure that we did. But you can never tell whether you have done just the right amount of exercises, can’t you? 4. There isn’t any training session which is able to elicit maximum testosterone response, an important hormone to ensure muscle growth. 5. Dieting will give us muscles. But the fact is, regardless of every protein-rich diet we have done, the only thing it manages to do is to add more fat to our belly, the place we’ve been dying to sculpt.What Happens If This Course Doesn’t Work For You?The course offers you the 24/7 customer support service.
