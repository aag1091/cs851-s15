Save ConstantineNBC has not ordered a full season for Constantine despite it's above average initial ratings and increasing quality and fanbase. The show is doing well for it's circumstances: it has one of the worst time slots imaginable, 10 pm on Friday nights.Matt Ryan is perfect as John Constantine, the show is getting better each week, and last episode saw a 38% bump in the ratings and an 87% viewer retention rating (after Grimm) with the introduction of The Spectre.The show still has an option to pick up a second season, so as fans of John Constantine, Justice League Dark, and DC Comics in general we need to come together and make sure Constantine is NOT cancelled.Show your support @ DC TV Universe: www.dctvuinverse.com and www.facebook.com/dctvuniverse
