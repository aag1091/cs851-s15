"Us Now"DaisArtists:At some point in their formative years, 21-year-olds Kennedy Ashlyn and Cash Askew came upon some 4AD and Creation records from the 80s. The watercolor synths and shoegaze guitars from Cocteau Twins, and the menacing march of a Bauhaus snare drum, trickled down to form the backbone of Them Are Us Too. The Bay Area duo's upcoming debut, Remain, is made of a few beautifully simple ideas, each one carefully highlighted.Take the exemplary "Us Now", as Ashlyn twirls up in her soprano range on the words "Just me and you," right before Askew's towering guitars bring in the full-frame climax. It's a Quaalude flashback to such a specific era, but they only hone in on the parts that still shimmer. Maybe they're presenting a kind of greatest hits of 4AD's shades and tones, but it's a perfect starting-point for two retro millennials with an ear for what still sounds good in 2015.
