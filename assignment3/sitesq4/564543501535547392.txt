Betty Crocker Cake Giveaway (now closed)Who doesn’t love cake? I love baking and when Betty Crocker got in touch to see if I’d like to giveaway some of their yummy cake mixes and decoration products I jumped at the chance.In the 1920s Betty Crocker was created to give a personal response to an overwhelming number of letters from women requesting cooking advice. The radio program ‘Cooking School of the Air’ was launched in 1926 and was a daily show where Betty helped women with their cooking and baking dilemmas and Betty’s first Cook Book, ‘101 Delicious Bisquick Creations’ was released in the 1930s alongside the first range of products under the Betty Crocker name. Since then the brand has expanded hugely and offers a large and diverse range of baking goodies with over 90 years of experience going into every item.My personal favourites are the cookies which come in white or milk chocolate chip varieties. Simply add water and pop into the oven for 10-15 minutes for a delicious treat with no fuss!I am giving away a selection of 6 Betty Crocker goodies including cake mixes and icing – perfect for making that special someone a delicious Valentine’s Day treat!
