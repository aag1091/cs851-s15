I love simplicity, punch, power, funk and a twisted angle to a record. I think that's what I bring with this track. I've been testing this for six months now and it just makes me happy playing it"After such huge dancefloor success with 'Helium' and 'Boneless', it's exciting for 'Chest' to come out today, as it is sure to be the next one to heat up every quality DJ's set and be recognized everywhere the party's at.
