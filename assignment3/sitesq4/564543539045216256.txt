Top Meteorologist: Climate Change 'Nothing but a Lie'The co-founder of the Weather Channel is making waves among meteorologists by saying “climate change” is “nothing but a lie.”John Coleman, who co-founded the Weather Channel in 1980, says that the theories of man-made climate change are no longer credible in light of the so-called hiatus in rising temperatures, not to mention that “polar ice is increasing, not melting away.” Coleman adds, “Polar Bears are increasing in number.”“Heat waves have actually diminished, not increased. There is not an uptick in the number or strength of storms (in fact storms are diminishing),” Coleman recently said.“I have studied this topic seriously for years. It has become a political and environment agenda item, but the science is not valid,” he declared.Coleman insists that there is no credible evidence of man-made warming, nor has there ever been. He also says that the theory that carbon dioxide is a pollutant has not been substantiated scientifically.“There has been no warming over 18 years,” Coleman said.Coleman said he bases his conclusions on the very Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that climate change believers say proves their case.A recent article in The New York Postpointed out that last year’s hurricane season was one of the quietest years since 1960, despite global warming advocates insisting that every manner of weather event is supposed to be increasing beyond normal rates.Also, at a recent conference put on by the Heartland Institute, Dr. Roy Spencer noted that despite all the study, scientists really know “almost nothing” about global warming.During his remarks at the conference, Dr. Spencer undermined many of the claims that global warming believers have made. From the misleading temperature records that supposedly show warming, to the untrue claim that climate change will hamper food production and cause mass starvation, Spencer debunked claim after claim.
