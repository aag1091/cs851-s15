Where site owners can offer a professional Daily Fantasy Sports game to their sites visitors. Visitors predict the winners of upcoming sports games and earn points for each correct selection in our pick-em style games. Or in our recently added Player Draft game style, you can draft players from live games and watch yourself climbing the leaderboard in real-time. Users earn points based on individual player performance. The user with the most points at the end when all the fixtures have been played is declared the winner.All the upcoming game schedules, game scores, game updates and player stats are all included in the price of the plugin. The stats are integrated with the plugin. Just the stats alone are worth thousands of dollars per month. This plugin handles all that. It tracks all the picks submitted by the users and updates all the users points, it declares the winners and sends out email notifications. Plus, it also allows the site admin to create their own pools with custom teams, players and fixtures.Front End Features:Lobby Block: This is a list of games that users can enter. Table headings show entry fee of each game and the total payout. It also displays the amount of players that have entered as well as the size of the pool. Of course it shows the time and date when the pool starts. There is also a very use to use search tool where users can narrow down their search for a specific contest to play.Create Contest Page: When a user clicks on Create Contest, they will be presented with a page of options that allow full customization of their league. The site admin has complete control on what options are offered to users. Leagues last just one day.The user can select the sport, date of pool and even the fixtures they want to be part of their pool. They will select if it is a FREE practice game or if the game has an entry fee. They can also select the pool size. It can be a size of 2, which makes it head-to-head or a bigger size to allow for more participants.The game type defines what game to play. This is where you can offer Fan Victor's standard game types or have us build you a custom game type.Pick Selection Page: Once a user creates a contest, they are presented with the Pick Submission page. This is the page where the users enter their picks or draft their team for their contest. Games can be based on a salary cap or non-salary cap for Player Draft games. For custom games, we can create any input page needed for your custom game.Live Rankings Page: Welcome to Fantasy Sports Heaven. After users have entered their picks, they are sent to the Live Rankings page. This page is a summary of their selections. Once the pool has started, users will NO longer be able to edit their picks and will be allowed to view other users picks.
