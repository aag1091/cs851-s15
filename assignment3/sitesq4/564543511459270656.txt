How do Families Best Balance Work and Family?What coping strategies do families use in order to maintain work-family balance?Dual earning family households face difficultly maintaining a work-life-family balance, but as this situation becomes increasingly common what strategies do families employ to deal with the challenges?New research aimed to provide insight into how dual earning families cope:This work constitutes an attempt to tackle these gaps by focusing on the specific strategies that dual-earner families use to manage their work and family responsibilities, and how these work-family strategies associate to work-family conflict and work-family enrichment.The research specifically aimed to consider:(1) how work and family coping strategies associated with work-family conflict and enrichment(2) how couples interact in the enactment of these strategies(3) to establish the role of partner’s coping strategies on work-family conflict and on work-family enrichment.The researchers from the Center for Psychology at University of Porto, Portugal conducted experiments in order to consider these 3 ideas and found some interesting results:In sum, women seem to be better off if they perceive themselves as self-sufficient, they do not need external support and do not count on their partner’s individual skillsInterestingly the authors of the research found that these issues are still contained within gender issues:Our results suggest that, although the attempt to balance work and family is fundamentally a dyadic task, if adjustments are to be made, women are still the ones expected to do them and most of our findings can be understood using a gender role ideology approach.
