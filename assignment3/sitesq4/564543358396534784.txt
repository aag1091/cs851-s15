But just when you thought the 1D fandom couldn't get any more awesome, they've now gone ahead and matched the same amount for charity AGAIN, this time in honour of Monsieur Harry Styles who's turning 21 next week.YOU GUYS ARE SO GREAT. Please treat yourself to some extra chips this evening.Harry's charity drive is currently standing at a whopping £7,824.59 for the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, a vital support line set up to help lend a listening ear for people to discuss their sexuality in an open and non-judgemental way.Seeing as Harreh has proudly shown his support for the LGBQT community on numerous occasions in the past, it's pretty much the perfect choice for his burfdee. We're gonna guess he'd rather have this happening than for us all to buy him a load of novelty socks.Plus, he actually recorded a message for Switchboard to mark their 40th anniversary this time last year. Here he is being fit and friendly.According to the Yorkshire Standard, 1D Fans Give (the brill group behind the 1D birthday fundraisers) have managed to raise a pretty wonderful £35,000 since they began working on the project, and with Zayn and Harry's birthday drives added into the mix, they've apparently surpassed the £50,000 mark.YOU GUYS. You know you're dedicated to a band when you can't afford a chocolate bar at lunch, but you donate to the boys' birthday charity drives. Nice work everybaaahdy.
