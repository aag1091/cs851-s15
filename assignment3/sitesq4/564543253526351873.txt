Awesome video! Great way to educate those who are starting out incubating (and maybe some that have done it for a while), without being a “know it all” You seem very nice, very educated, and the fact that you explain the pros and cons of each product may seem easy enough, but I think it is super informative and give ya mad props on your vid. Thanks!@misschristina11 Its not like of you use 1 cup of vermiculite you should add in 1 cup of water. It means that you need to add the same weight of each one. So something like 50g of vermiculite needs to have 50g of water added to it. Or instead of getting all technical you can simply add water to the vermiculite until you can make a ball out of it, and when squeezed it stays together and releases barely any water. I hope that helps.
