Culture War, NFL: The Victim of Thought PoliceUntil recently, visualization of the NFL was likely to result in a picture of a Tom Brady pass threading the needle or Jimmy Graham showing his goal post dunking prowess following another amazing touchdown reception. After the last few days, however, it is more likely to be an image of two burly football players kissing under the goal post. It is a sad epitaph after all of these years and for many this may be the last straw.We’ve been overwhelmed by the press coverage of the story of Michael Sams, the University of Missouri football player who was finally drafted in the final round by the St. Louis Rams. We don’t hear much about the pending Benghazi hearings into the death of four American citizens by Muslim terrorists, but the media pushes this story down our throat non-stop as if the news is earth shattering.Of course we wish the young man well, but for those of us who are Christians and adhere to the Ten Commandments brought down from Mount Sinai by Moses, the degree to which the NFL demands rigid acceptance of the gay lifestyle under all circumstances is highly troubling. This is particularly the case when we compare the treatment of Mr. Sams with that of Tim Tebow, a devout Christian who took serious verbal abuse while the NFL stood by silently. Frankly, Roger Goodell and his organization should be ashamed of themselves for eliminating tolerance for any view that doesn’t parrot their biased position.So who or what is to blame for this? Well we all are, regardless of our political or moral persuasion. It is just another example of political correctness run amuck and out of control. We have thrown common sense out the window and replaced it with a rigid adherence to whatever the extreme PC crowd deems appropriate through its media push.The Progressives lead the parade of those at fault for they are the ones who not only created this concept but have gone out of their way to force feed it to Americans everywhere, demanding total acceptance from those opposed or as a minimum complete silence. Even we Conservative Christians share in the blame for we have for far too long been silent and allowed the seeds of this plague to gain credence. I mean, really, do you truly savor the reality of watching two men celebrate the selection in the NFL draft of one of them by the public display of a kiss?So the NFL has just bought on to political correctness by hook, line and sinker and in so doing they have created conflict within fandom, within the player community and within team management as well. Many a God fearing parent will think twice about taking children to a game after witnessing that kiss. And since the rules of the game have been watered down with limits on tackling and overly protective rules against the defense and in favor of the quarterback, will we soon relegate the game to flag football with players kissing one another in celebration of a score instead of the outlawed dunk?Let’s face it folks, football is a violent contact sport played by huge men who understand the risks they face and the rewards they can potentially earn. Adding sexuality as an open issue is just more of the dumbing down of the moral fabric of America, a country that is quickly losing its way. And the NFL has just sold its soul because of the active bias of a shameless media and the NFL’s own cowardly management.Remember when the gay community stated that they just wanted tolerance for their beliefs and actions? Well we gave them tolerance and what did we get in return? Just the opposite as they have become Gestapo-like in their efforts to force their views into general public acceptance and, of course, with the support of a President who changed his views for political expediency.Why political expediency? Well, remember, it wasn’t long ago that the President stated that he believed marriage was something to be cherished between a man and a woman, but he morphed into a new view when he realized there were campaign dollars to be gained in big numbers. Oh, the hypocrisy of politicians and big business types when money is their only consideration.NFL football was one of those places where you could throw your cares away and you could sit side by side with others of widely divergent social and political views while rooting for the same time. But now, with political correctness now having infected what was a wonderful game, it has been ruined for many and maybe it’s just time to look for something else for a leisure time activity.Maybe it’s time for Christians and others of a similar moral persuasion to stand up and take a stand like they did for Chic-Filet or Duck Dynasty. Take your money elsewhere instead of to an NFL stadium. You’ll save money and you might just be surprised at the new joys you can find out there.But some of us will miss the chance to see Graham perform his athletic antics, even though they will now come with a politically correct penalty, or Brady throw another perfect pass. When the game loses its excitement, an excitement that used to be shared by people of all persuasions without creating a stir or a fuss, it is no longer fun and that is the case today. How sad that the thought police has driven another American institution into the dust._____________________________________________________________________________________ Thank you for reading Conservative Report!

Team Conservative Report Cancel replyI had been a fan since 1978, but when the NFL fined Don Jones for “inappropriate and unacceptable” tweets describing Sam’s kiss, they lost me. The “F” now stands for “Fascist” as far as I’m concerned. Another American institution has been ruined by the Left and their pervasive, noxious political correctness.
