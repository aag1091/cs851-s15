Mix o'Sun/Clouds but Still WarmClouds rolled in acrossCentral ’Bama this mornin'. Much o'Central ’Bama started thar day wi' sunshine, but clouds mo'ed into ye state from west t'east. Even wi' ye clouds, thar were occasional breaks in those clouds so thar sunshine has managed t'peek through from time t'ime. See thar latest visible satellite image below. Even though thar clouds have blocked some sunshine, temperatures managed t'climb well into t'60s wi' some spots toppin' out at 70 degrees. A cold front be forecast t'move into ye yonder northwest corner o'’Bama around sunrise on Monday an' move briskly through thar state. Thar could be some showers wi' ye cold front, howe'er, at this writin' thar were no showers showin' up on radars across ye Southeast US. Any rainfall that does occur will be small. Temperatures Monday be likely t' headin' in ye wrong direction wi' pretty good cold air ad'ection we may see our high fer t'day shortly after midnight tonight wi' temperatures steady or fallin' durin' yonder late mornin' an' afternoon. -Brian- CommentsCategory: ’Bama’s Weather
