The California BelleMonday, March 9, 2015I wanted to start this post apologizing for not posting as much lately...you guys know how school can get hectic and whatnot. Anyways so I have some downtime before my next class and I was just doing some online shopping in the library and the occasional husband-hunt in the library but then I thought "hmm why not post a blog post?"So as I was looking around I saw so many people disheveled running around all over the place and I was thinking "what in the world is up with these people running around everywhere?!" Then it hit me it was Monday (By the way the Bachelor Finale is on tonight!!!! Comment below if you are #TeamWhitney or #TeamBecca) Why do we always call Monday our worst day of the week? Because we rather have an extra day of the weekend? I am totally for a seven-day weekend, but unfortunately we don't work like that. I personally always think that Wednesday is the worst day of the week because it teases me saying the week isn't over yet.Well I start out wearing something that I absolutely L O V E! If I love what I am wearing I'm more likely to enjoy that day. Then I eat my favorite foods and watch my favorite TV shows (thank you for Monday night Bachelor!). Honestly these simple things make my day so much better and I am so much happier and in a great mood! The people in this library should try it out..So earlier I said husband-hunting is something I do in the library and I think I should clear up what in the world that even is. I just like to look at the few attractive guys that bless this library with their presence and thats about it. I am way too shy to say anything to them, so just even seeing an attractive guy care about his education is good enough for me.So try to have a good Monday everyone!! Go eat your favorite foods, look cute, and maybe find some man candy near you!Wednesday, March 4, 2015One thing I firmly believe is a huge issue in our world today is health awareness. Yes while there are televisions shows such as The Biggest Loser and so many commercials that are designed to motivate the average American, that doesn't change the fact so many Americans are unhealthy. I do not believe unhealthy is only pertained to those that are overweight, as many would assume. Instead I would say being unhealthy applies to anyone of who falls under any of the following:Not having a normal Body Mass Index (BMI)Yes I am aware that some people might have a BMI that is considered obese even though their weight is based on muscle mass, therefore those obviously are excluded.Not eating the food pyramid or correct amount of nutrients needed to satisfy their bodyNot exercising regularlyHaving excess amounts of fatMy Story About HealthI was never really considered a healthy child growing up. I never had a normal BMI, did not eat my food pyramid, did not exercise regularly, and had excess amounts of fat. The time span of my life where I was like this was eight-years-old to about 15-years-old. My BMI was obese and I remember always feeling horrible about the way I looked so my mom decided to send me to a personal trainer to guide me on how to be healthy. I ended up losing weight to being more active in sports and felt great, however once I quit sports I gained a lot more weight than I started out with when going to the personal trainer, which made me feel absolutely horrible about myself. So January 1, 2014 I decided I was going to lose weight and keep it off this time. October 17, 2014 I had lost about 30 pounds and completely transformed my body and self-confidence. I took what I learned from my trainer and applied it with a lot of self-discipline, even though I am not at my dream body, I am a lot healthier and happier.So How Did I do it?Well my secret weapon was my Fitbit Flex, which counted everything from my sleep, food, and activity and so much more (honestly it was one of the best purchases I have EVER made). But I do understand that it can be pricey to some people so here it what I did and I will add alternatives for those who do not want to buy a Fitbit Flex.Make sure they understand and support your healthy lifestyle change because without support it is difficult to do it on your own.Prepare yourself for situations where being unhealthy is a tempting optionI pack myself lunches which consists of mainly fruits and vegetables and a few whole grain carbs. Remember lunch is supposed to be your largest meal of the day so fill it with wholesome nutrients that will keep you full.Remember it takes time to see resultsI didn't start to see results until months after I started to become healthy. It was frustrating but I just kept pushing.Make it a lifestyle and not a choreI incorporated being healthy into my daily routine and turned it into a lifestyle which mean it feel normal to me and I continue my workout routines and health lifestyle even after I lost the weight to maintain my accomplishments.So What Does My Transformation Look Like?Picture on the left: October 17, 2014Picture on the right: December 7, 2013So remember, take care of your body, because you only get one of them.Tuesday, February 17, 2015I believe in equality. I believe that no gender or race is above the next. I believe we are in a time where so much progress has been made, however we are not done yet. Yes, I am a feminist. Before you get annoyed hear me out first.I am NOT the kind of feminist who believes in "free the nipple",I am NOT the kind of feminist that believes in pro choice,And I am certainly NOT the kind of feminist that doesn't believe in traditional values.However I am the following:I AM the kind of feminist that believes women should have equal opportunities in life as a man does,I AM the kind of feminist that will NOT stand for domestic violence and attacks against women,And I certainly AM the kind of feminist that does NOT like modern day feminism.I personally believe modern-day feminism has become a joke, which can make us women ashamed. Feminism was supposed to be empowerment for issues like a woman's right to vote, have equal grounds in the workplace, and to not be treated like a piece of meat. As a minority, women in the past fought so hard to get to where we are today and it is a shame these women are turning this feminist platform into an excuse to whore themselves out to the world.So Why Am I Telling You Guys This?Last semester in my English class, my professor told me I am not a feminist. He told me because I am pro life, do not support "free the nipple", and believe that women should not have beards made me not a feminist. I could not believe my COLLEGE PROFESSOR told me I am not a feminist because I have more traditional values.So Why Am I A Feminist?I am a feminist because I was not viewed equally because of my gender many times throughout my life. I experienced being treated as a lesser individual because of my gender in my own home. I am strong because I got out of that unhealthy environment. I am strong because my mother taught me how to fight like a human. (I do not say "like a girl" because I believe men and women have the capability to be equally strong. it comes from within, therefore I believe like a human fits better.)Monday, February 16, 2015"You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye. And I got that red lip classic thing that you like...cause we never go out of style." Those are some of the lyrics from Taylor Swift's song Style in her album "1989" and not only is the entire album beyond catchy and amazingly produced but I do think its true that we never go out of style. We all have our own personal styles that we love to express so I thought I would share some key favorites from my closet so you guys can get a feel for what my style is. If no one noticed from the peonies all over my blog or my blog name, I absolutely L O V E preppy styled...EVERYTHING!! There is something about preppy style that makes people presentable and approachable, not to mention everything is absolutely fabulous and perfect! I just love a good clean cut look and honestly who could disagree?! Here are just a few must have looks (not in a particular order) for a preppy lifestyle!1) School PrepSchool is when you get to display more of your casual fashion sense. For school I make a note to always keep myself looking presentable (because you never know if you will meet someone important or need to take an important picture). Here is a more casual outfit that I just adore! Everything from the clothes all the way to the tiny accessories make me love this outfit so much!J Crew short sleeve black topAmerican Eagle dark wash jeansNordstrom B.P. statement necklaceTory Burch wrap logo bracelet in peachBCBG multicolor gladiator sandales2) Professional PrepWhenever I think of professional prep I think of Blair Waldorf!! Am I the only one? Seriously her outfits on Gossip Girl were killer! I've always used Blair as fashion inspiration and this next outfit is definitely inspired by Blair! Here is what this outfit consist of:Diane Von Furstenberg tweed dress from Neiman MarcusBlack New York and Company blazerNude Steve Madden heels from MacysSingle strand pearl necklaceJ Crew Factory paved link braceletTwo single strand faux pearl braceletsTory Burch Mini Robinson purse in ivory3) A Preppy Night Out!Here is a fun outfit that I love for a night out with the girls or even for a date night! (but who I am kidding I never get asked out to go on dates LOL) Anyways here is an outfit I paired up together that I believe really gives a bold statement and will be turning heads!Monday, February 9, 2015First off let me start by pointing out the irony in me writing this post when I should be doing some of my homework...but oh well this idea popped into my head so I decided why not write about it? I think after winter vacation one of the worst things for me was trying to figure out how in the world I am supposed to be productive after a nice relaxing vacation! I don't think I'm alone in this situation either. It makes sense that after having a break you realize how you don't want to go back to the daily routine of work, school, responsibilities, etc. I've tried many ways to be more productive for this semester like I was in the previous and I guess it is always up to personal preference but here it was I found works for me:1) Keep a plannerI absolutely L O V E having a planner where I can write all my tasks I need to get done for the day and what time frame I can schedule my work in. I guess you can say it keeps me more on point and aware of the time.2) Reward yourselfBeing on a tight schedule can be very difficult to maintain and requires a lot of self-discipline. Which is why I believe in rewarding yourself for doing such a good job on staying on schedule! (obviously by me writing this blog post I am not going to be rewarding myself anytime soon lol) But anyways you should reward yourself in what makes you happy whether it ranges from shopping, food, hobbies such as crafting, or spending time with loved ones. I personally reward myself with either or these choices except I try to make the food healthy because rewarding yourself with unhealthy food is a bad habit I don't ever recommend.3) Make a to-do list that is separate from your plannerOur planners are designed to keep our days productive, but to-do lists are designed to keep ourselves motivated to reach goals in life. Having goals are very important because without a goal then what is the purpose of life? To keep a to-do list is your mini goal list for the day/week/month/year that keeps your eye on the prize (accomplishing the goal).4) Surround yourself with positive and productive peopleThis is probably the most important step in being productive because if the people around you are not having similar productivity goals that you are then it is really discouraging to continue your own. If your friends are generally productive it doesn't mean you have to throw them away, but maybe you should get them involved as well! The more productivity we have flowing throughout society the better! Remember no one ever said "oh you are too productive it is bad and needs to stop".Anyways here are just some tips I thought I would share with you guys and even though they are very basic it doesn't change how important they are. January is always known as the "New Years resolution month" where we all pretend to be productive for the entire year but it typically starts to die out in February. Just because it can die out for some people doesn't mean you have to be one of them! Be different and make a change, even if it wasn't part of your New Years resolution to be more productive it doesn't mean you can't start now! If I motivated at least one person today then I know that this blog post was indeed productive, but in order for me to know if I was successful in my attempt comment down below and let me know! Do you guys already use these techniques? Do they work for you? Any suggestions for other readers what else they can do? I would love to hear all your thoughts!Sunday, February 8, 2015Ladies! (and sometimes gentleman) Have you ever been asked this question before and gotten annoyed? Well don't worry you are not the only ones who get beyond annoyed with this question. In the past 36 hours I have been asked by several different guys as to what I look like. I guess maybe I am looking too much into this but it does get annoying after a while. I mean these anon accounts are A N O N Y M O U S and we aren't really supposed to know what each other looks like but we picslip for fun because well..why not? But when people message you to talk to you and quickly ask what you look like it can get annoying.I believe this is a way that guys let you know their intentions and that they are "fuckboys". I mean seriously guys do you think us girls don't know the game you are playing? Not only do we know what you are doing to us, but we know that you talk to a million other girls and say the same exact things to them as if you have a template already typed out.Now don't get me wrong, I believe girls are just as capable of being "fuckgirls" just like a guy can be a "fuckboy". Gender should not be a reason to categorize all of a certain gender as a "one type" because that is simply not true. I have met some genuinely amazing people through the anon world on twitter (you all know who you are), but it doesn't change the fact that people are still constantly asking us what we all look like. I mean does it really matter to people out there what we look like? Does my physical appearance change the level of our basic conversation anyways?**Sidenote** Before I go on to discuss about physical appearance I want to clarify that everyone has what they are attracted to (myself included) but I do not believe conversation should be limited to based only on physical appearance. Anyways as I was saying, mine or anyone else's physical appearance should not dictate the level on conversation with have with one another. I know a lot of people will probably disagree with what I have to say by stating that "anon twitter is practically a dating site where we all flirt with each other so obviously looks will be involved" and yes that is partially true I am not denying it. I guess the point I am trying to make is that I don't think it is ok for people to only message you to make small talk and then find out what you look like. What happened to wanting to get to know people for who they are and not solely on lustful attraction?Sorry for my rant everyone but I really wanted to get this off my chest because I'm bothered by people only wanting to know what I look like (even though it is mainly fueled by human curiosity, which I understand). I guess you could say it is the Sagittarius in me that is fueling the fire to write this post. I know I am going to get hate from people on this and that is ok because everyone has their own opinion, just like this is mine.XOXO,The Californian Belle**Disclosure** If you are reading this and feel like you fall under this category or you are offended in any way shape or form because this is not your intentions just know this is a generalization post and probably doesn't pertain to you directly. IF you happen to be one of the guys that have asked me what I look like just know this is only a freaking blog post. I'm mainly writing this blog post because it seemed like something many people can relate to so don't get too offended (oh and thank you for giving me material to write on).Saturday, February 7, 2015Hello everyone! My name is California Belle and I am a new anon on Twitter (@BelleCalifornia) and new to blogging! I thought a lot about what my first blog post would be and decided its best that I start with introducing myself (kinda best if you know about the person who is writing this blog, right?). Anyone else find it difficult to describe yourself when meeting someone new? Well thats me right now trying to figure out how in the world I will start all of this off!One thing that I always ask people when we first meet (if they aren't weirded out by me) is what their Zodiac sign is. Growing up my mom was very big on the Zodiac signs and animals that coincided with the Chinese calendar. I've always believed that people's behavior reflect their signs and years they were born (I guess it has something to do with how I was raised). I am a Sagittarius (for those of you that don't know the Sagittarius is a fire sign, which explains my crazy personality that you will see in my later blogs) and I was born in the year of the pig. I absoluetly L O V E my Zodiac combination I think my parents planned out when having my perfectly. Those who are born in the year of the pig tend to be honest and quick tempered (which is why I think it fits that I am a Sagittarius as well). Fun Fact: Ronald Reagan was also born in the pigs year so there is some hints about what my political affliation is.Wow so much on a freaking Zodiac signs I guess you can see how much I like to look into those. Anyways here are some quick things about me so you get to know more about me. I love Gossip Girl, J Crew, the color pink, preppy outfits, the tusk in sun Lilly Pulitzer print, my pitbull, and my friends and family of course! (how could I leave them out and put them last? Well they know how much I love and appreciate them!!). I am vegetarian, Russian Jewish, Republican, as well as a health and fitness "freak". I can't stand liars, cheaters, rude people, and fast food places. OH and I ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have my nails painted!There are more things about me that you will read over time but here are the basics for now. I am really curious to know more about my readers! Comment below what your Zodiac sign is, the animal of the year you were born in the Chinese calendar, and one thing you can't go a day without.About MeHello my name is California Belle! I like to think of myself as a West Coast Belle that is ladylike with a set of traditional values I live by. Follow my blog so we can go on this journey called life together!!
