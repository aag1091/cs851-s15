What's New in Version 1.0.19ScreenshotsCustomer ReviewsGreat Gameby ProdigyX2010Addictive, free and exactly the same as the machines in the pub. Definitely recommended if you enjoy the slot machines you see in pubs and don't want to pay or win any real cash. Also it gives you the chance to understand the machines before you go and play for real cash in the pubs :)Please fix DracPotby Jaks09The new game DracPot that was added in the recent update is broken, it doesn't save you game and makes you restart each time you play it, the new game also freezes a lot. Apart from that it is fun to play and doesn't always kill you on a question mark.Please fixSlow, lack of creditby FjfhdvhthjhtgVery jumpy and glitchy, 500 credits every 4 hours goes within 1 minute on 25p play, isn't enough to stay interested and always get kicked off the board after 3 or more 'extra cash' or 'add features', the '?' Mystery is also very predictable and the HI LO spinner is fixed so you can barely ever win it even once without it killing you off
