About SunnyWell I am 24 and I am from Cleveland Ohio and enjoy making people smile. Growing up as the oldest of 5 I did not really have much. But I didn't really care as long as my siblings had what they needed. I've always been the one to joke around and make people laugh because I hate to see people down. I love to make someone's day better and Instagram has allowed me to do that. Even when I am feeling down if I can reach out to somebody else and make their day it makes me feel better. I know there are a lot of funny people in the world but I do it because I really care. I want to help people in so many ways and even if it's just putting a smile on their face I'm ok with that. I don't want anything given to me I want to earn it. I don't want handouts I want to be put in a position to get it on my own. Even if I don't become a finalist it won't discourage me. It will only make me strive to get up to the point where everybody will know who Cornell is and until that day comes I will work for it âœŠOur Esteemed PartnersAbout the Shorty AwardsThe Shorty Awards honor the best people and organizations on social media, culminating in a blockbuster ceremony in New York City.
