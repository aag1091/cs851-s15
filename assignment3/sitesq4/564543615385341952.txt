Engineer slams 'dodgy model' for tunnelClay Lucas -Aug 31, 2013Former VicRoads manager of network modelling for the east-west link project Doug Harley above a scetion of the Eastern Freeway he worked on as an engineer. Photo: Simon O'DwyerFor 27 years, Doug Harley built the state's roads. Starting at VicRoads in 1986 as a 22-year-old, he worked as an engineer on many big bypasses and freeways, including the extension of the Eastern Freeway from Doncaster to Springvale in the 1990s.Last month, Mr Harley quit the road authority, disgusted at its role in plans to extend the Eastern Freeway again, this time at its other end for the east-west link.This freeway would see a six-lane tunnel built from the Eastern Freeway in Clifton Hill to CityLink in Flemington. The project, which Premier Denis Napthine wants started by late next year, will cut travel times between the two freeways to seven minutes and allow motorists to avoid up to 23 sets of traffic lights.But Mr Harley, who rose to become VicRoads' manager of network modelling and analysis, said the proof used to justify the road as the state's most urgently needed transport project wasn't good enough. ''I'm not opposed to any project as long as it's assessed properly and taxpayers don't get ripped off,'' he said.The east-west link, he said, had been assessed ''using a dodgy model to produce a benefit-cost ratio'' that made it look a huge economic success.Mr Harley was named in a media report this month about leaked VicRoads emails, in which he wrote that a proper and transparent case had not been made for the east-west project.Contacted by Fairfax Media at the time, he declined to speak. Mr Harley said he decided to talk publicly after Dr Napthine, responding to that report, said VicRoads had verified the project's traffic estimates.''Nobody in VicRoads with any traffic modelling expertise signed off on it. Their own manager of network modelling and analysis - me - was saying, 'No, you cannot trust this'.''Mr Harley, who took a redundancy package from the road authority in July, said he had been ''drummed out'' after demanding the road be adequately justified.But VicRoads strategy and planning director David Shelton said the traffic estimates used in the project had been extensively reviewed, internally and by a peer review process. He said the government was pressing ahead.He said of Mr Harley's objections, ''differing views and opinions are often expressed in any large organisation''.Resistance to the east-west project is strong in the neighbourhoods affected by it, with crowds expected at protests on Saturday afternoon outside Fitzroy Pool organised by local councillors and residents.But for the project's many supporters - particularly in Victoria's business, property and transport sectors - linking the Eastern and CityLink freeways is crucial, the need self-evident.The Australian Industry Group represents many manufacturers, and its Victorian director Tim Piper said the project was critical for the state, and should be started swiftly, because it would help so many businesses.''There is a huge amount of industry in the east [that needs it], anywhere from Dandenong to Moorabbin, not just manufacturing,'' he said. And he said the ''inertia'' caused by the city's congested roads meant the east-west tunnel was needed.Mr Piper pointed to conjecture when CityLink was first proposed that it wasn't needed: ''Today there would be no argument it was an essential part of our infrastructure.''
