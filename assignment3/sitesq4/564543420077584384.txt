Hello everyone. Sorry that we haven't announced much recently, we've had our heads down getting on with development, which is coming along nicely! We've also been having fun playing the game...Just wanted to let you know that we've applied to Steam to be able to release the game on Early Access, at a lower price point until full release.Whilst there's still a lot of development planned for the coming months (in particular, polished graphics etc), the game is in a really good place with a load of cars, and three genre environments (Rock, Urban, Dance), ghost challenges with Steam friends, and is really good fun (we've found some brilliant tracks along the way).We want to be able to get your feedback as we go, to help us develop the game to be the best it can be! So Early Access seems a great way to do that. We'll keep you updated, if it gets approved we'll have an Early Access release date for you soon!!We'll also be coming to you in the next week or so with some gameplay videos of full tracks. Exciting times!Inspired by some of our favourite games like Wipeout, Trackmania, Vib-Ribbon and Audiosurf…Drive Any Track is a high octane music based racing game where we create racetracks from the songs in your music library.Action on track is synced to the audio, you literally have to race the music to stay in time and score points.You've seen other music powered games, DAT takes the concept to the next level with our innovative MEGA engine. Drive Any Track takes any song, analyses it down to its core components and creates a unique racing experience from it.Verses, choruses and drops become checkpoints, and the environment and cars are styled to the genre of music you're playing.Experiment with your music collection and find out which songs make the best racetracks!Be the first to 'create' a race-track from a song and have your name forever enshrined on the track’s leaderboard.Drive Any Track is currently in continuous development, with three genre styles already included (Dance, Rock, Urban), and a selection of unique cars and liveries (and some secret cars you have to work out how to unlock!)Further development will continue as we add more musicality, genre styles, cars, stunts and gameplay elements.
