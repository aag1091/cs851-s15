ACCELERATED EXPLOSIVENESSFive visible, hexagonally-shaped Nike Zoom Air bags in the outsole of the LEBRON 12 enhance natural motion while providing accelerated explosiveness with each step. Nike Zoom Air delivers the same great cushioning it brought to footwear when first introduced to basketball in 1995; now the hexagonal Nike Zoom Air is mapped to the pressure points of the foot where it’s most needed for basketball performance.In tandem with the sole, the lightweight and breathable Megafuse upper is designed to act as a molded second skin that minimizes weight and amplifies breathability and comfort.SUPERIOR SUPPORTJames runs approximately three miles per game, and the average player changes directions about 1,000 times over that distance, requiring supportive, comfortable footwear to withstand tremendous impact and torque. Dynamic Flywire cables provide lockdown support for James’s unrivaled combination of speed and strength. The upper is constructed for a precise fit, with Hyperposite wings that deliver targeted support and protection.Prototype/Look See Sample/Elite SampleNIKE ID Available 10/06"NSRL"Turquoise/Grey-Crimson-Black 684593-301 11/28/14LEBRON 12 NSRL – James wasn’t made in a lab, but he is made better by Nike’s research, testing and analysis.

Inspired by James’s legendary work ethic and physical gifts combined with Nike’s finest performance technology.Whoa...I'm intrigued by the off-the-wall approach at least...BUT...have a feeling these will push the envelope a little too much for the price they'll ask for & I'll be waiting on the sidelines. We'll see.Before these leaked, I figured the XIIs would have a modest price increase, maybe $210, since there was a major jump in price from the Xs to the XIs. After seeing that leak, I can see these going to $225.So these will build on the XI Elite out sole pattern with a zoom bag in the heel. I wonder if they are going back with the lunar insert, or if the setup is going to build off the Soldier VII as to why he is playing so much in them..
