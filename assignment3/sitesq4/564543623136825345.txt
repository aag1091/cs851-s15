Post navigationClarke Carlisle – The Uninsurable Event – JSwipeAfter QPR vs Southampton yesterday, I ran into Clarke Carlisle at White City tube station on my way home from the game. For American followers, Clarke was a professional soccer player and is a highly articulate intelligent man that attempted suicide 6 weeks ago by throwing himself under a truck.He suffers from clinical depression and fortunately his attempt failed. We had a brief chat and I told him how moved I had been by his story and what a fabulous football commentator I thought he was, let’s wish him well in his recovery.It just struck me that last week I met a £108m Euro lottery winner and this week I met someone who attempted to commit suicide by trying to throw themselves under a truck. It was a stark contrast. Depression is something of which we all need to be more aware as it can strike in some extraordinarily unexpected places. The one currency that can never be devalued by a central bank is self esteem.The Uninsurable EventWhen Stephen Catlin (the head of one of the world’s biggest underwriters) says cyber security presents the “biggest, most systemic risk he has come across in his 42-year career in insurance,” it should be of great interest.The thing that fascinates me about Stephen’s statement in the FT is that you would never drive your car without insurance, yet leaving your life savings in a bank with minimal Government deposit protection is just fine.In addition, thousands of pension funds have no hesitation in owning billions of dollars of bank and reinsurance shares that could be put out of business in a few seconds if a cyber attack were to be successful.He goes on to say that Insurers are worried about their exposure in this area because cyber risks are hard to model and unusually systemic (as opposed to hurricanes and acts of god which are of course really easy to model!)Mr Catlin then calls for Governments to step in to cover risks associated with cyber terrorism – although I am not quite sure why.There were no insurance contracts in place in 2008 when the systemic risk caused by subprime lending crippled the financial system, yet almost every government stepped in globally to salvage the wreckage of the banking sector in return for equity or egregious loans.Maybe one of my insurance chums would be kind enough to explain what incentive there is for governments to act in advance of a cyber catastrophe, especially considering that the terms of engagement will always be more beneficial to a government post the event when there is real distress.Also, after having sold Catlin to XL for around 5 billion dollars, it occurred to me that Stephen is starting to take more of an interest about bank deposits and their security.Technology Update – JSwipeI have been meaning to write about JSwipe for a while after I found out a couple of the younger members of my team were utilising the app described as Jewish Tinder.Interestingly the guys in my office that possess the app are not Jewish. They said they joined as a hedge in case their careers didn’t work out. The reason they are able to join the site is that JSwipe have developed a “willing to convert” button in your profile setting.Have a quick read of the review below, it’s quite funny and I apologise in advance if any of my friends find that their daughters are members.Finally, I think it is time to admit my timing was wrong about the stock market. There are only two types of investors in the current climate: those that believe there will be a day of reckoning and those that do not.I believe that having broken almost every economic law in history that at some stage we are going to pay a very heavy price but correct timing is everything and admitting you are wrong is as important as integrity is our most important currency.For the time being cheap oil has put real money in people’s pockets and I never foresaw a 50% correction in energy prices – being wrong is a part of life.About Nick FinegoldNick Finegold entered the financial services industry in 1987 as an institutional research analyst for Wood McKenzie and Co.
