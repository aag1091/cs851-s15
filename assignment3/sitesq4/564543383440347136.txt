You Will Never Hear A Better Comment About ISIS After What Lt. Col. Ralph Peters Just SaidLt. Col. Ralph Peters joined Lt. Col. Allen West on Fox News’ Hannity to discuss how ISIS – also known as Daesh – is not desperate after the burning of the Jordanian pilot, as the Defense Department claims, but instead loves to torture and is empowered by it.“They’re having the time of their lives. This kind of violence is captivating, exhilarating and thrilling to these guys. It’s never going to get better for them than this,” Peters said. “They have power now. They can exert their will over others.”He concluded by calling out Obama on his polar extreme war choices of either “airpower alone” or “hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the ground” as “absolute bull” because there is likely a middle ground where there’s a “limited amount of boots on the ground for a limited time.”
