16 Social Media Tools The Experts Swear ByKeeping up on the freshest social media tools and software is a pretty difficult challenge for the average social marketer.New tools are being released all the time. Old ones are retired or acquired or lose that one key feature you really needed them for. And testing every new option is not realistic.To help you weed through the options out there for measuring, publishing and monitoring, we reached out to past Social Fresh Conference (our social media conference) speakers.The answers covered a wide set of solutions that every social marketer should know about. From some of the oldest tools, Radian6 and Tweetdeck, to some of the most popular, Buffer and Simply Measured, to several tools that you probably do not know about.Check out full list below. If we missed your favorite social media tool or software, be sure to let us know in the comments.Matthew Knell, @MatthewKnell We’re big fans of Buffer because of its simplicity and it’s ability to plug into a bunch of other content aggregation / curation tools (Feedly, Pocket, Mention) to make content easier to find. Their addition of Feeds is a huge one for sites like ours with lots of content, and their Business has pretty great Google Analytics integration.Kristy Bolsinger, @kristySimply Measured. Hands down. They just keep creating valuable assets in their reporting suite. Easy to use measurement and engagement tracking, and now with GA integration you can gain a pretty holistic POV on your digital efforts.Jason Keath, @jasonkeath RSS to Twitter publishing options. Incredibly simply and great for blogs that just want to make sure each posts goes out to their network simply. Lots of bonus features. Replaces some key abilities that we use to depend on Argyle Social for before they shut down in May of 2014.Thanks Social Fresh team and our good friend @ChuckHemann for adding Sysomos to this list of other great tools!Cheers, Sheldon, community manager for Sysomoshttp://www.dayngrzone.com/ DayngrLove that Radian6 is there!Jon HartNot sure why you’ve included LinkedIn as a tool but thanks for a good article. One of my favourite tools is Pyne for iOS. It allows users to a quick poll response on any subject. You can get around 50 responses from random users, plus comments, within 24 hours, which is perfect for sanity checking your ideas.http://socialthreesixty.com/ Chad EgelandSome amazing tools on the list, many new ones I am eager to try out now.http://mysocialgameplan.com/about Jonathan PayneBuffer all the way…KerrySound like some good tools to investigateBen Olive-JonesGreat list, nice seeing ol’ faithful Hootsuite listed.

It’s so easy to make sure all blogposts get shared on the right platforms – fully automated – and that my Instagram photos are actually visible in the Twitter timeline. That, and the fact that I get a weekly list of the people who started following me in my e-mail, makes IFTTT a very important social media tool. Please add it to your list if you agree :-)http://www.phyrra.net/ PhyrraI love Crowdbooster.
