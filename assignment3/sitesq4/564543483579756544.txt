Vaccine provides extra protection, but people should not depend on vaccines," said Ko.In public hospitals, the overall occupany rate for medical inpatient bed yesterday has reached 103 per cent at all public hospitals, with 10 of the 16 major hospitals having reached over 100 per cent, according to Hospital Authority’s data released on Sunday morning.Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei has the highest occupancy rate of 118, followed by Tseug Kwok O Hospital with 114 per cent and United Christian Hospital in Kwun Tong with 113 per cent.United Christian also saw the highest number of visits at its emergency and accident unit.“Since the winter peak this year appear to be longer, the demand has pose pressure to us,” said the authority’s Chief Executive Leung Pak-ying.He said the public hospital will try to appeal private doctors to take up part-time duties at the public hospitals to cope with the demand.He said he hope more private clinics would be open during the Chinese New Year holiday to take care some of the patients.
