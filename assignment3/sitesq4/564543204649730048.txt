#6 âItâs over!âSeriously? Donât be one of those girls who decide to break up with a guy via text message. Have some courtesy and class to do it in person or at the very least over the phone. This kind of news deserves to be told in a more appropriate manner. Plus, breaking up with someone over text can come off as, for lack of a better word, bitchy. And at the very least, if you do decide to break up with someone via text, DO NOT make it a two worded text saying âitâs over.â
