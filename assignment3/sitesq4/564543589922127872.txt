This surprisingly massive courthouse sits in a surprisingly small town square! It hardly seems like you are in a town at all when you come upon it. The city has a population of about 400 (est 2000). This is the east face of the Montague County Courthouse in Montague TX. The address of the courthouse in simply Route 57, Montague. This is the 4th courthouse for the county, built in 1912 after the third courthouse was damaged severely by a storm. The others date from 1858, 1879 and 1885. It is build in the Classical Revival style in brick, steel and concrete. It has a raised basement, and staircases at all four entrances, as well as porticos, pilasters, and dentils. Although the east face is not the main facade, I liked this view because the early morning sun brightened the building so well in the face of an oncoming storm from the west behind the building.FEATURED PHOTO, Tweaked and Antiqued group, 7/11/14FEATURED PHOTO, Historical Buildings of the World group, 7/3/14UploadedJune 17th, 2014StatisticsViewed 1,428 Times - Last Visitor from Beverly Hills, CA on 04/29/2015 at 1:13 AM
