A Granby man who worked in Springfield College's information technology department has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges and to using his position to illegally access students' computers and email accounts to steal private photographs.Prosecutors said Tuesday in Hampshire Superior Court that the 39-year-old David Linnehan had nearly one million child pornography images on computers, hard drives and other electronic devices he owned.The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports that Linnehan pleaded guilty to more than 30 charges, including multiple counts of distributing child pornography, possessing child pornography, and of gaining unauthorized access to a computer.Authorities say Linnehan is also responsible for the creation of child pornography by encouraging a California woman to send him nude pictures of her young daughter.
