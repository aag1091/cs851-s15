Based in Texas, Leading 'Anti Vax' Group Fights BackAs the measles outbreak puts so called 'Anti-Vaxxers,' or families who decline to vaccinate their kids against common childhood diseases, on the defensive, it is a Texas group which is defending their decision to be suspicious of inoculations, News Radio 1200 WOAI reports.Dawn Richardson is a director of the Austin based 'Parents Requesting Open Vaccine Education' or PROVE, and she says while pharmaceutical companies and doctors stress the safety of vaccinations, their own literature says otherwise."On every single package insert presented by the pharmaceutical companies on vaccines, there is a disclaimer that vaccines have not been tested for their carcinogenic potential," she told News Radio 1200 WOAI.The group fights back against the use of terms like 'anti vaxxer' to attempt to discredit parents who have a healthy skepticism about vaccines, and helps parents who want to apply for the 'parental waiver' which allows families to avoid the 'no shots no school' rule requiring all students to be vaccinated before they can enter public school."The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, put forward by Congress to protect vaccine manufacturers from liability, has paid out nearly $3 billion in damages to families who have members who have been injured or killed by vaccinations," Richardson said.Doctors nearly unanimously agree that the advances made by vaccination over the past fifty years far outweighs the small chance of a vaccine or its components contributing to illness or death. They point out that a 1998 British study that linked common childhood vaccines to autism has been completely debunked and its author has lost his license to practice medicine.The Texas Education Agency says the number of parents who have filled out the form to claim a moral objection to vaccinations under the 'no shots no school' law has doubled in the past decade.The anti-vaccination movement in Texas got a big boost in 2007, when former Gov. Rick Perry attempted to mandate all middle schoolers to receive HPV vaccine. Several groups objected, from those who felt the HPV vaccine was dangerous, to religious groups who said mandating the vaccine was simply giving youngers a 'free pass' to engage in dangerous sexual activity, and the proposal was withdrawn.
