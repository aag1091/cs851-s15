Choose A Channel:This Tiny House Seems Weird From The Outside, But When You Step Inside? WHOA!I’ve seen some truly remarkable pieces of architecture while writing for LittleThings — especially tiny houses. Followers of the Tiny House Movement will be quick to tell you that a small space doesn’t mean a lack of options and possibilities. In fact, some tiny houses can be more impressive than huge mansions. I’ve seen tiny houses in the shape of crosses, boulders, piles of logs, and even Hobbit holes.Recently, I saw photos of a gorgeous tiny house built in a triangle shape so it fits on a peculiarly shaped lot.This Japanese house designed by the brilliant architects at Mizuishi Architects Atelier fits a family of three in a 594-square-foot home on an abnormally shaped property.According to a study reported by the Guardian, quirky homes like these are more common in Japan because homeowners and architects can afford to build homes that may fade out of style. Homes are built more for style than longevity because of the frequency of earthquakes. Building codes get updated nearly every ten years and, as it stands right now, it is actually cheaper for many families to rebuild than to restructure. Most homes in Japan depreciate in value rapidly, and to make their home investments worth it, Japanese homeowners will destroy their house and build a brand new one to gain profit. This calls for a huge demand for more modern and innovative homes.This planned obsolescence has made resulted in an increased demand for Japanese architects. There are 2.5 architects per 1,000 residents in Japan, while the United States has only .33 architects per every 1,000 residents.The architects at Mizuishi Architects Atelier have done an incredible job making a deceptively amazing tiny house!Please SHARE if you think living simply is better than living extravagantly.
