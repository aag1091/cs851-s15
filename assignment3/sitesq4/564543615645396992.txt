Law and Order Mini-Series Could Be in the Works at NBCLaw & Order was on the air for 20 seasons, but fans still can’t get enough of the crime procedural. Now, NBC may finally give the fans what they want and may be looking to revive the series, according to Deadline.In a move similar to the forthcoming revamped Heroes mini-series, Heroes Reborn, the network is rumored to be considering a 10-episode Law & Order mini-series that would reunite some of the cast members with the show that made Dick Wolf a household name and the show’s infamous “bum bum” scene bumper sound effect a household joke.While beloved grumpy detective Lenny Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) is no longer able to deliver pithy one-liners, Chris Noth who can now be seen on The Good Wife, and Sam Waterston , who played long-suffering District Attorney Jack McCoy, have reportedly been approached about reprising their roles.Other members of the vast Law & Order diaspora that could also be called upon to return to active duty include Benjamin Bratt, who was recently seen on 24, Jesse L. Martin who is currently on The Flash, Angie Harmon, who has switched teams and now plays a cop on Rizzoli & Isles, and assuming Lt. Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson) won her fight against breast cancer, it would be great to have her back wearing a badge on the show.The show’s return could be a big win for NBC. Thanks to re-runs on multiple channels, the show has continued to build a fan base. A new mini-series could give those fans some resolution after Law & Order, which last aired in primetime in 2010, was abruptly cancelled.Plus, if Law & Order does return to NBC it would be a great way to mark the show’s 25th anniversary, which comes in September, and would give the network a shot at besting Gunsmoke as the longest-running scripted TV series (Law & Order was cancelled just one season short of breaking the record).While negotiations may be under way for Law & Order: Original Recipe to return to TV, its spinoff Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was renewed for its 17th season this week.
