Unbelievable. Senator Rand Paul just launched an ugly attack on Social Security and on Americans living with disabilities.In an attempt to build support among extreme right-wing Republicans in advance of a likely presidential run, Senator Rand Paul told a group of New Hampshire Republicans on Wednesday that a majority of people who receive Social Security disability benefits are “gaming the system.”1We need to hold Senator Paul accountable for this factually untrue and patently offensive attack on Americans living with disabilities and our Social Security system.Sign the petition: Condemn Rand Paul’s attack on disabled Americans and Social Security.Rand Paul’s attack on Social Security and disabled Americans wasn’t only heartless and offensive, it was also untrue. According to a report released in November by the Social Security Administration’s Inspector General, fraudulent Social Security Disability Insurance claims are exceedingly rare – accounting for just 0.02% of all payments.2 As as Social Security Works Executive Director Alex Lawson noted recently, “America has one of the strictest disability standards in the developed world.”3This isn’t the first time Senator Paul has attacked Americans living with disabilities. In a 2010 interview, Paul said he supports abolishing the Americans with Disabilities Act – the landmark 1990 legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability – because it isn’t fair to business owners.4Senator Paul’s latest attack on Social Security and those who receive benefits is the latest salvo in a decades-long attempt by radical Republicans to defund, destroy or privatize our Social Security system. We’re not going to let them get away with it.
