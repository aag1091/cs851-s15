British Nigerian Afrobeats Duo Loco and Eazzy return with their latest track entitled ‘Jeka Jo’ accompanied by amazing visuals, directed and produced by UK’s very own Alexx Adjei of PPV. Shot in the heart of central London, Jeka Jo tells a story of two fast paced gentlemen who outwit as well as outsmart one of Londons’ biggest gambling gurus’. The pair illustrate how lively and vibrant London is with their club scenes truly showing what it means to ‘Jeka Jo’ (Just dance). However, their night is short lived when they realize they are about to make contact once again with the guru.
