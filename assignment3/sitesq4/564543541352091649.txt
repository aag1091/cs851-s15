The Egyptian interior ministry released a statement, per The Guardian, claiming fans used force in an attempt to gain access to the stadium."They tried to break the stadium gates by force, which forced security to stop them from continuing to do this," the ministry said.STR/Associated PressThe Ultras disagree, saying the police used tear gas as the fans tried to get into the stadium, per Kennedy.The incident is reminiscent of the Port Said riots of 2012, when fans stormed the pitch in the aftermath of a match between Al-Ahly and Al-Masry, resulting in at least 74 casualties, via The Guardian's Abdel-Rahman Hussein.
