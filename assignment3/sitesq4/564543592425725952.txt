Like "trying" to be a combo of popular female artist. But really doesn't fit them. Its like a 90's throwback. I feel like if they're meant for more acoustic a more natural sound vs trying to be fake.Reflecting on this Album This album is really great, combining electronic sounding tunes with an early 2000s vibes. I am thoroughly impressed with the girls and their development since they left X-Factor after almost winning. It's rare to see a group, especially a girl group, reaching their potential and being so cohesive. Personally, I prefer the acoustic version of We Know, but that is the only thing I would personally change.I Love 5th Harmonyâ™¡â™¥â™¡â™¥â™¥ I love 5th Harmony so much they are so very talented. They are also so very pretty, every single one of them. I dont just like one person more I love them together. They are just so funny and its like this was faith for them to be put together. Like there song says BETTER TOGETHER. there amazing its just scary but good scary. When I first saw fifth harmony I thougtht they were all pretty and I like their song miss movin I used to jam to it all the time then didnt. But this past month ive been watching their interviews and how they were even put in a band then I fell in love with them like their music and their personality. Like they knew each other for 2 years or a little longer and they seem like they knew each other longer than just 2 years. They really love each other . It looks like to me that they knew each other their whole life. Their so funny and BETTER TOGETHER. So thank you so much fifth harmony for having such a big space in my heart and being a inspiration to me. I wish I can meet you one day. (who knows) my hands are startin to hurt but I love you so much. But you guys are worth itâ™¥â™¥â™¥ cant wait to your album im going to pre-order it.. YEAAAAAAA!!!!!â™¥â™¥ bye.!Yea, um no.

Reminiscent of the girl groups of the new millennium these girls mix nostalgic sounds with modern style. Inundated with pop culture references, harmonies, and female empowerment this album showcases just who Fifth Harmony is. From slowed down tracks like We Know to upbeat hitters such as Worth It or Top Down, this album will appeal to every pop and r'n'b lover.FIFTH HRMARMONY R THE BEST I love fifth harmony so of course I wiil love their music as well and I do.
