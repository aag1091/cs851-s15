We arrived at the museum today early enough to check that all was ready to receive the first visitors at the Trondheim venue of “Descending North”.The welcoming was informal, but informative, warm, and cordial.People were magnetized by the images that Yannis has put together, and those who had also descended north in their lives talked with him about their own experiences of being Greeks in Norway.Gradually, the visitors started moving towards the table with the publications by Yannis and with the comments’ book. With the exhibition at a cross point of the museum’s building, it is sure that Yannis will have hundreds of comments to read by the time his photographs will be packed in May to go to their next destination.A last round of talks with those closest to Yannis at the set-up of the venue at Trondheim……and we had some time left to visit another exhibition that NTNU-Vitenskapsmuseet was hosting these days.But more on the other exhibits at NTNU in retrospect when I am back to Bergen tomorrow.
