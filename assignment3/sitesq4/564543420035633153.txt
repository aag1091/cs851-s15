Multi Site SEO ServicesMulti Site SEO ServicesThere’s a ton of difference in the methods we use between our General , Multi Site SEO and Local SEO, but there’s actually an extremely simple way to know which package needs to be ordered. If the website is for a local business that has a listing on Google+ Local (formerly Google Places), then you’ll want to order Local SEO. If it’s just a normal website like a web-based store, a musician, blog, forum, etc. then you’ll want to order our General or Multi Site SEO.PackageKeywordsPrice30 day TrialNo TrialLevel 15 websites 50 Keywords$697.00 / MonthLevel 210 websites 100 Keywords$1597.00 / MonthLevel 315 websites 150 Keywords$2497.00 / MonthLevel 420 websites 200 Keywords$3397.00 / MonthLevel 525 websites 250 Keywords$4297.00 / MonthLevel 630 websites 300 Keywords$5197.00 / MonthLevel 735 websites 350 Keywords$6097.00 / MonthLevel 840 websites 400 Keywords$6997.00 / MonthLevel 945 websites 450 Keywords$7897.00 / MonthLevel 1050 websites 500 Keywords$8797.00 / MonthThe free trial charges a refundable $0.01 fee when signing up if you choose the “Start Trial” button.
