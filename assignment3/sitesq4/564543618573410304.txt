…sharing my recipe box & a little everyday lifeThis Whipped Lemon-Vanilla Bean Butter is super fluffy, easy to spread, and simple to make. It’s also delicious enough to be eaten with a spoon. I’m not even kidding.Kudos to every fine dining establishment that offers warm, fresh popovers and little cups of softly whipped butter before the main entrée arrives. This delicious sentiment is truly a gift for me, mostly because I rarely take the time to make these items myself. Which really is quite silly, as both of them are incredibly simple to make.

It’s creamy and luscious and utterly unforgettable.Everyone should have FIESTA dinnerware in their home. Here’s your chance to win eight 4-piece place settings!
