N Srinivasan may return to BCCI as soon as MarchN Srinivasan is confident about contesting the BCCI elections scheduled in Chennai on March 2. It is understood that there will not be an alternate candidate installed in Srinivasan’s stead to get around the conflict of interest issue.Srinivasan’s eligibility depends on a couple of factors – selling off his stakes in Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and then getting a favourable court verdict to an affidavit, seeking permission to contest.“He (Srinivasan) never left power. It’s just that he had stepped aside for a while as per the court order,” said a source close to Srinivasan. “The court verdict will be taken into account and everything will be in accordance with the order.”On Sunday, Srinivasan chaired the BCCI working committee meeting in Chennai and in consultation with his colleagues decided that the cricket board’s 85th Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in his backyard on March 2. This is when the announcement is expected to be made.Sellling stakeAccording to sources, Srinivasan informed board members that he’s in the process of selling off his stakes in CSK, following which he would be filing an affidavit before the court, seeking permission to contest as a presidential candidate. He has been given a go-ahead by the BCCI legal team in this regard. Srinivasan’s company India Cements, that holds a major stake in the IPL franchise, has called a board meeting on Wednesday to take a decision on the split.During the meeting, members decided to file a review petition before the apex court, challenging the order that has made the cricket board open to judicial scrutiny under Article 226.While delivering the order in the IPL corruption case, the two-judge bench of the Supreme Court said the BCCI was performing public function and any violation made it open to litigation under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
