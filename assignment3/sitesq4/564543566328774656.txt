What's New in Version 2.2ScreenshotsCustomer ReviewsNeeds Some Work.....but is funby Sexy NJUpdate: originally I thought this game was so much fun until I got further up. Suggestions: as you answer more questions, win more coins. Questions 1-10 are 5 coins, 11-20 are 10 coins, etc. To only win 5 coins per answer but it costs 60+ for any hints is very lopsided. Also, if the game gives you a letter, the game should remember what it gave you. I got stuck and received 3 letters. I couldn't watch any more videos so I quit and came back. When I came back, on the same question, I watched some videos and when I had enough coins to get another letter it gave me a letter it previously gave me. Basically I wasted 60 coins.The game is fun but you could definitely make it more fun!Good game but...by Cheer4life13This is a good game it challenges you to think about the restaurants. But at least give us 20 helpers at the beginning. Because when I started I had no helpers and had to use my coins. But overall it's a good game.Fun but...by Crystle is cuteIt's a good game if you're into guessing games or games like these but I have one thing that should really be included,when you get the name of the restaurant right we should be rewarded more than 5 coins each and the cheat/help buttons should be less coins
