Put your 99 cent ebook in front of readers on 20 ebook sites AND in diverse social media outlets!Amazon Kindle 99 cent promotions are being called “the new free,” so it’s no wonder authors are clamoring for ways to advertise their 99 cent books. Some sites charge up to $20 per day to feature a 99 cent book! So unless you sell a lot of books, you would be lucky to even recoup your investment. And that’s just the fee for one site.We knew there had to be a more effective way to advertise 99 cent ebooks. So we did some research and put together a package that spreads the word about your 99 cent book far and wide for three days. There’s also optional coverage if you want to promote a 99 cent sale for seven days or as it goes all the way through a 7-day Kindle Countdown promotion and changes prices.You get the best of all worlds for $45: submissions to sites that will feature your book, home page placement on our site, posting to Facebook groups that are dedicated to promoting 99 cent Kindle ebook sales and plenty of diverse social media coverage.The total value of the package when bought separately would be $90, but you pay only $45. You save 50%!You can also buy additional days of tweeting for only $10 more per day. You can use these extra days if your 99 cent sale runs for more than three days. This extra coverage also is handy if you’re doing a Kindle Countdown deal. We will continue to tweet about your book after the price goes up from 99 cents; we will just remove the 99 cent announcement in the tweets.
