A three-point field goal (also known as a three-pointer, three, tri, or shot from downtown) is a field goal in a basketball game made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc surrounding the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made within the three-point line. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the 3-point line is 22 ft. (approximately 6.706 m) away from the basket in the corners of the court. This distance naturally increases along a 14 ft. (approx. 4.267 m) straight line that is 3 ft. (approx. 0.914 m) away from the sidelines. At the 14 ft. mark, the 3-point line becomes an arc 23 ft. 9 in. (approx. 7.239 m) away from the basket and remains so until the arc reaches the straight line on the other side of the court 14 ft. from the baseline. In international FIBA & WNBA play, the three-point line is 22 ft. 1.75 in. (6.75 m) away from the basket on the arc and 21 ft. 8 in (6.6 m) at its corners. In both men's and women's National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) basketball, the three-point line is an arc 20 ft. 9 in. (approx. 6.325 m) away from the basket that, unlike professional leagues, does not change as it gets closer to the sidelines.ContentsThe three-point rule was first tested at the collegiate level in a 1945 NCAA game between Columbia and Fordham but it would not be adopted on a permanent basis until much later. At the direction of Abe Saperstein, the American Basketball League did so in 1961, becoming the first basketball league to adopt the rule. Its three-point lines were each a radius of 25 feet (7.62 meters) from the baskets, except along the sides.[1] The Eastern Professional Basketball League followed in its 1963–64 season.The three-point shot later became popularized by the American Basketball Association after its introduction in the 1967–68 season. Then commissioner of the ABA George Mikan stated the three-pointer "would give the smaller player a chance to score and open up the defense to make the game more enjoyable for the fans."[2] During the 1970s, the ABA used the three-point shot, along with the slam dunk, as a marketing tool to compete with the National Basketball Association (NBA).In the 1979–80 season, the NBA adopted the three-point shot despite the view of many that it was a gimmick.[3]Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day.The sport's international governing body, FIBA, introduced the three-point line in 1984, at a distance of 6.25 m (20.5 ft).The NCAA's Southern Conference became the first collegiate conference to use the three-point rule, adopting a 22-foot (6.7 m) line in 1986. The first collegiate team to score a three-pointer was Western Carolina University. Over the following five years, NCAA conferences differed in their use of the rule and distance required for a three-pointer.[4] In 2007, the NCAA lengthened the men's three point distance to 20 feet 9 inches, with the rule coming into effect at the beginning of the 2008–09 season. American high schools, along with elementary and middle schools, adopted a 19 ft. 9 in. line nationally in 1987, a year after the NCAA.[5]During the 1994–95, 1995–96, and 1996-97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the distance of the line from 23 feet, 9 inches (22 feet at the corners) to a uniform 22 feet (6.7 m) around the basket. From the 1997–98 season on, the NBA reverted the line to its original distance of 23 feet, 9 inches (22 feet at the corners). Ray Allen set an NBA record with 269 made three-pointers in the 2005–06 season. Stephen Curry then broke Allen's record during the 2012-13 season with 272 three-pointers, and again during the 2014-2015 season with 286 three-pointers.In 2008, FIBA announced that the distance would be increased by 50 cm (19.69 in) to 6.75 m (22 ft 1.75 in), with the change being phased in beginning in October 2010. In December 2012, the WNBA announced that they would be using FIBA's distance, too, as of the 2013 season.The three-point line generally consists of an arc at a set radius measured from the point on the floor directly below the center of the basket, and two parallel lines equidistant from each sideline extending from the nearest end line to the point at which they intersect the arc. A player's feet must be completely behind the three-point line at the time of the shot or jump in order to make a three-point attempt; if the player's feet are on or in front of the line, it is a two point attempt. A player is allowed to jump from outside the line and land inside the line to make a three-point attempt, as long as the ball is released in mid-air.An official raises his/her arm with three fingers extended to signal the shot attempt. If the attempt is successful, he/she raises his/her other arm with all fingers fully extended in manner similar to a football official signifying successful field goal to indicate the three-point goal. The official must recognize it for it to count as three points. Instant replay has sometimes been used, depending on league rules. The NBA[6] and the NCAA specifically allow replay for this purpose. In NBA games, video replay does not have to occur immediately following a shot; play can continue and the officials can adjust the scoring later in the game, after reviewing the video. However, in late game situations, play may be paused pending a review.If a shooter is fouled while attempting a three-pointer and subsequently misses the shot, the shooter is awarded three free-throw attempts. If a player completes a three-pointer while being fouled, the player is awarded one free-throw for a possible 4-point play. Conceivably, if a player completed a three-pointer while being fouled, and that foul was ruled as either a Flagrant 1 or Flagrant 2 foul, the player would be awarded two free-throws for a possible 5-point play.Major League Lacrosse features a two-point line which forms a 15 yard arc around the front of the goal. Shots taken from behind this line count for two points, as opposed to the standard one point.In gridiron football, a field goal is always worth three points. NFL Europe (defunct) and the Stars Football League have adopted a rule similar to basketball's three-point line in which an additional point is awarded for longer field goals; in both leagues any field goal of fifty yards or more in either league is worth four points.The Super Goal is a similar concept in Australian rules football, in which a fifty-metre arc determines the value of a goal; within the arc, it is the usual 6 points, but 9 points are scored for a "super goal" scored from outside the arc. To date the super goal is only used in pre-season games and not in the season proper.[12]
