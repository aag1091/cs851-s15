Just head here !!I was amazed at the quantity to begin with, it was a gala feast. In the set lunch you can choose one of the 4 meat options and 1 out of the 2 dal options. Rest is prefixed which is rice, roti, salad and raita with chutney. I had ordered Lal Maas and Dal Makhni.The taste was excellent, was very flavourful and good on the stomach. Packing qualityof our reviewers recommend us was good and all of us enjoyed our individual meals. The desert was gulab jamun which was also part of the set lunch and it had dry fruits at its core.of our reviewers recommend us is something different that you donâ€™t find in every restaurant, it is really amazing to see the car and other such stuff at a restaurant. The ambiance is nice. A great place to enjoy quality time with family over a peaceful dinner,
