Feature: McConaghy Yachts Unveil Tri60 Trimaran YachtIt remains a concept for now but the guys at McConaghy Yachts are not shy about their latest development. They recently unveiled the design for a Day Boat concept utilizing the trimaran platform. You do not have to cast your mind too far back to remember the 42-meter trimaran "Adastra" that they built to much public fanfare. BMT Asia Pacific has worked with McConaghy Yachts on this one again, not a strange collaboration as they have done work together before. The Tri60 will pretty much be a day boat available in two versions, at least in concept. They are expecting to have a Tri60 'Saloon' and a Tri60 'Cabriolet'. The Saloon version is pretty self-explanatory with the platform just focusing more on the interior and featuring a full-beam master suite. The Cabriolet on the other hand will bring out the true purpose for the Tri60 model... which is as a day boat for relaxation, focusing on the outdoors and connection to that exterior.The Tri60 features a very spacious beam akin to that found onboard vessels of 27-meters LOA. Of course the huge windows in conjunction with the skylights and sliding glass doors allow a wealth of natural light to infuse the interior. Imagine, even on a yacht this size, there is still space to store a 3.0-meter four-person tender. Aside from the stability that the 'outriggers' provide, they also allow for additional storage for deck furniture, fenders and water toys. Performance wise, the Tri60 is looking at a 32-knot top speed with a pair of 475-horse power engines connected to twin waterjets.Mark Evans, Joint Managing Director at McConaghy notes: “In taking the Tri60® forward we are building on decades of high-performance composite and multi-hull experience in prototype and production boats that will deliver a unique yacht, providing clients space, style and speed in a manner that no other yacht of this size offers.”
