What she means: how did the girls from that show h2o possibly live their lives? They were three teen girls living in Australia and any time they so much as touched one drop of water they transformed into mermaids. How did they go to the bathroom? Did they never wash their hands afterward or did they suffer through being mermaids while at any point trying to take care of their personal hygiene? What if they had to pee at school? Imagine the germs. Does sweat also trigger their transformations? They live in Australia it's impossible that they could avoid sweating for their whole lives. Honestly the idea of turning into a mermaid seems awesome but changing every time they touch water is so ridiculously impractical like I know some of these scenarios are addressed in the show and at times even large plot points but I feel like the writers of the show chose to ignore some situations merely for the convenience of the show and I think about that oftenIt kind of upsets me that the most popular preservation day posts only have around 500 notes. I know there arenâ€™t that many Jews on Tumblr, but please, goyim, reblog preservation day posts. Go in the tag and find them if you have to. It just means a lot for the small population of under represented Jews. Thanks.
