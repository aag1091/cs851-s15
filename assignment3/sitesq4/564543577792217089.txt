Sunday, February 8, 2015The Four Horsemen - NWA and WCWYou know I had forgotten just how many people had been in the Four Horsemen and how many incarnations there were.The original group was Ric Flair, Arn and Ole Anderson and Tully Blanchard with James J. Dillon as their manager way back in 1986. They broke Dusty Rhodes' ankle and hand, broke Ricky Morton's nose, injured Nikita Koloff's neck and held most of the titles in the NWA at one time or another.Over the years, the group changed with only Ric Flair and Arn Anderson being the two constants. Lex Luger, Barry Windham, Sting, Sid Vicious, Paul Roma, Brian Pillman, Chris Benoit, Steve "Mongo" McMichael, Curt Hennig, Jeff Jarrett (maybe) and Dean Malenko were all members at one time or another. Arn said that Jarrett never was "really" a Horseman.
