Psychology and EczemaUsing stories to help children with eczemaWe have created four stories for children with eczema designed to be adapted by parents or health professionals so that the 'hero' of the story is the child reading the story. Two stories are targeted at improving treatment adherence, and two introduce ideas to help break the itch-scratch cycle.To use, simply download the desired story in Microsoft Word, then change the details. Details only need to be added on the second page – the rest of the text will update automatically to create a fully personalized story.To change these details, click on one of the fields (e.g. [Name]) and type the information required. To change between fields click the ‘tab’ button on the keyboard or use the mouse.There is promising evidence that providing children with such personalized stories can improve engagement, treatment adherence, reduce stigma and facilitate effective adult-child communication.
