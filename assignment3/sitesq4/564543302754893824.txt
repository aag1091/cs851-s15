So, I got a bench press and some other equipment the other day, and decided it would be a good time to start keeping a journal that keeps track of my weights and PR's over time. I am also going to keep track of the supplements I am on, my body weight and write down my workouts and weight that I use, as well as when I am sick or resting. I think this will help my keep track of progress and help me see if something impacts me by keeping a few notes. What are your guys' experiences with this? Is this just a waste of time? I apologize for this being an unorganized flow of thought if that makes sense.Its a very good idea..you will be able to track progress which will keep you motivated, see what you did right or wrong if you made extra gains or none etc, and you can use them to do self experiments which can be very beneficial. make sure you have lots of notebooks though.
