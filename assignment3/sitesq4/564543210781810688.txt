The Tea Party News NetworkRetired famous pediatric neurosurgeon and author Dr. Ben Carson, a possible 2016 presidential candidate who just released his latest book, “You Have a Brain,” appeared on Fox & Friends Saturday to comment on Obama’s attack against Christianity in an attempt to deflect attention away from the face that virtually all terrorism in the world is committed by Muslims, comments Obama made at the National Prayer Breakfast in which Obama compared Christians to ISIS terrorists.Dr. Carson said is was “disingenuous” for Obama to “try to divert the attention away from outrage that has been focused on the radical Islamic terrorists.”“Obviously, it makes me feel that perhaps we’re being betrayed,” Dr. Carson, a Christian, told host Tucker Carlson. “Perhaps we don’t have a leader who feels the same about things as most of us do.”
