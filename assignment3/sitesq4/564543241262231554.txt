No love lost as Marischal Square protest continues on Valentine's DayBy Neil Drysdale on Friday 6 February 2015ShareThe protests against the controversial Marischal Square project in Aberdeen are set to escalate in the coming weeks.STV has learned that a demonstration has been arranged for the city centre on Saturday, February 14, while campaigners against the £107m development intend to write to the Scottish Government asking for them to call in the plans for the Aberdeen site.They are also planning to contact the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner over what they claim have been deliberately misleading statements by certain councillors.Lorna McHattie, one of the leading advocates against the current Marischal Square plans, told STV on Friday that the protesters had invited three senior Aberdeen City Council members to the meeting.These are the council leader Jenny Laing, finance convener Willie Young and planning development convener Ramsay Milne.As of Friday afternoon, none of the trio had responded to the invitation.However, a recent poll carried out by the Evening Express showed exactly the opposite.We’ve updated our app to give you an even better experience.
