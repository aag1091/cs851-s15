UConn Students Hospitalized With IllnessesReceive the latest local updates in your inboxThree UConn students were hospitalized due to illnesses sweeping the campus."UConn has received several reports over the last few days of students with nausea, vomiting, weakness or other symptoms consistent with viruses, gastrointestinal illnesses, and/or the flu," UConn media spokesperson Stephanie Reitz told NBC Connecticut in an email. "It’s the height of a particularly tough flu and virus season, so unfortunately, this is not a surprise. These illnesses also can spread easily in areas where many people live in close quarters, such as among roommates and friends in residence halls."UConn brought three students to Windham Hospital to be assessed and treated."Tests will take place there to determine if they have the flu or another type of GI illness," Reitz said. "We’ve also heard from many others across campus who’ve reported being ill in recent days, and we’re providing treatment at Student Health Services for those who need it."It's unknown at this time whether there's a particular virus outbreak at the campus.
