If this is being brought up shouldn’t we also addressing the age of the politicians in places of power tho?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^NEVER LET THIS POST DIEHonestly this is the dumbest thing i have ever heard lmao so who’s gonna vote for our social security and medicare? young people??? Do you have TIME to vote? do you vote for your city mayors and our members of congress? Did you know that a majority of our voters are seniors and even if you revoked their right to vote who do you think raised their kids and their kids’ kids’ ideals? So at 65 people should just drop dead huh… how about we just idk um exercise our right to vote instead of complaining that someone else did?!Police say the agent — part of a fugitive task force involving ICE and officers with the Detroit Police Department — was attempting to serve an armed robbery warrant at a home in the 9500 block of Evergreen near W. Chicago when the shooting occurred.“I am told there was no forced entry into the residence, that they were allowed inside,” said Detroit Police Chief James Craig. “And I’m also told that the agent may have been faced with a threat, and it was at that point when he decided to use deadly force.” Craig would not talk more specifically about that alleged threat.One of the eyewitnesses, a woman, shouted at the chief as she described what she claims happened. “It was 10 bullets…and did it take 10 bullets? When he came out, they didn’t have the handcuffs on him!” she said. “They shot him! He was not able to run to do nothin’. Y’all didn’t give him a chance!”
