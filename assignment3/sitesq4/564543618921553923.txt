Pearl Jam + Jack White Pick Up Grammy Awards for PackagingEven though the 57th Annual Grammy Awards won’t hit your TV screen for another few hours, some honors have already been dished out. And for hardcore music fanatics (like us), the two categories that piqued our interest early on were centered around the packaging of some very exciting releases.The award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package had some stiff competition:It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Jack White — along with Susan Archie and Dean Blackwood — took home the Grammy for their work with the pristine release of ‘The Rise & Fall of Paramount.’Looking at standard releases, the Best Recording Package category brought with it similarly tough competition:‘Lightning Bolt’ — Pearl Jam‘Formosa Medicine Show’ — The Muddy Basin Ramblers‘Indie Cindy’ — Pixies‘LP1’ — FKA Twigs‘Whispers’ — PassengerWe’re guessing you’ve already but two and two together, but Jeff Ament, Don Pendleton, Joe Spix and Jerome Turner picked up the Grammy for the exceptional visual experience they created with Pearl Jam‘s latest effort, ‘Lightning Bolt.’Diffuser would like to offer our sincere congratulations to Pearl Jam, Jack White and everyone involved with these releases!Welcome back to Diffuser.fmIt appears that you already have an account created within our VIP network of sites on .
