The video continues to explain to their enemies that they are “young, or old, gay or straight… from all races, countries, religions, and ethnicity. United as one, divided by zero.”The video seeks to inform the public that “the terrorists that are calling themselves [the] Islamic State (ISIS) are not Muslims.”Follow the prefacing “clarification,” the video explains the following, direct to ISIS specifically:We will hunt you, take down your sites, accounts, emails, and expose you… From now on, no safe place for you online… You will be treated like a virus, and we are the cure… We own the internet… We are Anonymous; we are Legion; we do not forgive, we do not forget, Expect us.Some of ISIS Twitter accounts, that were taken offline by Anonymous, RedCult team as part of #OpISIS are as follows:Anonymous assures us that there are “more to come.” In fact, as we were writing this article, our sources within Red Cult contacted us with more accounts to update. Bookmark this page, as we suspect there will be more updates soon.If you don’t believe in God then what are you guys arguing about? Shut your damn mouths and we will all see in the end, k? Stop trying to “prove” that there is no God. If you don’t believe then why are you even talking about it? I never once saw a “believer” be an ass trying to make people believe something they don’t!! Give it up!! WE BELIEVE in God, that’s our choice as is yours not to. PeaceIronfistathiest. Again, you should read your own comments. You contradict yourself. You preach tolerance through advocacy of violence, murder, and your own condescending speech on what others believe. How thin the air must be on your self serving podium of erroneously perceived high moral character clearly starving you of oxygen and clear rational thought. You cannot preach tolerance by calling those who believe in their own religion fools, and suggesting the murder of survivors in the aftermath of an instigated and supported (by atheists such as yourself) war between factions of different faith. Again, extremist perspective and speech. Your screen name for crying out load screams of the essence of extremism…Ironfistatheist…get real, Man. Also, extremism as you have been suggesting is not all inclusive to religion, it occurs in both secular and non secular society. ( Nazi extermination of millions of Jews is a prime example…or are you pacifist and believe that did not happen? …or the ethnic Cleansing between the Hutus and tutsi tribes of Rwanda in the 1990s.) Again, I also suggest you do a little research on the birth of religion. Judaism, Islam and others are a branch off Christianity…then do some research on the history Catholicism…that will bring up to Martin Luther, and how the Catholic Church separated into Protestants, Lutheran, Tabernacle etc…and more recently Mormon and Church of Later Day Saints. …then that will demonstrate to you how indeed, the formation of the original 13 colonies were founded on religious principle. What is important to note, that in writing the Constitution, it was imperative that there was separation from church and state in the governance of the country. This was designed so that U.S. citizens and migrants from Europe and other countries could have the freedom to practice their own religion without the fear of persecution…whether it be Lutherism, Protestant, Catholic, Islam the Ancient Greek Gods, or a five year olds belief that Walt Disney is the Patron Saint to childhood innocence and wonder. There is some truth to what you have mentioned that Catholics killed those who refused to convert…but you fail to consider the timeline. That was true for the crusaders and the conquistadors…and part of why Martin Luther branched off the Catholic Church with his own interpretation of the bible and Christianity. It is the obligation and responsibility of a true Christian to spread the word of God, but it falls short of damning those who are not receptive. As the old saying goes, you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Those who spread the word of God, and berate and damn those in the name of God who are not receptive are not speaking for God or of God, and are expressing extremist interpretations. It is not our role to judge others…but to accept and love for who they are. What is Ironic, is you do not have to believe in any religion to live by the same philosophy. An Ironic twist to consider, is that wars fought today under the guise of secularism are predominately fought in under developed countries with a very weak or non existent middle class and highly corrupt governments. Wars that have been fought among developed nations have been for the interests of the political economy…wars fought between developed nations and developing states have also been for the interests of political economy as well as that of political hegemony or influence within a region…i.e. Vietnam, Korea, and yes even Iraq…as well the U.S. support of Iraq during the Iran/Iraq war in the 1980s. You preach tolerance by demeaning those who believe in any type of religion, and that makes you a bigot and a fool. You have the right to believe or not to believe…the U.S. Constitution gives you that right. Are you willing to change the constitution so that your “belief” is the dominant ideology? Are you advocating for the censorship of religious writings that are a great part of our human history and huge part of our human culture regardless of ethnic background? What if the constitution was changed and religion banned…do we then murder those of faith, or persecute them, and leave them to rot in interment camps? Where does political ideology fall into play…where does it end? What about that tolerance you say you supposedly believe in? The point is, MAN is imperfect and socially highly complex beyond any known science…we are compassionate and hedonistic, there will always be a yin and a yang…opposing ideology to every other ideology. Finally, you make assumptions on what I believe, yet I have made no mention of where my faith resides, it is irrelevant to the discussion…I do however believe that we all have the right to practice our religions peacefully, and yes…I even embrace your right to believe in atheism. Religion will never be eradicated because since man became self aware, he/she has always sought a reason for his or her being…and that has manifested in different forms of faith. In your comments it seems you are confused and have a hard time in communicating what you believe. Your argument(s) hold no merit for what I have explained. If you truly believed in tolerance, than you would not be berating religion and advocating murder and violence towards those who hold opposing ideals from your own, you can’t have it both ways…it is not helpful and non conducive to solving the complex problems plaguing the modern global society.sophieOutstanding and educated post!http://www.mintpressnews.com/ Nathan abu NevadaWhy do so many Catholics, Mormons and Protestants, Lutherans and Baptists vote for Politicians who arm and fund ISIS to kill Christians in the Middle East? Is it because they are Semitic or because they are non Zionist or both?Stu MacdonaldNathan, provide me reputable sources which support and substantiate your claim, and will in kind reply.Robert BradburyOther than getting order of religions wrong, great post. Judaism was first, Jesus was an unconventional Jew with new teachings, and those that followed his teachings (disciples) were called Christians first in Antioch. (Acts 11:26) Then Constantine and the councils of Nicea created the Roman Catholic church which held sway until Martin Luther pinned his 95 thesis on the cathedral door, and Protestants have branched from there. As far as pushy religions, have you met Jehovah’s Witnesses? Some of them are very pushy, but every religion has its zealots.

It is the worlds only democracy.Why didn’t Twitter and Facebook take down those accounts themselves if they were affiliated with Isis?meomyWe, the boomers, love our children and their friends and wanted nothing but much better for them, then for ourselves. This world is showing how poverty and fear can cause so much pain, hatred and sorrow. It’s so important to keep our eyes open to those in need before they suffer too much, to love. But, also, if those who are Christian, hate, hurt and harm, they have no excuse, because they know Someone Greater Who was hated and hurt and harmed, so we boomers’ and younger should love until it hurts and be an example to all human beings that love and help is the answer……pray when we have nothing to give, give all we can, and love every one who comes into our life, as an encouragement.

The world needs to remember that obama is supporting all muslim extremists. He is a PROFESSED muslim, of his own admission. His speeches demonstrate the fact. When he forgets that the Crusades were started BECAUSE of the invasion of Jerusalem by the muslims, and they were killing the Jews AND the Christians alike. The creator of the CULT called Islam, wrote about the GENOCIDE of the JEWS. Mohamed asked his followers to LIE to the Infidel, ( the NON muslims), to kill the Infidel, to destroy all Jews and their country. obama is a follower of the extreme jihadis and supporter of the barbaric worthless extremists. Realize also that there are extremist Jews, extremist Christians, extremist Buddhists,( yes as bizarre as it sounds). We need to stop ALL extremists. PERIOD.Nic FYep cause every Muslim prays at the wailing wall with Menora on.depthnice guys showem what a 10 looks like in their 1/4 arses loljohn BaldwinWhat I like about Anonymous is that they seem to be guided by good conscious and their only agenda is to actively fight those who would lead the world into chaos .julea bacallI hope this helps my fellow Dems on the Left to see that these jihadists for Islam are not ‘freedom fighters’ or any other such nonsense.

Skin em alive!!!Patricia Stoneall the comments that follow are a prime example of the ,practice of one up-manship that plagues the world . Every one has to prove they know it all. No room for seeing and understanding , just petty quibbling,clinton kevinMany people jump into conclusions and says that ISIS is Islamic , but that is wrong because All the actions of isis are ALL against the teachings of the Quran and also All muslims around the world are totally against isis and its actions , just like all Christians are against the killing made by the clux klan and by the catholic church in the crusades .islam is totally against the killing of innocent people because the quran itself says in chapter 5 verse 32 :” who ever kills one person it is like he killed the whole mankind and whoever saves one person it is like he saved the whole mankind ” also in islam whoever kills injustly will dwell forever in hell fire quran 25:68-69 says :”And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty. ”*muslims are commanded to make peace and not war because the quran chapter 2 verse 224 says :” And do not make [your oath by] Allah an excuse against being righteous and fearing Allah and making peace among people. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.” And also quran chapter 8 verse 61 says: “But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in God: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things). “* but islam also grant muslims the right to defend themselves if their lands is occupied , but only self defense and not offensive war , just like if Russia occupy England so the English people have the right to defend themselves and to protect their wives and their kids from getting raped that is why the quran give permission to only self defense in chapter 4 verse 75 it says :” And what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the cause of Allah and [for] the oppressed among men, women, and children who say, “Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper? ” , so the quran allows only self defense and helping the oppressed and not offensive war , but isis make an offensive war so isis is not Islamic at all . the only exception is the war between israelians and palestinians , you know in the bible in genesis 21:13 God himself told abraham that ishmael is his son and his descendant , and God in genesis 15:18 gave all the land to All the descendant of abraham who are ishmael and his descendant who are the arabs and to isaac and his descendants who are the jews and the christians , so God did not gave the land only to the jews and to the christians BUT he gave the land to ishmael and his descendants too according to genesis 15:18 . so that land of isreal should be called the land of abraham and the jews and the christians and the arabs all have the right to live in that land without exception without selfishness.*and also even during self defense-war muslims are forbidden to kill non combattant and emissaires and children and women because quran chapter 4 verse 90 forbids the killing of non combatant and women and children the verse says :” So if they withdraw from you, and fight not against you, and offer you peace, then Allah has opened no way for you against them. ”.and The prophet prohibited the killing of women,children and innocents :Another contains, “…Do not kill a woman, nor a child, nor an old, aged man’ [Narrated by Baghawi, through his isnad [Sharh al-Sunnah, 11/11]. He said, “This is an authentic hadith, narrated by Muslim.] . isis kills children and women so the actions of isis is not Islamic because the killing of children and women is against the teaching of the quran and of the prophet muhammed pubh . the actions of isis is more biblical because the bible order the killing of women and infants in 1 Samuel 15:2-3 :Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.” and 2 Chronicles 15:13 :”All who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman. ”* some people mentions quran chapter 9 verse 5 out of context this verse says :”then kill the polytheists wherever you find them ” I am asking please read the verse before it wich is quran chapter 9 verse 4 it says :”Excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you; so complete for them their treaty until their term [has ended]. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous [who fear Him]. ” it means islam allows only self defense only towards the people who attack muslims, and islam forbid attacking people who have treaty of peace with muslims and who do not attack muslims .*and even during the self defense-war if the muslims capture a combatant enemy they should never kill him according to the quran because the quran chapter 9 verse 6 says :”And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah . Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.” and also the quran forbids the killing of captives because quran chapter 76 verse 8 and 9 says :””(The righteous are those) who feed the poor, the orphan and the captive for the love of God, saying: ‘We feed you for the sake of God Alone; we seek from you neither reward nor thanks.'” but isis kills captives like prisoners and journalists so isis is not Islamic ,the actions of isis is more biblical because in the book of numbers 31:13-18 moses was ordered by the God of the bible to kill all captives including man and women and boys but to save virgins to rape them later* and the quran chapter 2 verse 256 says :” there is no compulsion in religion “‘ but isis force non muslims to become muslims so isis is not Islamic because quran 2:256 forbids forcing people to accept islam , rather forcing someone to accept a religion is biblical because 2 Chronicles 15:13 says :”All who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman. ”*Isis burn people alive , this is against the teaching of the prophet muhammed pubh who said :”’ only the God of fire can burn people inton the fire “ , but interestingly the bible order the burning of people alive : “If a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.” — Leviticus 20:14“And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.” — Leviticus 21:9“Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.” — Genesis 38:24“He that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath. … And Joshua … took Achan … and his sons, and his daughters … And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire.” — Joshua 7:15, 24-25*isis mutilate the bodies of dead people and put it on sticks , this is against the teachings of the prophet muhammed pubh because he said in hadeeth of Ibn `Abbas says: The Messenger of Allah, when dispatching his troops, would tell them, ” ..Do not behave treacherously, nor misappropriate war-booty, nor mutilate [those whom you kill], nor kill children, nor the people in cloisters.” [Narrated by Ahmad, Tirmidhi (who graded it hasan sahih ]). But interestingly the bible order the mutilation of dead bodies in numbers 25:3-4Also the bible allows the nailing of the heads of captives :“Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.” (Judges 4:21)CommentIn verse 16 the Israelites surprise Sisera’s army and that “there was not a man left,” except Sisera who deserts his army and flees, a deed punishable by court martial today. Sisera then goes to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber. Jael takes him in, hides him under a blanket, gives him milk to quench his thirst, and promises to stand guard at the door while he sleeps. Then Jael kills Sisera!so the conclusion is isis is not Islamic at all because ALL its acts is against the teachings of the quran and of the prophet muhammed pubh , rather isis is acting according to the teachings of the bible.the religion of islam is about worshipping only the God of abraham alone without a son nor a father nor a wife nor a partner , the religion of islam is to worship only the unseen God of abraham alone ,who had no image and that no body ever seen ,and who never was born or was dead , and he is not God and man at the same time , and the word ISLAM is an arabic word wich mean total submission to the will of God , so then the word muslim means someone who worship only the God of abraham alone without partner plus he submitt his will to this God of abraham , and this God of abraham is Allah.in islam we believe in all the prophets of the bible without distinction , we believe that adam noah abraham ishamel isreal joseph moses zakharia john the baptist and jesus and muhammed peace and bless be upon them all to be the mighty prophets of God , but we beleive that they are only messengers and prophets only and not God himself or partners with God . so muslims clearly view jesus as a prophet and messiah but not God and we believe he will comeback in the future to kill the antichrist .and this message of islam was delivered to a last messenger and prophet who is the prophet muhammed peace and bless be upon him .is jesus God according to the bible ?*many people saw the face of jesus but they did not die the first time they saw him ,this prove that jesus can not be God , because :exodus 33:20 God said :” no one can see my face and live ” , so if jesus was really God then the first time his mother saw his face when she delivered him she would have been died immediately but instead of that she survived , also all his disciples they did not die the first time they saw the face of jesus wich prove he can not be God.*also God can not be God and a man at the same time because :in hosea 11:9 God said :” i am God and not a man ”*also God can not change his nature and become a man because:in Malachi 3:6 :” i the LORD do not change ”this prove that God is not a man and will not change his nature and become a man .in islam we believe and worship only the God of abraham alone . we view jesus as only a prophet of God and the bible agrees with that* jesus clearly said to God almighty in john 17:3 : you are the ONLY TRUE GOD*jesus even predicted that people after him will make the false worship to worship jesus instead of God Almighty , jesus said in matthew 15:9 “they worship me in vain , all they are doing is following doctrines of men ‘*the Quran says that jesus is only a man , and the bible agree with that becausethe book of acts 2:22 said :”jesus is a man ” , also jesus himself in john 8:40 said :” i am a man ” and therefor jesus can not be God because God himself said in hosea 11:9″ i am God and not a man”*the quran says that jesus is a prophet and the bible agree with that becauseluke 24:19 says :”jesus is a prophet”*the title of “son of God” has been given to many other prophets before the birth of jesus , for example isreal was called son of God and firstborn in exodus 4:22 , ephreaim was called firstborn and son of God in jeremiah 31:9 , david was called begotten son of God in psalms 2:7 . so here we have to be consitant either we say all those prophets are the real literal sons of god and thus everyone of them will make a trinity with God , or we say no one of them is the litearal son of God and this title son of God is metaphoric and it means only someone loved by God because this person is rightous and he deliver the message of God to humanity , and this agrees with the quran because the quran said noone is the literal son of God .. it says that jesus and his disciples spoke the aramaic language , and I have for you here the website of the aramaic english dictionary : http://www.atour.com/dictionary/. please go to this online aramaic english dictionary and translate the word ” God” , you will see that the translation of the word God in aramaic is ” ALLAH ” , wich means jesus and his disciples when they pray God they actually say ” oh ALLAH ” . Wich means jesus and his disciples worshipped ” ALLAH “. Also the moslims when they pray they put their forehead on the ground , well jesus also when he prayed God he put his face on the ground , you can find in Matthew 26:39 that jesus when he prayed God he put his face on the ground exactly like moslims when they pray. So jesus prayed like moslims exactly wich mean jesus was MOSLIM.Also if you read john 1:19 it shows that the jews they know already that a prophet will come after the messiah that is why the jews asked john the baptist if he is the messiah and he said no , after that they asked him if he is that prophet , wich means the jews they know that there will be another prophet and only one prophet after the messiah because the verse said ” that prophet ” and it did not say ” those prophets” . and that prophet is muhammed , because the name muhammed is mentionned in the old testament. the name muhammed means “lovelly” and it is mentionned in the song of solomon 5:16 in the originel hebrew language “Hikow mamtaqiym wkulow MAHAMADiym zeh dowdiy wzeh ree`iy bnowt yruushaalaaim”.the hebrew word written is MAHAMAD , please go tohttp://biblehub.com/text/songs/5-16.htm and you will see the originel verse in the originel hebrew and how it is spelled with english letters .So as you see Allah is the real name of God even in the language of jesus himself, and jesus is only a prophet not God , and muhammed pubh is the last prophet and he is mentioned by name in the orginel Hebrew bible .There are many other miracles which the Prophet performed related in the Sunnah, or conglomeration of the sayings, deeds, approvals, and descriptions of the Prophet.*Curing the blind :Al-Bayhaqi stated, in the Dalail (The Signs), “Abu Sad al-Malini informed us quoting Abu Ahmed b. Adi, quoting Abu Yala, quoting Yahya al-Himmant, quoting Abd al-Aziz b. Sulayman b. al-Ghasil, from Asim b. Umar b. Qatada, from his father, from his grandfather Qatada b. al-Numan, that his eye was wounded at Badr and that its pupil came down on his cheekbone. They were about to slice it off, but asked the Messenger of God (SAAS) who said they should not do this. He then said a prayer for him, covering his cheek with his palm. And later you could not tell which of his eyes had been struck!”According to one account, this became the better eye.An account came down to us from the Commander of the Believers, Umar b. Abd al- Aziz that when he was told this account by Asim b. Umar b. Qatada, he also recited:In Medina Muhammad used to deliver sermons leaning on a tree stump. When the number of worshippers increased, someone suggested a pulpit be built so he can use it to deliver the sermon. When the pulpit was built, he abandoned the tree trunk. Abdullah ibn Umar, one of the companions, gave an eye-witness testimony of what happened. The trunk was heard weeping, the Prophet of mercy went towards it and comforted it with his hand.[1]The event is also confirmed through eye-witness testimony transmitted through the ages with an unbroken chain of reliable scholars (hadith mutawatir).[2]*The Flowing of WaterOn more than one occasion when people were in dire need of water, the blessing of the Muhammad saved them. In the sixth year after the he migrated from Mecca to Medina, Muhammad went to Mecca for pilgrimage. In the long journey through the desert, people ran out of all water, only the Prophet was left with a vessel with which he performed ablution for prayers. He put his hand in the vessel, water began flowing from between his fingers. Jabir ibn Abdullah, who witnessed the miracle, says of the fifteen hundred men, ‘We drank it and made ablution.’[3] This miracle has been transmitted with an unbroken chain of reliable scholars (hadith mutawatir).[4]The sprouting of water from human fingers is similar to the Moses’ miracle of producing water from a rock.*Blessing of FoodOn more than one occasion, the Prophet blessed food by either praying or touching it so all present could get their fill. This happened at times when food and water shortage afflicted Muslims.[5] These miracles took place in the presence of a large number of people and is, thus, not possible to deny.*Healing the SickAbdullah ibn Ateek broke his leg and Muhammad healed it by wiping his hand over it. Abdullah said it was as if nothing had happened to it! The person who witnessed the miracle was another companion, Bara’ ibn Azib (Saheeh Al-Bukhari)During the expedition of Khyber, Muhammad healed the painful eyes of Ali ibn Abi Talib in front of a whole army. Ali, many years later, became the fourth caliph of Muslims.[6]*Exorcising DevilsMuhammad exorcised the devil out of a boy brought by his mother for healing to him by saying, ‘Come out! I am Muhammad, the Messenger of God!’ The woman said, ‘By the One who sent you with the truth, we have never seen anything wrong with him since.’[7]*Prayers Answered(1) The mother of Abu Hurayra, a close companion of Muhammad, used to speak ill of Islam and its prophet. One day, Abu Hurayra came weeping to Muhammad and asked him to pray for his mother to be saved. Muhammad prayed and when Abu Hurayra returned home he found his mother ready to accept Islam. She bore the testimony of faith in front of her son and entered Islam.[8](2) Jarir ibn Abdullah was commissioned by the Prophet to rid the land of an idol worshipped besides God, but he complained he was could not ride a horse well! The Prophet prayed for him, ‘O God, make him a strong horseman and make him one who guides and is guided .’ Jarir testifies he never fell off his horse after the Prophet prayed for him.[9](3) The people were struck with famine during the time of Muhammad. A man stood up when Muhammad was delivering the weekly sermon on Friday, and said, ‘O Messenger of God, our wealth has been destroyed and our children are starving. Pray to God for us.’ Muhammad raised his hands in prayer.Those in attendance testify that that the moment he lowered his hands after praying, clouds began to build like mountains!By the time he stepped down off his pulpit, rain was dripping from his beard!It rained the whole week till next Friday!The same man stood up again, complained this time, ‘O Messenger of God, our buildings are destroyed, and our property is drowned, pray to God for us!’Muhammad raised his hands and prayed, ‘O God, (let it rain) around us, but not on us.’Those in attendance testify that the clouds withdrew in the direction he pointed, the city of Medina was surrounded by clouds, but there were no clouds over it![10](4) Here is the beautiful story of Jabir. He testifies that one time, the camel he was riding was exhausted because it was used for carrying water. The camel could hardly walk. Muhammad asked him, ‘What’s the matter with your camel?’ On finding out how tired the poor camel was, Muhammad prayed for the poor animal and from that time, Jabir tells us, the camel was always ahead of others! Muhammad asked Jabir, ‘How do you find your camel?’ Jabir responded, ‘It is well, your blessing has reached it!’ Muhammad bought the camel from Jabir on the spot for a piece of gold, with the condition that Jabir ride it back to the city! On reaching Medina, Jabir says he brought the camel to Muhammad the next morning. Muhammad gave him the piece of gold and told him to keep his camel![11]It is no wonder why those around him who witnessed these great miracles performed in front of crowds were certain of his truthfulness.Please get the facts straight and read for yourself the authentic source of islam wich is the quran itself at http://www.quran.comMany have thanked Anonymous for this job. So no, I don’t think I’m doing a lousy job. I think you’re just a malcontent posting away.DaniSoooo basically, the government is shutting down it’s own accounts?DCIts amazing how the comments about this article went from praising the work of the hackers to shut down terrorist recruiting web sites to political bull! Our situation is no one fault but our own and this article has nothing to do about it! Bitch to your elected representative! When our military was sent off to fight at 18 years old but they could not vote for the people who sent them there, somehow the people got the voting age lowered without the internet! Imagine what could be done with the power on the net if everyone flooded their reps with e-mails! Send your comments to THEM!!! I do!RogerDC….you are so right about flooding elected officials…..I worked for small local government for 30+years….it became clear that a small number of letters, phone calls etc did have impacts. Politicians know if they get 100 calls on an issue….there is likely 10 to 1000 times as many voters concerned about the issue.We the people do have unlimited power if we pull in a common direction. But the elite, the wealth, the anti-change, anti-progress, status quo minority, the Media and other institutions work hourly, day after day to miss-inform, miss-lead, confuse and bate voters. I know they truly fear voters.And finally, I do thank Anonymous for their efforts at so called ISIS!john BaldwinYours is the best post I’ve read today and the best reply to a sensible statement.RogerThank you John. I am old, so my time is up so to speak but I truly believe and know if all the phony divisiveness were reduced, if we the people understood our common goals, the “system” would be overwhelmed.Ha ha….I love it. I hope this is true and real….Sure puts my hope back in mankind that there are people out there looking to do true good for all and not supposed “Self-centered” Good for a particular race/ religion or sect….Keep us honest. Its all for one world or not at all.PastProphetthis is so much better than breaking xbox live, use of that vast talent for something good!MIGUELIn my conversations, I refer to Islamic state as …isis(ies). they wear a mask and hide, picking on people that can not defend themselves…..but when military or people with weapons come, they run or die. I like the latter of the 2. DIE ISIS(IES).BuckTardThe video seeks to inform the public that “the terrorists that are calling themselves [the] Islamic State (ISIS) are not Muslims.”WRONG. They are Muslims. People need to get that. They are Muslim extremists. That doesnt make them any less Muslim. The things they are doing are almost all preached by the prophetNic FWrong. They’re Jews. Zionists. This is a ploy to invade the Middle East again and a convenient way for Israel to defeat Mossad.Nic FSounds more like the Jewish Talmud to me“The Jews are called human beings, but the non-Jews are not humans. They are beasts.”– Talmud: Baba mezia, 114b“Every Jew, who spills the blood of the godless (non-Jews), is doing the same as making a sacrifice to God.”– Talmud: Bammidber raba c 21 & Jalkut 772“A heretic Gentile you may kill outright with your own hands.”– Talmud, Abodah Zara, 4b“It is permitted to take the body and the life of a Gentile.”– Sepher ikkarim III c 25“It is the law to kill anyone who denies the Torah. The Christians belong to the denying ones of the Torah.”– Coschen hamischpat 425 Hagah 425. 5Nic FGood goyim. More wars for Israel. Kill the gentiles while us Jews get richer.“The Jews are called human beings, but the non-Jews are not humans. They are beasts.”– Talmud: Baba mezia, 114b“The Akum (non-Jew) is like a dog. Yes, the scripture teaches to honor the the dog more than the non-Jew.”– Ereget Raschi Erod. 22 30“Even though God created the non-Jew they are still animals in human form. It is not becoming for a Jew to be served by an animal. Therfore he will be served by animals in human form.”– Midrasch Talpioth, p. 255, Warsaw 1855“A pregnant non-Jew is no better than a pregnant animal.”– Coschen hamischpat 405“The souls of non-Jews come from impure sprits and are called pigs.”– Jalkut Rubeni gadol 12b“Although the non-Jew has the same body structure as the Jew, they compare with the Jew like a monkey to a human.”– Schene luchoth haberith, p. 250 b“If you eat with a Gentile, it is the same as eating with a dog.”– Tosapoth, Jebamoth 94b“If a Jew has a non-Jewish servant or maid who dies, one should not express sympathy to the Jew. You should tell the Jew: “God will replace ‘your loss’, just as if one of his oxen or asses had died”.”– Jore dea 377, 1“Sexual intercourse between Gentiles is like intercourse between animals.”– Talmud Sanhedrin 74b“It is permitted to take the body and the life of a Gentile.”– Sepher ikkarim III c 25“It is the law to kill anyone who denies the Torah. The Christians belong to the denying ones of the Torah.”– Coschen hamischpat 425 Hagah 425. 5“A heretic Gentile you may kill outright with your own hands.”– Talmud, Abodah Zara, 4b“Every Jew, who spills the blood of the godless (non-Jews), is doing the same as making a sacrifice to God.”– Talmud: Bammidber raba c 21 & Jalkut 772MaskedMarvylI’m not quite sure why governments around the world had not already done this…..Joe Smuckwe r leejun.Muellerthank you Anonymous for brightening my outlook on life, you guys rule…keep up fightin the good fightbanana juiceThank you Anonymous, you are okay.

ISIS changed their name to IS over six months ago, Anon you are not using their correct name. 2. Some Anon members are also Pagan and using the name ISIS is of great offence to those who follow Isis. 3. The FBI was leaving terrorist activity up on purpose to track them and has stated so. So, if Anon removes IS members they can not be tracked. 4. I agree that IS should be exposed but not hacked into and removed. Removing them will only give them more power and we will not be able to track/trace the enemy.RayRock on you Hacktivists! We all are Legion…. Kicking Ass and takin names.Jane SmithSomething has to be done to put an end to ISIS, even if this isn’t the cure-all, it’s still having an impact and I say more power to them!denisicleHacking for peace.love ithurricanepaulThe only thing they got wrong was saying the IS are “not Muslims”. The original Muslims were all about Jihad. Jihad is all about killing those who don’t subscribe to their religion. What happened, was a group of Muslims decided to ‘hijack Islam’ and make it more peaceful, living together with all other religions . The “peaceful Muslims” hijacked Islam from the “true Muslims” who were all about Jihad. The Islamic State is a group of “old school” Muslims who want their “old school” religion back where it belongs, in their hands. So, in reality, and in the eyes of all of the Jihadists out there, it’s the “peaceful Muslims” who are the ones who are “not Muslims”.Dija NeauxIf nothing else, this article only started a fight between young and old, in years. Stupid picks no particular age. Intelligence does. Anonymous may doing a good job, but does anyone notice that the links are all led to a Arabic-sounding names? They’ll probably change that after reading this post.izu zIS = International SadistsdeanomhI used to like Pong back in the 70’s. Groovy. Then I got a taste for Pac-Man and Asteroids. Totally cool.

Hackers unite to destroy ISIS.http://www.mcdonalds.com Turd BurglarThe only thing that can take down ISIS is the combined efforts of Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van Damme, and Chuck Norris.MHI’m glad Anonymous “clarified” for me that the members of ISIS really aren’t “muslims.” I had been under the mistaken impression that they were all just disgruntled former members of the Carol Burnett Show.I also recently found out that during WWII, the Nazis weren’t really “German.” Because you know, real Germans wouldn’t do those kinds of things.Remove your head from your ass. You’re so scared to admit the truth of a situation for fear it leads to “All muslims are ISIS.” And that’s not the case. Until you can get your primitive, pea-sized brain around the fact that “Most members of ISIS are muslims” – you have absolutely zero hope in hell of understanding an enemy you (maybe, maybe not – I don’t know what side you’re on here) hope to defeat.BLThank you, Anonymous! I’m so glad to see you fighting the good fight against these monsters and taking on other issues of social justice. Now, about those credit reporting agencies…RomyISIS is miswritten.

Anyway, as a social scientist I couldn’t agree more about Scientology. Or ISIS. What bothers me, well, one of the things that bothers me, is the word, itself. When one adds ‘ology’ to the end of a word, it means ‘the study of.’ So, Scientology means the study of Science…something they know nothing about! They boast only 50,000 members worldwide, but command a $50 billion empire. They court celebrities, with psychological vulnerabilities that can be easily manipulated through pseudo-friendship. Those looking for something to erase their feelings of self-hate, -loathing, -inadequacy, et cetera, that they hide behind bravado and the like. Why? Because theyhave deep pockets. IIt’s sad.What’s for dinner?AWESOME!Jim“the terrorists that are calling themselves [the] Islamic State (ISIS) are not Muslims.”Well, they sure put on a pretty convincing show. With a few exceptions, like the burning alive of a Jordanian pilot, pretty much everything they do comes directly from Muhammad’s playbook. Muhammad didn’t have modern firepower, but he did the same things ISIS is doing – taking his army from one city to the next, recruiting the men who would join, killing the men who wouldn’t, and taking the women and children captive. Further, there is no central authority within Islam, so nobody defines who is and is not a Muslim. The Sunnis say that the Shia aren’t true Muslims. The Shia say the Sunnis aren’t true Muslims. Both of them say the Ahmaddiya aren’t true Muslims. In the end, they’ll support anyone who proclaims the shahadah (the Islamic pronouncement of faith) over anyone who doesn’t. ISIS fits the bill as well as any other group since they have the first half of the shahada printed on their flag. Other Muslims might say that ISIS doesn’t represent Islam, but that’s a dodge used to fool infidels. The truth is that no one group represents all of Islam, and they darn well know it. However, few Muslims would claim that ISIS aren’t Muslims. They might say that they are radicals or extremists or even terrorists. They might say that ISIS are not TRUE Muslims, sort of like mainstream Christians say that Mormons aren’t true Christians, but they wouldn’t say that ISIS aren’t Muslims. It’s interesting that Anonymous believes they have the authority to make this declaration.“…divided by zero”Sounds like a fatal exception. (That’s a computer science joke.)“We own the internet…”I was sympathetic up until this. Nobody “owns” the internet. Billions of people own very small pieces of the internet, and thousands of companies and governments own substantially larger chunks of it, but no one group owns all of it, in spite of the power they believe they have. It’s this sort of arrogance that will make them enemies rather than friends of most people.meAnd NOW the media cheers for Anonymous. When your enemies are destroying your enemies, You cut them some slack, HUH?bob-o the clownuh oh, Obama and his buddies are gonna hate that.sittinginthesunNew way?

And dont tell me “free speech” because they have closed twitter and facebook accounts for lessPuddentainIf a group of very important/wealthy individuals ever wanted to circumvent the Constitution a good modern way to do it would be to buy a few of the best hackers & call them “Anonymous”. The top few could be paid to undertake or initiate a large scale initiative & “volunteers” wishing to be a part of the the organization, would volunteer for free but doing good for some worthwhile cause…..Great front for a CIA or similar group. I’m not saying that’s what it is,,,,but it “COULD” be.Justin MustfulOh its already a given. That is the one problem with Anonymous, it can be anyone. CIA to KGB to someone trying to make a difference in the world, or just someone trying to smear the Anonymous name.Point of my whole post was, Facebook and Twitter are sponsors of terrorism. Plain and simple.Peg WilliamsAs long as they band together for the good of the world this is great. But I worry that there will come a time when a few of the more egocentric will want them to DOMINATE all internet activities and take it over. Then it will become dangerous. Lets hope there are more morally fit who can control this powerful tool that is being used for good for now.RichardNow that’s using your hacking resources to a truly deserving end! Great work! Please continue to keep cleansing the Internet of these militant scum!EnnaxorKinda like Anonymous.Oxif barack HUSSAIN obummer wasn’t sympathetic to them they wouldn’t exist anymore. he hides behind it not being ‘humane’ to destroy them. and why is it the US has to bear the burden of destroying them? what happened to the UN coalition? britain, spain, germany, italy, france. why are they in the background? we have tons of mustard gas that we are disposing of. wouldn’t it be prudent if we disposed of it on isis? oh, yea i forgot. not humane.TechGuyJoeThank you Anonymouspilgrim“Anonymous” is a communist organization? …. do they know the american media is portraying them this way????http://batman-news.com therailroaderNice move by this organization!

I realize that it will ultimately be an annoyance…but that’s it. All it will be is an annoyance.mudslideBeats sitting around whining and doing nothing….DasbyHonestly, no it doesn’t. Annoying ISIS does nothing but ensure they’ll continue to be extremely violent. Really the only thing accomplished here is making the people that did this feel better.mudslideWrong – one of their chief recruiting tools is propaganda.DasbyYou really think taking out twitter and facebook accounts is going to STOP their propaganda from allowing them to recruit from the areas they mainly recruit from? On top of that the people that they manage to recruit in places like Europe and even the United States are going to be recruited regardless of what they say on the internet.deltalady1946I’m very proud of them for doing this! Wished they had done it months ago but better late than never!samAll the sites listed under “keep a close eye on” happen to be MALAYSIANS…I wonder what that means…Online recruitment of disenfranchised Muslims in America is the most powerful tool ISIS had. Having their Jihad limited to the Syrian theater made their fight faraway and a flicker. It could only be told by Mullahs and Imams, who if found by the local authorities got jailed and most importantly, deported. Like a cancer, the use of online methods offered a level of anonymity and the farthest reaches into the world wide web. Anonymous taking down ISIS accounts has dealt the smackdown that has left ISIS is completely defenseless, in fact unarmed.DasbyI know that Anonymous means well, and to some degree doing what they did does hurt ISIS a little bit, but seriously? Keeping them off twitter and facebook is not really going to do jackshitRick WolfYeah.. This will stop the beheadings, rapes and human infernos… lulz.

Well done and many kudos, plaudits and praise from this corner of the globe.EDgreat job REDCULT team. My question is why isn’t facebook and twitter removing these accounts ????? Since corporations are people now and can help change elections can they also be held accountable as an accomplice to murder? Remember they are people now. That’s what the GOP fought for and being people doesn’t mean just giving money it means they follow laws just like people do? right? Great job Redcult team keep up the great work shut them downMarcia SmithFirst, I like the idea of hackers taking the ISIS on. Thank you. The rest of you guys (those that have again fallen into arguing the Obama-Osama connection) need to stay on topic. This is not about Obama or Osama, but about this insane terrorist group.Next, I also feel as if they need to have their audience taken away from them. We know they feel on top of the world about advertising their methods on the internet and television, but for what purpose? Are they seeking more followers? Do they seriously believe that their overt methods will bring an entire world to it’s knees or are they simply trying to show the world they mean business and to not screw with them and their self-proclaimed caliphate? Perhaps it was a miscalculation on their part in that they have discovered they did not have the enormous backing they thought they would?Notice how their purpose for having hostages is changing. Initially they seemed to have the hostages to demonstrate to the world their resolve. Now, they are holding hostages as well for the purpose of attempting to gain money it seems. That seems to indicate a deteriorating core. Perhaps we should be trying to pull followers back from them, perhaps offer them life rather than certain death?p wget emJimSelf regulating Internet police, Perfect.Mike WagnerIts about time they did something WORTHWHILE!cookie23Anon figured out quicker than the US govt how to attack ISIS in cyberspace.

Ya I know trying to keep it lite?!!I have a feeling that this is not the Anonymous people from a few years ago. It appears as if an agency has taken the name and not the knowledge. The info they had up until 2 years ago wouldn’t give them the desire to go after IS. Simply because they are small fish with a big spotlight beaming upon it compared to the people/groups they were going after a few years back.I was never sure about trusting them as a group over the past 5+ years, for they might have just been a shill setup to fool people.

Be careful what you wish for…you might just get it.James WherrySa’udi clerics have finally started to call these Jihadists “Kharajites,” an 8th century heresy identical to al-Quaeda and ISIS which was stamped out by Muslims, themselves. Egyptian clerics are now calling them “satanic,” and not “Islamists.” Denying them a link to Islam is the first step to firmly delegitimizing these groups. Regretfully, attacks on Christians, Jews and Westerners still do not draw a reaction from these groups.Jm MacNations are not genders, simpleton.Bob FowlerYou seriously took the time to correct a colloquialism? and I’m the simpleton?That was the most pressing issue that you could find to comment against?

Weird. Not to mention their ideology has a taste of “world communism” to it. I dont trust anonymous. Not so much the individuals involved, but the people who are orchestrating anonymous from the top. Who are they and what is their agenda?James WherryI’m not normally a fan of Anonymous, but I suspect they are seeking to take down authoritarianism and they view the U.S. as oppressive and dishonest to its own people.HawkstratI prefer ISIS to Anonymous.Segun Iloriwhy? If I may askHawkstratWell, I don’t really, that was hyperbole in an attempt to be funny. I just don’t like how the media refers to Anonymous as ‘hacktivists.’ They aren’t a bunch of e-Robin Hoods, they are criminals.David GreerThen go join them. Get OUT! Bye!Harley QuinnI did not expect the HACKERS of the world to fight ISIS this could get interesting… it is true that ISIS is a bunch of killers and murders of both women and children and then blame it on us Americans also trying to push an ideology onto others WHO DON’T WANT IT… it’s the old “Join us or die” speech… I am one of those who don’t like the idea of using executions on your hostages then turn it into entertainment those who join ISIS are not human beings they are MONSTERSed blakeinformation and ability to manipulate information are the ultimate power. these anonymous folks get thatJames CluckeyHow didn’t you? Anons fight anyone who hurt others or destroy freedom. They are always in the news for good deeds. Such as exposing the KKK and pedophiles.Harley QuinnUsually they fight government oppression, police brutality, teach bullies a lesson or expose some kind of dirty secret that no one knows about… just sayingJm Mac@”a bunch of killers and murders of both women and children”Both of them? Wow. /eyerollThor 9You forgot to include the slaughter of men as well. I.S. kills any who oppose their ideology.HeightsPersonThe younger generation does have a social conscious. I picketed $cientology with Anonymous and Anonymous restored my faith in the younger generation. Thank you Anonymous for exposing the cult of scientology and for doing something about the evil cult of ISIS.JimScientology needs to have some of the same treatment.HeightsPersonHmmm, you sound like a cult apologist. tsk tskSnuf Out TerrorismYou sound like a nut case. Just the fundamentalist Christian version who think religious war is good. Either way Christians or Muslims who think war on religion is sensible. Both crazy!ironfistatheisthow about the fact that religion is just crazy period. send them all to a wasteland where they can truly battle to the death and see what god is victorious. then we bomb the victors and leave the world to the rational humans. kill 2 birds with 1 stone… get rid of religion and overpopulationbubbaZealotry of any kind is wrong. There isn’t much of a difference between religious zealots and anti-religious ones.Mark McAllisterPerhaps no difference.mojoWhistle!!! Psst, Hey Guys, WTFU! There is a difference! There really is! One cut’s peoples heads off! One ges into towns and villages and persecutes peaceful law abiding citizens! One orders women to cover their faces, not lift their eyes when in public, not wear makeup or date anyone that is not approved, one allows family members to kill daughters that don’t follow the rules or they may receive female genital mutilation, or punishment for being raped!JohnThis is true, Jesus preached in the new testament Love, peace, Love your enemy, But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, Matthew 5:44. Muhammad preached kill your enemy, Hate those that do not agree with you. Don’t be like sheep, look up this stuff up for yourself. Allah is an enemy to unbelievers. – Sura 2:98, On unbelievers is the curse of Allah. – Sura 2:161ironfistatheistyaaa…cuz you christians didn’t kill your enemies or nonbelievers. you tortured them first to make them confess, then you killed them.ironfistatheistthat’s interesting… what happens if you have an infectious disease like gangrene or cancer that is clearly destroying the host(main population). you cut off what you have to in order to save the masses. you say zealotry, i say a sacrifice to save the greater goodsophieEmpty practice of religion is crazy..not true belief in God and his teachings and morals and the preciousness of life. Creeps are in every organization..even atheism. Communists tried to get rid of religion..and look at the outcome. Getting rid of the “overpopulation” does not sound too moral or rational to me.ironfistatheistwell keep poping out kids like we have infinite resources. we’re at about 7.3billion right now and growing. so your grand kids or great grand kids are going to be starving to death. seem more moral to rip the cancer out and have a fighting chance than to let it consume youmojoFACT: In order for a ‘culture, country’ to survive, 1.8 children per family is required! As I write this, the U.S. is hovering at 1.6 children…in contrast the moslim rate is 8.1, so simple math leads to an easy conclusion. Every day I watch videos of moslim clerics advocating the fall of the U.S.! They are followers of the moslim brotherhood! They are using our own constitution to bring us down, yet we are told to accept and yield. Even mere mentioning or posting anything negative in regard to them has been considered hate BUT I don;t advocate hate, only awareness! Muslims have a constitutional right to practice their religion and hold any office within the American government so long as they are sincere in protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States. However, when members of any religious, or any other kind of group openly advocate for the hijacking of the American government and ultimately the American people under the Sharia law applications of the terrorist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, their right to hold any governmental position is forfeited. Further, it is a crime, under Federal law which is punishable by fines and imprisonment, to openly advocate for the overthrow of the United States of America. Yet, this is exactly what the Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers serving in the U.S. government are doing! They openly advocate for the domination of Islam over all other religions in the United States and “to make the United States an “Islamic nation”. Be concerned world, it’s not just here…every European country is experiencing the same problem, even Russian and china! Wake up folks it is getting very real…pray for the world and a peaceful resolve…ironfistatheistyup, pray… that sure does a lot of good. while you’re at it please hold your breath.Dave SunhammerIronfistatheist… see, you sound EXACTLY like those you are ranting about. “Kill Them all! Save US from over population!”Funny how it is “kill them to save you”. Wait… no, not funny. Just typical insanity from a nutcase. Seriously dude. You cannot see your own zealotry? Of course not. So, in short, I will take your claims that the world needs saving from all of “them” when you set an example that you yourself are serious enough about overpopulation to make the big sacrifice for the team. Then, hell, I might count you a hero.ironfistatheistby the way, you say the preciousness of life? didn’t he command abraham to kill his son? if anyone told me to kill my son, i’d tell him to go f*ck himself. and how many did he kill in the fairytale of noahs ark. and i’d hate to think what he’d do to everyone that has worked on his “holy day of rest”.. which is put to death. so it doesn’t seem like he sees life as precious as you say he does.sophieIf you backtrack there a minute..Abraham was being tested by God as to his strength of faith in him. GOD stayed the angels hand as the death of the child was not what God was wanting. IT was to show a point to Abraham. As for the Holy Day working..putting to death was Old Testament stuff. Jesus Christ did not endorse anyone being put to death. He cautioned us all in the New testament to live according to the “spirit of the law”..not the “Letter.” In other words, use common sense, mercy and forgiveness. He does expect us follow the Commandments as moral guidelines. Just look at the shape the world is in..many people doing whatever the heck they feel like doing..and the hell with anyone else. And yes, God sees life more precious than any of us ever could. HE created you..and gave you free choice..to love him or not. Faith is a gift…and you can always ask for it. I am talking about true interacting faith..not hyped up personal self serving tripe that is peddled by SOME TV charlatans and wolves in sheeps clothing.ironfistatheistya he didn’t end up killing his son, but why would you associate yourself with a psychopath that would ask you something so ridiculous. as for the commandments being moral guidelines… that’s just crazy talk. 1/2 of them have nothing to do with morals and the other 1/2 can be replaced with,” don’t do anything that you wouldn’t want someone to do to you.” so what took “god” a couple hundred words to say i did in just over 12. and i’m not asking people to praise me every sunday.so who wrote the old testament? and what makes it less valid than the new one? i’m curious.sophieThe Old Testament is the Hebrew accounting of Creation and God’s Commandments and happenings as recorded by the ancient Israelites. The NEW TESTAMENT is the arrival of the PROMISED MESSIAH of the Old Testament..who is JESUS CHRIST..and His Death on the Cross for us…as prophesized in the Old Testament. The two are meant to complement the other…with some differences. The differences being that Salvation now expands beyond the hebrews and includes the gentiles that choose to love Jesus Christ as the Son of God..and to follow His teachings as in accordance with His Father’s Will. Nothing less valid…rather “good news” in Christ’s message of Hope, Salvation..Mercy..and Forgiveness..with the PROMISE of ETERNAL HAPPINESS with HIM in HEAVEN. Beats anything this world can offer. The New Testament are the recordings and accountings of Christ’s followers..the Apostles..who firsthand witnessed His miracles, love, and exhortings to live a better way and to love one another..as the sure way to Heaven…which,spiritually, is our true home.ironfistatheisti just don’t understand why people would believe in jesus the plagiarist. there’s a bunch of other gods that predate him by thousands of years with the same biography. only difference is christians converted or slaughtered them. so basically you believe whoever has the biggest stick or you die…gamesWritten by a true ignoramous.ironfistatheistyou revert to name calling because you don’t have a logical thought to disprove me. go read some religious history and expand your mindStu MacdonaldYou should seriously consider your own advice.Mark McAllisterSimpleton!Mark McAllisterI don’t agree by any means with all that ironfist says but there is no doubt that the concept of the Christian God lies in much, much earlier traditions. Baal morphed into “the true god” but what was it before that.mojoAhh, but where, who made the promise that He would rise after death and then DID IT? Of all your so called Gods, who rose from the dead? From the beginning of genesis He was promised! There are prophesy after prophesy of His coming, and they were fulfilled! Sin, Adam and Eve did it first…what did they do right after they sinned? They killed animals and then used the skin of those animals to cover up, hide their bodies from God…BLOOD was shed! This became an acceptable offering to God. From that time until the time Jesus was sacrificed Blood was shed! When Jesus was offered and sacrificed Israel stopped sacrificing animals…Why? It wasn’t because they accepted Jesus’s sacrifice, so then why did the blood sacrifices cease? Makes ya wonder huh…J.C. is a stumbling block to the Jewish faith…Even they will one day see the truth!Stu MacdonaldReferences please…now you are just making stuff up. Silly.Stu MacdonaldNo point in arguing with extremists like ironfistathiest…they won’t change their way of thinking. All people like him/her want is to engage in conflict. …and give us a tase of how groups like ISIS come about.ironfistatheistextremist? i’m not part of a group that molests children in the name of god or burns scientist for trying to learn and make the world better. to change my way of thinking would mean to let go of facts, and that just doesn’t make sense…Stu Macdonaldhow about the fact that religion is just crazy period. send them all to a wasteland where they can truly battle to the death and see what god is victorious. then we bomb the victors and leave the world to the rational humans. kill 2 birds with 1 stone… get rid of religion and overpopulation…your words. Seems pretty extremist to me. Very ideological…any idea that advocated for the extermination of masses of human beings is highly slanted towards the psychotic side. So you are here, trolling attacking others beliefs trying to get them to see your point of view…I and advocate for the killing of all those of a religious faith…exactly what you accuse of the religious historical past of doing. You sir, are what at we call an idiot. Blowing smoke, trying to show off how intelligent you think you really are…but in truth, scum like you are those who are responsible for the moral decay of society…and mind you, morality and religion do not go hand in hand. It come with decent human behavior. You really should brush up on your history of religion, then go back and read you comments. If there is any intelligence in your comments, it is very well hidden. Better to keep your mouth closed and appear a fool, than to open it and prove it. Good day, sir.ironfistatheisti’m just suggesting to speed up the process since most religions are intolerant to other. you’re going to keep having your little wars here and there. just turn it into a battle royal and get it over with. obviously morality and religion don’t go hand in hand. all you religious people pick and choose “scripture” that is convenient for your lifestyle. if you truly believe in “god” you would have no problem following his every word. but i’m willing to bet you’ve gone against his teaching. there is no room in this era for this kind of nonsense. especially when your “brothers and sisters” are knocking on my door trying to spread this garbage. grow up, and if you can’t keep it to yourselfStu Macdonald…and here you are, spreading your garbage. So what is the difference?Stu MacdonaldBad people exist in all walks of life. Fact. Even…Athiests, GASP!* say it isnt so!onestillpatrioticYou tell him Stu. He probably got his member fiddled with by someone in authority so everyone is bad. If he knew more of what he speaks of, he’d go get into a Nintendo game somewhere, something more constructive for his ANGRY attitude. Maybe his mom and dad will turn off the basement lights and he’ll have to come up to bed soon.sophieI see it as informative to one so passionate with opposite beliefs. I don’t know what Ironfistatheist background is..and how he came to choose his beliefs. His “name” says it all..as you pointed out in an EXCELLENT post you made previously. When I encounter one so opposed and with vehemence..I am reminded of Biblical Saul…who was the same in his despising and hatred of the earliest Christians. God saw that passion..and valued it so..as He also saw the deep down willingness of Saul to know the truth. And He used it so well…to bring back his child…and parlay his conversion into a monumental prism of such persuasion and charismatic brilliance..it rings throughout the centuries and will do so forever. What does the Beatitudes call us to do? Inform ,counsel, and educate those who have hardened their hearts….with charity…as we cannot know the roads they have travelled, and what life blows have bankrupted them spiritually. We have to always reach out with the assumption that they do not know the way..and with points clarified to them..we let God take over from there. But, you know this..I know. Once they ask you a question, and Ironfistatheist did..you provide the answers. Inform..not argue. Then it’s up to them.gamesUnderstanding the infinite with the finite NEVER works well!gamesNo…HE did…you not believing does not change truth…it only makes YOU a foolironfistatheistfools are the ones that need faith(believing in something unprovable). truth is supported by facts, and you have no facts.Mark McAllisterStill faith in moderation and concentrated more in ones inner life can still be a good thing.Stu MacdonaldWhat is your truth? What proof to you have that there is no God? The theory of evolution is just that…a theory based on scientific speculation.mojoJust curious, but were you there when you were created? Just curious…and were your parents ummm, no, not gonna go there…although the first people had to be incestuous …but God changed that when more and more people were born an inbreeding was no longer needed…just saying that the reason the old testament was written and why the New Testament was validated is because Jesus, the lamb of God, the promise, a sinless man came and became our path back to the creator…I can imagine this made you laugh but one day it won’t :)… Look dude, I nor you have all the answers but let’s coexist until we do. BTW, if not for the bible we may not even be here having this debate…What was used as the basis for our constitution and laws?gattacaaceSure…And do you help the homeless or anyone besides yourself?mapsguy1955Noah’s Ark is a fairy tale. We now know that it is physically impossible.gamesYeah, moron…there just happens to be an ARK on the top of Mt Ararat…right where the Bible says it should be! GROW A BRAIN!ironfistatheisti would like to see links of proof.(which i’m sure you don’t have) and there is not enough water on earth to flood it completely(if i remember correctly the flood was to kill all land animals)and if there is 2 of every animal, what did the carnivoures eat.Stu MacdonaldThe world in Biblical time was considered and thought to be much smaller than we know it. Mass flooding of the Mediterranean region could easily have been seen as a “worldly” event. Try thinking a little outside the box, ay?And of course every culture has the story. Most of the world’s major religions are based on previous religions in an effort to placate those who believe in the other religions. Christianity is a rip off mix of Judaism, Hinduism, and the Zoroastrianism of the Sassanids (who the Byzantenes sure enough fought a war with not long after the foundation of Christianity then accepted into the empire). Its not like the major world religions developed far from each other.Mark McAllisterProven to be a hoax, I won’t ask you to grow a brain, just work harder.games…not to mention…EVERY culture on the planet has the story!Mark McAllisterI suppose that a world flood would produce myths in all cultures present at the time or their descendants. Just go with physically impossible, no need to put a Ghost in the Machine.julea bacallI am not religious but there really was a flood and arks and rafts & many people have oral histories of this….even South America but there have been floods everywhere many times. A few BIG ones made it into Historical Folk lore.thaidudeSo?!Gary PierronThey didn’t actually READ the bible. It’s just some out of context drivel they heard on Faux News.ironfistatheistif you’re saying i didn’t read the bible you are wrong. i went to church every saturday and ccd on wednesdays. i was just fortunate enough to think the right questions at an early age. do you think if you told the stories of the bible to a grown adult that has never heard it before will take it seriously? cigarettes use the same strategy as the churches, if you can get them exposed to it at an early age before they know any better you can get them hooked for life.Stu MacdonaldHate to ya there Judah, acceptance occurs on a regular basis.ginaalot of people made their own rules ,changed things for their own needs and desires.some ways of thinking were barbaric,God showed Abraham and others the true way,Mark McAllisterSorry but any rational person could see that God made a bad call on that Abraham thing.sophieAnyone who puts himself on the same level as God..and THINKS he Knows how GOD thinks..would say such a thing. His ways are not our ways..and we..His creation have a limited understanding. It is only in our arrogance that we think we have His understanding.Slipp E. PhysterAn omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent god truly negates feewill. Not as we percieve it of course, but as it actually is. We go about life doing what is important to our perspective and , guided by what some call our conscience. This is free will, they say, god does not make you choose what to do with your life, or supposed after life. If you follow his will, they say, you will be rewarded. This is where free will and god’s will cant co-exist in the same reality, unless the god they mean does not have the 3 qualities required by the ‘one true god’. From our limited (consciously and physically) perspective, we can ponder and try to fathom what what it could be like to have these innate qualities but fall short of truly perceiving it; I will try none the less by using some of the examples previously stated.there was no reason for god to test Abraham’s faith; from god’s perspective of being at all places at once and at all points in time through infinity means he(i use the term for simplicity) already knows/has always known/ what Abraham’s faith was.. you may probably retort with that for Abraham’s benefit and not his own, but surely an omniscient god would know a less painful way to reveal this to Abe…the commandments themselves , depending on which sect of christianity you follow, or mormonism or judisim for that matter, are supposed to be our guide post to follow god’s will, absolute view on right or wrong, or simply moral guideposts that are applied differently in different situations .. Surely a god who knows/has always known/knew how people with their different views would carry out or twist or ignore these would, and punishing those he knew who would before he even created them hardly seems the work of a fair and just creator …. wouldnt an innate understanding of these that we all were born with be a more fair way for everyone to follow them? Jesus is brought up a lot in these ‘sabbath conversations’ which ultimately brings up I being told ‘he sent his only son to die for your sins’ .. without getting into the holy trinity discussion, since jesus is supposedly god incarnate on earth, what that statement means is god sacrifised himself to himself to save us from himself. Of course this is only true if you believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent god.the story of Noah troubles me deeply. How could an omni(everything) god ever be angry?Anger , besides being a very human emotion, stems from things happening we dont like/ dont want to happen/ didnt expect to happen all of which could not happen to an omni-god. If you knew/always have known that something you made was gonna get fucked up and piss you off would you still make it?religion and god has been created by man to control and enslave his fellow man. All those who believe in some sort of heaven afterlife are not 100% pure in their belief. Tis is evidenced by the fact that no one, NO ONE, has ever truly celebrated when a loved one died. If they really were 100% sure in their faith they would be ecstatic that their mom/brother/ son/ friend whoever got to go be with god.Those that would say I’ll be sorry someday when I’m burning in hell for this belief I have, ..if heaven is filled with assholes who would gloat at the eternal torture of any being , well that’s somewhere i wouldnt want to be. And a god who would create me and allow my existence despite knowing /aalways known that i wil/am in/have gone to hell sounds like a sadistic asswipe.. So the answer I’m told is to follow god’s will, and if thats god who is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent,… i already am, and so is Daesh, and so is everyone and everything..you just cant have it both ways, ..if their truly is a god, free will is a mootpoint, an illusion of choice experienced in the reality of your mind…or(many of you shutter to think) this free will is real and a parent like invisible man in the sky watching you masturbate and condeming you for it are the fallacy…silly monkeys killing monkeys over scraps of dirtmojoDude, your reasoning has to be put into perspective.Trying to analyse and disect the infinite by using the finite, limited knowledge is akin to an ant doing brain surgery on a human being, just saying. God has the map, He knew the end from the beginning. Just because you can’t see the wind doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist. We are about to enter what is referred to as the days of Noah, again. In those days it got harder and harder to retain and hold onto faith in God. One man stood strong and although he was laughed at and mocked, he prevailed. In those days Also today we see many reports of people being picked up by space ships and sexually molested…very interesting, coincidence? I don’t know but in the days of Noah it got pretty bad…why do we see drawings in caves depicting HUGE giant men sometimes seated on thrones? How did stonehedge and other massive structure get built? Could it be that ‘fallen angels’ equiped with knowledge that man didn’t posses and also they were giants which probably helped, but could this explain how huge rocks were moved and put in place? Could it also explain the amazing accuracy and precision that was required in building these ancient buildings? Is this where the myths of the the Greek ‘gods’ began?sophieYou are confusing human anger with the RIGHTEOUS ANGER of the ALLMIGHTY. “God’s ways are not our ways.” It is arrogant to put ourselves on the same level as God in our attempts at dictating what should be and what should not be. HE is the CREATOR..not us. That is why HE gave us the Commandments. They are to guide us morally and help us to live the way HE wants. HE promises peace of soul to those who do. That’s no chump change. It was out of supreme love that HE gave us free will, to have done otherwise we would have only been responding in robotic fashion. The LIVING GOD wants our LOVE freely. Spirituality is a growth process..and God expects this..but always with the goal of respectfully seeking the truth..WHICH will revealed to us in God’s time and his ways. He will ALWAYS bestow the GIFT of FAITH to those who earnestly seek it. That is His Benevolence. Bear in mind..a healthy”Fear of the Lord..is the beginning of Wisdom.” Think of the “Rolling Thunder and the Sea …only a taste of the wonder of the MOST HIGH. “How Great Thou Art!”julea bacallStrange, that is what I have always thought but with more civil language. If something told me to kill a child, I would be sure it was a bad entity and no good would come from it. I think some Control freak messed with that story for self interest.dreamhelmetNot a child; he was 30 something.julea bacallI meant if I were Abraham and something told me to sacrifice my young child on some alter…I would say NO and I would feel sure it was no Gd talking.gamesDidn’t God stop him from sacrificing Isaac? Therefore He did NOT allow Isaac to be sacrificed..let alone harmed. Your comment is MOOT!ginaGod did not allow Abraham to kill his son,actually when Abraham proved his faith even though he questioned it for a moment and he began to sacrifice his son,,God stopped him,it was a test of faith,,mojoPraying for you man. Somewhere along the line , maybe childhood, maybe as an adult, you had a bad experience with someone or some group that claimed to be of God…Be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water…hang in, leave the door slightly cracked cause soon the world will see God! You don’t need a book or a group, just yourself…you aren’t alone…I ain’t nobody special, I came from a catholic home, I overcame! LOL…But trust me, He is there! BTW, science has proven God, but each time they do, they wad up the paper and throw it away thinking they will prove His non existence tomorrow, but that won’t happen…Noah was real…we are actually going through a similar time right here, right now! it’s going to get harder and harder to believe, the dark side is running things, killing off all those that believe, changing the history books, re writing history…but hang in there and if you are so sure that God doesn’t exist try this, unless your afraid…get yourself in a calm place out of site, sit or kneel down and ask God what you are to Him? He’ll show ya…be sincere thoughironfistatheistjesus fucking christ that was the most painful thing i have read to date… people rewriting the history books? give me a break. there is no proof in “god” or else it would be irrefutable… which it is not. that is why science prevails and religion is for the weak minded that can’t handle the truth… the FACTS that have been discovered. are you that delusional that you need some made up deity that has been copied from previous gods??? look up the origins of buddah, krishna, odysseus, romulus, dionysus, heracles, glycon, zoroaster, attis of phrygia, horus. if anything they are the true god and you’re worshiping some piece of shit that just copied everything they did. and if you’re one of those religious people that think god put those stories their to test our faith, then you are a hopeless cause. i really hope you read about religion that predates your beliefs, you might learn somethingmojoA lot of hate their man but it’s cool. It’s all relative to the invitation! Your time will come, trust me. I was the same at one point but then BAM, He was there! All the words in Webster’s won’t change your mind, and that’s a fact Jack! No animosity here bro because I know that I know that I know and I also know that your day will come! You need to cross check your facts my man, here are just a couple. (1)Jesus Christ was a historical person about whom many ancient authors wrote. He is recorded in Roman history as well, even the stone that was moved, the missing body etc.(2)Prior to 1853 there were some who did not believe that the nation of Israel crossed the Red Sea as mentioned in the Old Testament (Exodus 14:13-31).They claimed the Israelites really walked across ankle deep water. There are problems with this view. The first is very obvious – how did the Egyptian army drown in ankle deep water? The second problem is that the absence of an archeological record does not mean the event did not occur. It would be like saying 1,000 years from now that I did not go to a particular resturant for dinner because there is no record. What is worse, in 1853, Dr. P. A. Stanley discovered six ancient, Aramic inscriptions on the cliffs of the Wadi Sidri in the Peninsula of Sinai .The inscriptions recorded the historical crossing of the Red Sea.(3) Another interesting archeological finding deals with the walls of Jericho. Again, critics of Christianity questioned the truth of the Bible because archeology had not discovered the city of Jericho. They doubted the existence of the city and the Biblical account that said the walls had fallen outward (Joshua 6). In 1930-1936, Professor John Garstang discovered the city of Jericho during an archeological dig (John Garstang, Joshua Judges, London: Constable, 1931). But the real finding was that the walls of the city were spread outward away from the city. That is, the walls had fallen outward just like the Bible said. This was a one-of-a-kind finding at an archeological dig. (4) Today, modern astronomy knows there are seven stars. The seventh star is very dim and can only be seen with telesecope. So modern translators can now put a name to the constellation – Pleiades. How did the Old Testament authors know there were seven stars in the Pleiades constellation?(5) In Job 26:7 it says that God hung the earth on nothing…The Hebrew word for “nothing” means nothingness or void. The earth is floating in a void. This is a remarkable statement since the scientists of the time and the religious beliefs of the time said the earth was carried on the shoulder of a mythogical god, rested on the back of elephant for example. How did the writer of Job know the earth hung in space, before science discovered this to be true? The Bible stated this as truth in 2,000 B.C.But none of this matters man, it’s what you believe that matters Don’t get your facts from revised, prejudiced views, just seek truth, you’ll find it.John RamirezHey ironfistatheist, didn’t He test Abraham, saved Abraham’s son from death?…HMMM? And doesn’t the Bible say that the wages of sin is death?…HMMM? Wasn’t the world at the time of Noah, full of sin, bringing about the flood as forewarned…..HMMM? You’re just another ignorant atheist or you purposely told only part of the truth just to prove a point that there is no god according to you and people who think like you. Sin is knowing to do right, but choosing to do wrong. And it is by the people’s choice that this world is messed up, not God’s choice. Jesus said, “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” God’s will is peace on earth. Their are people in this earth who want their own will to be done. They don’t want God’s will to be done….I know you have read the Bible or at least a part of the Bible that fits your needs at any particular time….Next time you choose to open up this most beautiful of books, ask yourself to find the wisdom to get something good out of it and you’ll find that it just won’t happen. Then, humble yourself before the Lord and ask for the wisdom and you will find that jesus was correct when He said, “Seek and you will find….”…..ironfistatheisti seek fact and they conclude answers. yes the fairytale states that an angel stopped abraham at the last second. my point is, why would a “god” even risk the life of an innocent son. i strongly feel that if someone told me to kill my son, i would exact such rage upon them they would wish they were never born. that being said, i have no kids and feel that way and parents that i have talked to make me feel like how i feel is mild compared to what they feel for the love of a child.mapsguy1955What is “true belief” in terms of religion? That sounds like an oxymoron to me. True has to be quantifiable, or in other words provable. There is NO religion whose beliefs can be proven absolutely.Don Skizentamapsguy, “true belief” in terms of religion is faith. Not to be confused with scientific fact. There is quite a difference between faith and provable fact as you see it. To compare them is to compare apples and oranges. They are both important, just for different things.Mark McAllisterI’ll go with that.mojoWhat really amazes me is that mohamad is mentioned 4 times in the quaran while Jesus is mentioned 25 times! There is one woman mentioned in the entire quaran, it’s Mary, the mother of Jesus. Isn’t that odd? You can trace the fued between jews and islamics back to jacob and esau…believe it or not, There are actually absolutes! There is a right and a wrong…There is a God…The whole problem with finding Him, is cutting through all the religions that have tried to own Him! It’s faith in the end! Choose wisely. Use the abilities that you posses, seeing, hearing etc…If you sincerely search, you will find…Good luck…in the mean time let’s protect each other from knife yielding morons and others that would strap bombs to children and push them onto crowded buses or schools, hospitals all the while promising them a great blessing with many, many virgins for comitting these hideous cowardly acts…Stu MacdonaldIslam and Judaism is an offshoot of Christianity…therefor there are numerous overlaps and shared references.onestillpatrioticStu MacDonald, Christianity is an offshoot of Judaism. Islam came some 400+ years after Christianity and was a pick-and-choose from both of them with a lotta mohammed added in, mix well and roll it out on the table like dice, and see what you get. It’s islam. He figured it out in a dark cave for 14 plus days, no food, no water, then a hallucination, and you have islam. I believe it to be a political system and then some.Stu MacdonaldOnestillpatriotic, I could very well be wrong…my memory of the details over the years has waned a bit. I think it is important to note the curiosity that mainstream religion shares the same roots. It would be interesting to make a comparison timeline of Judaism, Christianity and Islam based off the Hebrew Bible, Old and New Testament, and the Koran. I read some of Koran while deployed to Iraq, to help form a better understanding of the people, and there are numerous references to the Bible. Perhaps a project I might undertake in retirement…onestillpatrioticMojo, go back to the story of Abraham and Sarah. They were told at an old age that they’d have a son, and the wife scoffed at the idea. She convinced Abe that God needed help with the plan, so she tells him to sleep with her maid-servant to be sure it would happen. So Abe goes for it, she gets preggers, and Ishmael was born. Anyway, when Sarah saw that Ol’ Abe still had it, and the maid was flauntin’ it, she decided to go for it and eventually, Isaac was born. So Sarah runs the older half-brother off with his ma out into the desert to die. Go read the rest, and you’ll discover where the Arabs and Jews came from. The Arabs say that Abe is their father. The jews say that Abe is there father. Guess what, they’re both right. the only difference was the mothers involved. They’ve been at each other way longer than since mohammed was around. And make no mistake, they are in a spiritual war, it will continue.Doodaah!…and if we get bombed first, el stupido, who will you have to blame?? Rational humans??ironfistatheistwell if they bombed us i cannot blame anyone because i’d be dead… you can make hypotheticals all day long. what we need are solutionskeyway99I don’t trust atheist!!! They have no soul or say so, soulless people have no moral foundation. USSR and China tried to eradicate religion or insert the state as the religion, look how that turned out for the “people”. I suggest we gather all atheist together and start bombing them, see how long it takes to start calling out to God for help.gattacaaceScience has ways of proof.Religion is believing their is some dude in the sky.And religion has no proof other than centuries of war (becuase my god is better than your god).your gods help no one and offer no protection (if they did no women would get raped).put all of that information in your pipe and smoke it.Mark McAllisterFaith that heaven exists and that God will make all things right in the end is an easy and not entirely irrational argument against your assertion. You can do better.ironfistatheisthaha, there’s as much chance that i’d call to the flying spaghetti monster than to your god. and out of all the religions in the world, what makes you think you have the right one?and america wasn’t founded as a religious nation and we’re nothing like ussr or chinaMark McAllisterAnd look at how great things were going before the revolutions.gamesThere is only ONE God…the rest are gods.Rickrational humans? really? say you didnt say that.mojoAnother moron!

They wouldn’t ! They will not stop until they CONTROL everybody! Even the mildly mentally challenged ! Stop believing everything you are told by the controlled media! There is but one LIFEBOAT, feel free to lose the attitude (media induced reasoning, lumping isis is with any and every religious belief) and climb on in with the rest of us, like it or not, we will need each other before this is over…ironfistatheisti read from many different sources on a single topic to conclude my thoughts. if you had this ability you wouldn’t need faith in a book that contradicts itself constantly. think before you speak… or just think period… you might learn somethingjfover population is a myth. Yes cities are overcrowded, but there is a lot of open land, and not just farmland either. Farmers are paid not to grow, that is a Gov’t way to create a crisis so that they can assume more power and control. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, that goes for religious leaders and political ones too. Religion is not in itself evil, it is when you try to force your belief onto another. That goes for politics as well, take Al Gore and his global warming ploy, man-made global warming cannot be proven as an absolute fact therefore it cannot be an fact absolutely.ironfistatheistuhhh… then why do 90+% of scientist say that it is(and saying only 90% is being generous). open land is not the problem, it’s the finite resources.jfI can get a poll that says 90% of people think that the moon is made of cream cheese too… polls and stats are tailored to fit whatever your needs are.HeightsPersonReally? anyone who protests $cientology is a nut case? I think you are out of touch with reality and a waste of space.julea bacallAs are Multinational Corporations & their Militaries…like in Ukraine. Down with Take oversBenjamin HuttererNo such thing as a multinational corporation having its own military. However, the operators of any said corporation can request the help of the local government to enlist military assistance to protect their intellectual property. Take the gold mines for example. If the locals were upset and disrupted the distribution of gold from the mines, the corporate owner of said mines would put out a request to the local government to dampen the protest and get them out of the way so that the distributing trucks can get through and continue operations. It’s quite frustrating from a corporate standpoint, when the locals interfere with corporate progress for short-term profit.julea bacallThe Kiev Government Military is now OUR military and they call White House for instructions And Weapons. Also there are MANY private or special ops that are all for Corps and never just for Defense of our country….only their ‘interests’.

I was the same in my 20’s….amazing what you don’t know at that age.Raji the Green WitchDon’t be too hard on them, Kathleen. They don’t understand that everything is entirely a matter of perspective. THEY hang out with the younger generation, hence THAT is all they see and know. WE did the same thing when WE were that age. They too will mature and come to see things from a more balanced perspective. To be honest, I NEVER thought that MY views on things would evolve and change as I got more mature, either. So, cut them a little slack. It is nothing but the baggage of youth that is blinding them from the reality of things that exist around them.KathleenVery well said…FYI it’s LGBT ha ha. My niece would be hurt if I didn’t correct you. : )Raji the Green WitchLOL Kathleen. Again, it’s merely a matter of perspective (on your niece’s part).

Removing them will only give them more power and we will not be able to track/trace the enemy.Nic FWhy don’t you picket someone actually doing something wrong. If people wanna spend money for what they consider holy books they have every right. Do actually know anything about Scientology? The premise as a social science is actually brilliant. As a religion it’s a bit bizarre but so what? It’s called freedom of religion you fool and Scientologists are not burning down churches. Here are some actual quotes from the Jewish Talmud“Every Jew, who spills the blood of the godless (non-Jews), is doing the same as making a sacrifice to God.”– Talmud: Bammidber raba c 21 & Jalkut 772“The Jews are called human beings, but the non-Jews are not humans. They are beasts.”– Talmud: Baba mezia, 114b“Even though God created the non-Jew they are still animals in human form. It is not becoming for a Jew to be served by an animal. Therfore he will be served by animals in human form.”– Midrasch Talpioth, p. 255, Warsaw 1855Find me something from a scientology text that says anything anywhere near as evil as that. How about you picket an actual evil religion you moron?LolaSThe younger generation is fed up with the bullshit that is going on around us all. They see their future being destroyed by the greedy corporations, the religious fanatics, the inept and corrupt politicians. I love what they’re doing to show them all that they don’t have all the power against the rest of us.PuddintameKeep in mind that it was the B00m3rz that created the Internet. We were writing code to fit in 100kb workable games just for fun long before the Millennials were even born. Do you really think put away our PC’s and Servers for a Playstation.FUALL cults must be exterminated. They breed billions of stupid foolish people. Fairy-tale human looking gods wearing bedsheets, sandals, beards. You want to believe in death of the body & moving on to another dimension, no problem. That is enough. Imaginary bedsheet boys ar never needed. No more stupid foolish religions, no religion leaders dressed in fancy Hlloween costumes, no religion buildings, no religion leader created cult books.Doodaah!Shouldn’t the word be conscience? Anonymous has one! That a way to go…let us fund them so they can do their job, not just here, but, all over the world shutting ISIS down. Without social media they are thrust back into their own ‘dark’ ages. And when they stick their neck out of the dark…Let us “HEAD THEM OFF”, literally.truetolifeYou really needed anyone to inform you that scientology is a CULT? Really, how simple minded are you?Most all religions are cults. They prosper because people are FOLLOWERS. Anonymous as a group are a leader. They look past all of the superficial garbage and see individuals with rights and purpose. Please, mature to teh point where you think for yourself.Thumper VonnIt would be “a social conscience.” Or you could say “is socially conscious” but that doesn’t really convey much. Or you could say “is socially conscientious.”rbrittneYeah thank you Anon….and also thank you for sticking up for individual 2nd amendment rights! Self defense is a God given right and owing guns is gauranteed by the 2nd amendment.RickI suppose stopping ISIS from every angle is what is needed. It is amazing how much violence is in our world. And very concerning that in mexico very similar acts of murder are happening daily. That’s not very far from the peace and tranquility of where I live. Not very far at all. One war is based on religion and another on drugs. At the end of the day does it really matter why some one was murdered chopped up into pieces and set on fire ? Is there some sort of mental plague that’s taking over the world right now? Is there some sort of electronic technology high frequency subliminal influences that are causing many many people to slaughter many others ? Whats going on exactly? Boko Haram is on a killing spree, Mexican drug cartels are on a killing spree. Assad is on a killing spree. ISIS is on a killing spree. Al Qaeda all over the place is on a killing spree. Israel is on a killing spree. Who am I leaving out ? I mean, is this a world war we are looking at ?steveThe world is always at war. Its just more vocal now with the internet and advanced communications of the world today. Not sure where it started, but it seems war is ingrained into our DNA.creekhunter .The violence started in Hollywood to male us numb to it . Now its not that big a deal to most people. Most sane nations would keep people from violent nations out of their country but Nooo we invite people from violent nations to come live with us.Patrick Josephcreekhunter, blaming Hollywood for the atrocities being committed is irresponsible and dumb. America is a free country – Americans do not invite violent people or nations to come live with us. Get a grip!fedupWell, obama does invite them.Tell you laterKeep on making shit up, fedup, and you will always be fed up.fedupOH REALLY there obama azz kisser….He invited the Muslim Brotherhood into the White House! They are a terrorist group! Members of his administration ARE also members of the brotherhood!TroyRemove lips from Obama’s ass and maybe, just maybe, you’ll be able to think clearly.creekhunter .I didn’t say the atrocities are caused by Hollywood, I said we are numb to it now and watching violence on tv has something but not all to do with it. You are truly blind to the fact that the kind of people that come here now are from very violent nations, its part of their culture.InvisibleZombie“Hollywood” or I assume you mean the modern movie business is just about 100 years old, far less if you exclude the formative years. So it can’t be the blame for tens of thousands of years of violence and war and slaughter in human history. Is it so hard to accept that this is a basic part of human nature? Yeah, it sucks, but as soon as we acknowledge that and stop “blaming”, the better we can deal with it.RickI read a book if i remember it was called finger prints or foot prints of the gods. It described over thousands of years of our own evolution that these white bearded men would emerge from the sea. And would civilize humans, teach them things. Then they would vanish. thousands of years would go by and these white bearded men would show up again, from the sea. Teach humans a little more and vanish again. Like some other race would intervene right before we were going to destroy ourselves completely. I have no Idea true or untrue. All I know is i think we are over due for a visit from these bearded guys from the sea.Jm MaceyerollRickEggroll. no I don’t think they brought eggrolls.dreamhelmetVikings?!RickNo. They had powers the locals of that time didn’t possess. But thru out history they showed up. Some advanced race. they didn’t bring death and destruction with them. They taught people how to live peacefully with each other. Among other advanced things.I guess you gotta be above the caveman IQ. To accept some one more evolved then humans.TroyYou better get cracking then, you have a long ways to go before you move beyond cave man status in the intelligence dept.TroyPut the meth down and step away. It’s addled your brain quite a bit.RickFunny guy. I will agree that reading does some thing to the brain. But of course you wouldn’t understand.Highlowsel SmithRick: No. It’s not a world war. It’s a world breaking down into chaos and anarchy. The baser aspect of the human chimp is loose, afoot in the world….or as the poet Yeats said:“Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned. The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.”He wrote this in the early part of the 20th Century. I’d say he wasn’t far off in describing today’s 21st Century world, eh?So it goes.Highlow American Net’ZenJames CluckeyEven with those killing sprees the world is actually much safer than it was in the past. Much less people actually die due to war or crimes. You just hear about them more due to the internet.James WherryInteresting fact: prior to our invasion into Afghanistan, the average life expectancy in Afghanistan was 44 years old. Today, it is 61 years old, despite continuing violence. That’s 17 years in only a decade or, if you want to multiply that by the population, that’s 527 million years of human life.I believe RedCult Team is just taking the credit. You can tell by the dates.Hu DatNow obammy will have a hissy fit about his fellow terrorists being deprived of their right to recruit terroriststerencewYou guys are idiots.

That racism ploy just doesn’t work anymore. People like you are the problem, seeing racism where there is none to try to get Obama haters to back down. Obama is a poisonous snake unleashed on America by low information voters who couldn’t find their butts with both hands and think they need “help” from the government. I am tired of working my tail off to pay the taxes that fund the “lifestyle” of the 47%.James CluckeyIt’s funny there is so much hate for Obama. While under his presidency the economy is actually better than when he took office. It has finally rebounded from Bush’s presidency that screwed it all to hell.JoeNo its not. More people have dropped from the workforce and Obama’s policies have hindered more than helped what little recovery has been measured.HeightsPersonYou are also working your butt off to support the lifestyles of the 1 percenters.

Brian Williams was probably there and can tell you what Obama’s role wasDrewHis role was to take a risk that would violate another country’s sovereignty, or in another way of saying, he would have committed political suicide if he were wrong.James CluckeyIt was his order.

If we wait for the Govt. to do something it will never happen!SHGovernment can’t really help it . . . cyber attacks are a relatively new aspect that little on the planet can control. Internet is like food these days, you need it . . . but if you abuse it for doing something in reality, it’s groups like Anon that will put you back in your place. Can’t really call them vigilantes because there are so few laws/regulations for things on the internet. Granted, some of what they do is considered illegal, but at the same time it’s beyond useful for tracking/stopping potential terrorists from communicating. In this age, not having communication is pretty much a death sentence.HappyBD!!QueenB!!oh so NSA that has been stealing all your data sonce 9/11 can do anything lolIndependent ObserverSad thing is the good intentions of this group are just interfering with signal intelligence activities, but you have to admire their intentions.john Baldwinsure you can stop hacking, you simple put the code in a plug in device that becomes the key to decoding the data on a network. No key No access . As long as the key is in the software it can always be hacked. The answer is put the key on a portable plug in device not in the software.SHAnd what are you going to do if the plug gets hacked? Blizzard Entertainment uses a authenticator, but all someone has to do is figure out the code setup and those can be cracked. It can be done, but it’s not very plausible or practical to do so (depending on the data being stored).TiredMemeCatYea, knock them off Twitter; that will destroy their organization. /sThe most powerful tool would be MSM across the globe agreeing not only to never show their horrors, but to stop talking about them, period. This goes for politicians too. The oxygen that sustains them is attention. Stop paying them any.James WherryTired: no, I’m afraid I have to disagree. I want their evil to get out because I want it exposed. Only when it is fully exposed can people stop lying to themselves and realize this is a real danger. Witness Jordan.Highlowsel SmithJames: I get what you’re saying but…really….exposure to date (for ISIS) has lead to what, exactly? Only to decapitations and death by burning about which the global community knows. This is enough. We don’t need to know more. We can see them for what they are; evil incarnate. For lack of a better word, demons. By their actions they stand revealed as such. And as such they need to be simultaneously muzzled/censored and crushed. There is no other way than this, so the rest of us should simply get on with it. Put them down. Quickly and with as much ruthless, merciless, efficiency as they have done to their murdered victims. And from my point of view whenever possible their bodies should then be chummed – unnamed in death – and fed to pigs. Then forgotten. They deserve no less….Highlow American Net’ZenKenAgree with most of your sentiment except the part about exposure. If the world is left in the dark no action will be taken, it has to be exposed to FORCE action. Your correlation between exposure and the atrocities is incorrect. Decapitations, crucifixion, rape and other atrocities have been part of islam since it began so this is nothing new to TV and internet.James WherryHighlow, I think there’s a disagreement about cause and effect: the exposure isn’t leading to their evil actions – others are not emulating them. I don’t see copycat immolations, only a recoiling from horror as a young man is brutally murdered. al-Shebaab, al-Quaeda and Boko Harem, their “siblings in terror” all have their own modus decimandi.I agree with Fareed Zakaria, this morning: the immolation was “an act of desperation” by a group that is rapidly running out of fighters, arms and territory. I was pleased to realize that the Kurds are now dug in around Mosul and prepared to take it, with the Iraqi Army.My one regret with that operation is that I am familiar with the Sun’ni and Shi’a splits: I’ve served in Iraq twice. The second time I served in Kirkuk and Mosul. The Sun’ni’s do not want to go back to being dominated, abused and murdered by the Shi’ite security forces in Iraq or Syria, and no one gets that. There appears to be no plan for “the day after victory,” only propaganda that “Sun’ni Muslims now see how bad ISIS is, so they want back into Iraq.” That’s a half truth, at best.SusanK6461Thank you James Wherry, for your informed opinion, a rarity I’m sad to say. Know that you have my undying gratitude for your service to our country as well.fedupWell, they are revealed to everyone but obama…he still thinks they are the JV team and that the christian crusaders are more of a threat.James WherryI’d have to say that there were horrible things done in the name of Christianity, and not simply by Crusaders. The Protestant Leader and founder of the Presbyterian Church, John Calvin had Michael servetus tried for heresy when he denied the trinity – upon conviction, Servetus was burnt at the stake. Seems like that’s what ISIS did.But the Crusaders and Calvin lived a long time ago, and I’m far more worried about what is happening today, and today Christianity is uniform in condemning these atrocities. Muslims have not been, or at least not unless it is condemning the mistreatment of a fellow Muslim.Mary JOne cannot ignore history without repeating it. Our reliance on TV news for the “truth” leaves us vulnerable to the opinions and bias that are part of that. The media reports on tragedy, violence and fanaticism. It focuses on fear, anger, and prejudice. The zealot believes his/her actions are righteous. We are all indoctrinated by the religion we are born to. Few seem able to distinguish the illogic in their beliefs. Far more ignore or deny facts that undermine their beliefs. It appears to me that Christians are intent on bringing about hell on earth so the Second Coming can begin. That they and their families might be caught up in the suffering doesn’t seem to occur to them.James WherryMary, you are partlly correct. There most certainly are Christians in the United States who are “hell bent” on turning our own nation into a theocracy. I’m gay, so I deal with them, every day. They look with glee for the Second Coming of Christ, but when I see them, I am DEAD CERTAIN that they would regret the experience.As for me, I used to be horribly interested in eschatology, but I spoke with a moderate minister, once, who told me, “Jim, there are Christians who live in the past and say, ‘Oh, for the Good Old Days. We used to have revivials…’ and then there are Christians who live in the future and say, ‘Just you wait: God is going to work a great miracle!’ For me, I’ve learned to live in the present and I assume that, if I do right by God and my fellow man, I’ll be ready when He shows up.” I liked his opinion.Tell you laterThis kind of complete fact/statement reversal is what coalesces the vermin among us into the Rethuglicunt Party.TroyBetter than kissing liberal ass.Nina DiI am not worried about Isis, i scared of child molesters, they are cockroaches that society does not want to get rid of. Especially in America, its so bad, they had a t.v. show, “To Catch a Predator”, work on eliminating that!umpleasedontkillmeWe would do that to the pigs???Arlene PetersI agree with both you and Wherry, for if you want done to ISIS, what they have done to others, how will it be known what to do to them, if what they do, is NOT exposed.? Plus on the other hand some people who do not see it will not believe it. I feel that news about what they do must be brought to the attention of people so they will know it is true, and yet I do realize that the attention the media is giving them is working for them. Seems like a no win situation as to report or not to report about these horrible happenings.mudslideEliminate them and their exposure ceases to exist…deltalady1946I think you are both correct….just to different degrees. The video of the Jordanian pilot, however, is something I wish they had not posted on the web. But that’s just my opinion….since it has very nicely backfired on these POS terrorists, no regrets then.James WherryI’ve never seen the video, only still shots. I think that would have been more than enough.Arlene PetersI agree about the video, I did not watch it either but knowing that it is there for non-believers to see is enough, but yes, the still shots were enough for me.denver41so you are a moron. If they are on twitter and on facebook trying to recruit in other countries…how does that happen if they cant be found. dont be stupid.endo_alleyThe best tool would be to lay siege to any city taken by ISIS. Nothing comes in. Nothing leaves. No food. No water. No power or fuel. Could be done by the air. Starve ‘m.KenSad to see people agreeing with you. In the world of slow media and no television islam was still as barbaric and disgusting as it it today and was allowed to fester and spread like a disease. The only times it has been slowed and turned back is when people were informed and decided to do something about it.Try actually learning about history and reading the quran. Seems more like you are projecting your own PC bias instead of dealing with reality.johnYou are the one that is ignorant susanThe WaderSusan, You do not know what you are talking about.TruthIslam is a disease that needs eradicated.Capt Jack ObviousSpirituality and religion are what they are. Using any force for self-gain, and damnation of others is the definition of barbarism. The only country to attain the vaunted title of non-barbarian from the 20th forward? Japan, that is until they repealed the portion of their Constitution about reining in a war machine, so yea they rejoined the rest of the barbaric world.Sean SopataUh, I have serious issues if the media were to stop reporting on it. Censorship at it’s absolute worst. Their job is to report news. This is news. Like it or not. Pretending it isn’t happening isn’t a solution.fedupYes, their job is to report ALL news, but not to make up news and nit pick that which they want.Marta WellerAll news, huh? There is not enough paper in the world to print all the news. The internet would very likely come to a screaming halt, should they try to make all the news available to all the world. You would get burned out by the sheer volume. There are how many billions of people on this planet? That’s a lot of news! And it would it would never stop as long as there is human life here. We pick and choose what we want to read or watch, and editors have edited the news since the invention of the printing press and audio and video media. Personally, I wish they would stop printing and posting crap about celebs and celeb wannabees. I am so sick of the Kardashians, the Jenners. and the bloody, irrelevant British Royal family. The cult of celebrity is way out of control in the industrialized world. But there are people that waste their time with this drivel, and I do believe in freedom of speech, so I guess I’ll just have to wade through the useless clutter.Marta WellerThat’s exactly what the Germans did, and to an extent, what the allies did during the holocaust. And who spoke up for the people of the Ukraine and the Jews in the USSR when Stalin slaughtered or starved millions of them. He made Hitler look like an amateur.JimThe reality of their horrors needs to be seen. If it wasn’t we would continue to say Islam is the religion of peace, and allow anyone to call themselves Islamic to be considered peaceful.GeoWesKnowledge is the enemy of those who would enslave.
