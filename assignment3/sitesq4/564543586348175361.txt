Vermont's independent Sen. Bernie Sander is set to announce a presidential campaign Thursday, according to reports.While the senator will attempt to appeal to voters by touting his staunchly-left record, Sanders has something else on his resume that might stand out to voters: comedy actor.Sanders played "Rabbi Manny Shevitz" in the 1999 low-budget comedy My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception. Sanders, who appears in the trailer, makes an appearance for about two minutes midway through the movie.My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception is a "laugh out loud" film full of all things we love and hate about weddings. A slice of life film that shows us what really happens on the most important days in some of our lives. Whether you wish to follow the love triangle between the bride, groom and ex-boyfriend or see what the bridesmaids really talk about in the powder room; this is the movie for you. Take a peek into a Jewish-Italian wedding as the families and their guests show us what we are all thinking yet never say at these events. Regardless of your heritage, you will find at least one character and one sup plot you can relate to and it might make you think for a bit before getting married.In the film, Sanders, who grew up in Brooklyn in real life, talks about growing up watching the Brooklyn Dodgers and drags on talking about baseball.WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court justices showed deep division Wednesday on the use of a sedative drug, midazolam, in executions — from accusations that death penalty opponents are engaged in "guerrilla" warfare to a pointed attack on whether Oklahoma's lawyer could be trusted.In arguments that included repeated discussion of the since-discontinued practice of burning people at the stake, the ultimate outcome of the case before the court — a challenge by Oklahoma inmates to the use of midazolam in the state's execution protocol — was anyone's guess.The court returned to the question of the constitutionality of lethal injection drugs in the wake of several problematic executions in which the new drug, midazolam, was used.In Ohio, Oklahoma, and Arizona, multiple executions involving midazolam resulted in the execution taking longer than expected and reports that the person being executed either was still moving or otherwise showed signs of remaining conscious.In Oklahoma, the botched execution of Clayton Lockett a year ago today led the governor there, Mary Fallin, to order a review of the state's protocol.Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key vote in the case, was mostly quiet throughout the arguments — asking only one question about whether the court should consider the fact that midazolam is only in use due to the "unavailability" of other drugs, whose effect is more well-known, because of the efforts of death penalty "abolitionist[s]."That comment followed questioning by Justices Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia about what Alito called the "guerrilla war against the death penalty" by death penalty opponents, whose efforts are "reducing access to drugs."The arguments, which Chief Justice John Roberts extended by an extra five minutes per side, focused primarily on tough questions posed by Roberts, Scalia, and Alito to Robin Konrad, who represented the inmates, and even more tough — and at times, accusatory — questions to Oklahoma Solicitor General Patrick Wyrick from Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.At one point in Wyrick's argument in defense of the use of the drug, Sotomayor, essentially, told the state's lawyer that he had lied in his briefs before the court."I am substantially disturbed that you made several statements in the briefs that weren't true," she told him. "Nothing you say am I going to believe, frankly, without checking the context" — noting that she would have to see it with "[her] own eyes."Sotomayor was then given wide berth by her colleagues to go into detail to question him regarding some of those examples, from the state's characterization of the Food and Drug Administration's description of the drug to its characterization of one of the studies about the drug on which the state relied.“There will be more police on the street, a hundred thousand more police officers, with flexibility given to local communities to determine how best to use them.”Associated PressFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Wednesday for ending "the era of mass incarceration." Clinton's remarks, as noted by many in the media, specifically reject the "tough-on-crime" mantra and legislation advocated by her husband during his time as president.The shift in rhetoric and policy around criminal justice issues has been significant over the last two decades. In fact, 21 years ago, Hillary Clinton as first lady spoke to a conference for female police officers where he pushed her husband's agenda in New York.At the time, Clinton said the 1994 crime bill — which called for 100,000 more police officers, more prisons, and harsher sentencing for crimes, and enacted stricter gun laws — would "make a difference in your lives as police officers and in the lives of the communities you serve.""We will be able to say, loudly and clearly, that for repeat, violent, criminal offenders — three strikes and you're out. We are tired of putting you back in through the revolving door," remarked the then-first lady.Clinton also noted that the crime bill would help build more prisons."We will also finally understand that fighting crime is not just a question of punishment, although there are many dollars in the crime bill to build more prisons," she said. "It is also a question of prevention. We want to give police officers the tools to help young people stay out of trouble. We want to begin to give young people something to say yes to, not just to have to face the bleak, alienated streets that too often push them in the wrong direction."On Wednesday, Clinton talked about how the United States "almost 25% of the world's prison population," called for police to be equipped with body cameras, and discussed the issues of substance abuse and mental health. The remarks come as during protests and riots in Baltimore after the death of 25-year-old black man who died from injuries received while in police custody.The sad truth is that, unfortunately, there are those who would rather talk about fighting crime than actually give you the tools that you can use to fight crime. And what we have to do, those of us in civilian life, is to stand up and support those of you who are on the front line. Because this crime bill will make a difference in your lives as police officers and in the lives of the communities you serve.There will be more police on the street, a hundred thousand more police officers, with flexibility given to local communities to determine how best to use them. We will be able to say, loudly and clearly, that for repeat, violent, criminal offenders -- three strikes and you're out. We are tired of putting you back in through the revolving door.We will also finally understand that fighting crime is not just a question of punishment, although there are many dollars in the crime bill to build more prisons. It is also a question of prevention. We want to give police officers the tools to help young people stay out of trouble. We want to begin to give young people something to say yes to, not just to have to face the bleak, alienated streets that too often push them in the wrong direction.And also in this crime bill is something that goes along with the domestic violence initiative. For the first time, there is a special section that focuses on violence against women. And understand that there are special problems that go along with domestic violence and other crimes committed against women.So all in all, this crime bill tries to take a bottoms-up approach, because it is built on the experience of people who have actually been there, people like yourselves.Scocking Video!Warning: My be extremely offensive for some viewers, not intended for minors, must be over 18 to view, by proceeding to view video you acknowledge you are of legal age and understand this may be offensive.
