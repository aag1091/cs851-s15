In comments published by Arsenal’s official website, the Frenchman said, “It’s worrying that at the back, with five minutes to go, we are always there ready to make the same mistakes.”The fact that Wenger highlighted recurring problems could be a worry for Arsenal’s current centre-back pairing of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker – or more precisely for one of them.With Nacho Monreal impressing at left-back and Hector Bellerin a promising prospect on the opposite flank, it is Arsenal’s experienced duo who must up their game or risk seeing a sustained spell on the bench.The 24-year-old has spent the last two Premier League matches as an unused substitute, but if Wenger wants to put an end to those “same mistakes” it would be no surprise if Gabriel was used sooner rather than later.He has played 50 times for Villarreal and 77 times for Esporte Clube Vitoria so he has plenty of experience, and talent aplenty to excel in Arsenal’s first XI.Only time will tell, but with Wenger citing repeating factors as a cause for frustration, there is now an answer he may choose not to ignore.Would you like to see Gabriel start for Arsenal?Vincent RalphAfter graduating with a degree in English Literature, Vincent completed a NCTJ-accredited qualification in newspaper and magazine journalism in 2005.
