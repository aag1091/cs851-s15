Today, Joe Belfiore from Microsoft confirmed that Windows 10 phones will be coming to 512 MB devices including the most popular Lumia 520. But the main thing to note here is that all features of Windows 10 for phones may not be supported by 512mb devices. I hope Windows 10 universal development platform will be supported in devices like Lumia 520.Timing for various phones may be variable as well. When we first launch insider program, itâ€™ll be a subset of phones with more coming latrHe also revealed that when Windows Insider program for phones will be launched later this month, only a subset of devices will be supported. Microsoft will be supporting only a subset of devices initially because it is easier to manage until the build matures enough for wider release.He tweeted that internal testing is still going on and they will be releasing it to the public in February as announced in January event. Going by his tweet, I guess we will get Windows 10 for phones in the third week for February.
