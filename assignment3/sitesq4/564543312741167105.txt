After ‘double whammy,’ Mount Royal University faculty plan to speak out against Alberta funding cutsShare this ArticleJennifer Friesen / For Metro The "main street" of Mount Royal University is seen.The budgetary axe may yet fall again on Alberta’s post-secondary sector, but faculty at one city institution appear unwilling to take further funding cuts lying down.Mount Royal University arguably took it on the chin hardest in 2013 when the provincial grants fell more than nine per cent short of what had been promised. The school had previously not been provided with proper funding to support new bachelor degrees in introduced when converting from a college to university in 2009.“Mount Royal has lived through a double whammy of funding cuts and broken promises over the last five or six years and we’re running very lean,” explained Marc Schroeder, president of the campus faculty association. “There’s widespread believe among faculty that there’s really nowhere left where we can cut.”But indications are that Schroeder’s school and others won’t see a boost in funding in 2015 and may very well be saddled with another cut.MRU administrators confirmed Wednesday that “top-level” budget scenarios being mapped out at the school account for anywhere from a zero to five per cent cut in the spring budget. Fellow institution the University of Calgary is also planning for cuts that are potentially that deep while a note from the University of Lethbridge indicates they believe the reductions could go as deep as eight per cent.But Mount Royal faculty are now hosting five days of events on campus next week to get the message out the importance of post-secondary. It’s likely the first “advocacy week” staged at the school and will include classroom discussions, letter-writing parties and panel discussions featuring senior officials and others within the Mount Royal community.Roberta Lexier, who chairs the faculty association’s advocacy committee, agreed with her peer that “there’s no more fat to trim,” but said, for some reason, she doesn’t believe the post-secondary sector is given as much consideration among provincial treasury representatives when it comes time to make tough decisions.“There’s a sense that the government can cut post-secondary because people aren’t putting pressure on them to ensure that they don’t . . . I think at Mount Royal we’ve been trying to combat a lot of that,” she said. In the wake of the 2013 cuts, hundreds from the university’s community marched in protest to the nearby constituency office of then-premier Alison Redford.In an email Wednesday, Duane Anderson, Mount Royal’s vice-president of administrative services, said the scenarios being worked through align with those of peer institutions, but cautioned that “we have not yet narrowed our focus on any single budgetary assumption.”For more information about Mount Royal University’s advocacy week, which begins Monday, email Lexier at rlexier@mtroyal.ca.
