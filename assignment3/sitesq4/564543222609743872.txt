We serve with excellence and equality with our community to progress towards a better tomorrow.How long have you been doing peace in the hood and what made you want to start something like this?Actually, I just started this initiative as I was on the bus back from a 3-day conference with other Dream Defenders in Orlando, FL . My younger brother, who was in town on winter break from Valencia College had called me and said that there was a shooting, literally down the street from the house at Arcola Park where 9 young men under the age of 18 were shot and at that time I just felt inclined to act.Was there one specific moment in your life which made you want to start something like this for the community?Besides listening to Tupac religiously, I think it was just growing up in Liberty City, hearing old stories of Overtown and being told stories about how Liberty City was once called Model City is what molded me to be the man I am today to stay focused and discipline on the task at hand.After the open forum and discussion about problems in inner cities what kind of resolution are you looking to gain with peace in the hood?The overall objective is to engage the community at large to address OUR problems and together as a community come up with solutions as to how WE can make the environment better based on OUR needs, wants and resources because WE all are active participants in our local economy good or bad.Right here I would like you to talk about some of the biggest problems facing Miami right now as it relates to peace in the hood.As it relates to true #PeaceInTheHood, first, I believe as community organizations we must show the people through our actions more unity because our PERSONAL differences have made us ineffective in the fight against our COLLECTIVE struggle. Which, subsequently, makes us inadequate in disseminating information to the people. Second, we must address the stigmas through research that have plagued and defined the people who live in inner city communities such as “black on black crime,” “why we’re unemployed,” and “why we live in poverty.” Lastly, just some food for thought, we must truly ask ourselves what is “white privilege”? Is it not a competitive advantage economically? What opportunities were they given with OUR sacrifice?
