IN FOCUSDANS LA MIREPortsToronto's Outer Harbour Marina Boat Launch BeginsIn preparation for the 2015 boating season, PortsToronto’s Outer Harbour Marina (OHM) has begun its annual boat launch. The annual boat launch involves moving 600 boats from their winter storage location on land and placing the boats back in the water at the Marina using a 50-tonne travel lift. The first boat launched this year was “REEL MISS GYPSY” a 42-ft Searay Powerboat. On average 12 to 15 boats per day will be placed back in the water by May 30.Located just ten minutes from Toronto’s downtown core, the OHM is one of the largest freshwater Marinas in Ontario with more than 650 slips, many of which can accommodate pleasure craft up to 100-feet long making it the only docking facility of its kind in Toronto. In addition, the OHM is the only Marina in the Greater Toronto Area with heated indoor winter boat storage.A recently constructed BBQ Pavilion at the OHM provides boaters and their guests with a central, sheltered location to cook up lunch or dinner, while entertaining with breathtaking views of the city and Marina. A new Marina store, which will open this May, will offer boaters convenient, on-site access to snacks, refreshments and boating accessories. High speed fuel pumps, free parking for vehicles and a number of other best-in-class amenities and services, such as free WiFi, complete the marina experience.For the past five years, the OHM has earned a 5 Green Anchor Gold rating from the Ontario Marine Operators’ Association as part of the Clean Marine environmental certification program—one of the highest rankings a marina can attain for following environmental best practices.
