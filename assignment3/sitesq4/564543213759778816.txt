NCRI Iran NewsVIDEO - ISJ: Camp Liberty residents ‘disarmed by US’ have right to self-defenseNCRI - Iranian opposition activists in Camp Liberty were disarmed by the US but are under threat of attack and have a right to self-defense, the president of the International Committee in Search of Justice has demanded.Alejo Vidal-Quadras, the president of prominent Non-Governmental Organization told a conference in Paris: "The residents of Camp Liberty and Camp Ashraf have right to self-defense."They have been massacred in several attacks since the security of the sites were transferred to Iraqi authorities under the control of the Iranian regime."They were massacred because they were disarmed by the US forces and now they are defenseless in front of attacks that can murder them any moment at leisure."It is then essential that if the US and the UN and the international community do not ensure their protection their personal weapon should be returned to them in order to prevent new attacks or in case of a new attack they can exercise their legitimate right of self-defense."Not to do so, it is equivalent to collaborate with the crimes of the Iranian regime. Either we protect them or we let them to defend themselves. As clear as that."
