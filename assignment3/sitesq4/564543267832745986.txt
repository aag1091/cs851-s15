NavigationWays to Deal with the Loss of Your Pet# Give Yourself Time to GrieveDon’t pay attention to those who are unable to understand your loss and make comments such as “It’s only a pet.” Everyone is entitled to his or her beliefs, so simply stand up and leave the room if they persist in ridiculing your situation. Allow yourself to feel whatever emotions come to you directly after your loss. Remind yourself that this stage will always be the hardest.
