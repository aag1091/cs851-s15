Jurassic World (2015) Super Bowl TV SpotJurassic World (2015) - Super Bowl TV SpotType: TV SpotsDuration:1M10SUniversal Pictures just released the special Super Bowl TV Spot for Colin Trevorrow‘s Jurassic World (2015). This TV spot shows very little as in additional footage but there are a small few. Definitely a more polished TV spot so check it out for yourself. Starring in Jurassic World are Chris Pratt, Judy Greer and Ty Simpkins.Synopsis: Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park (1993), Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. After 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfill a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitor’s interest, which backfires horribly.Support Hell Horror by sharing our articles and following us on Facebook/Twitter/Google+/Pinterest:
