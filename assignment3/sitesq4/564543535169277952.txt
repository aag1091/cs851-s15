(more)For 2014 PQRS eCQMs, the expectation is that eligible professionals (EPs) or group practices reporting via the Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) select 9 measures and 3 domains applicable to their practice, or report on as many measures and domains as they have available (up to 9 measures/3 domains) within their CEHRT EHR and with applicable Medicare patient data. If more than 9 measures are applicable, then EPs/group practices can select the 9 most appropriate for their practice (or can report on as many applicable measures over 9 as desired).EPs/group practices can earn a 2014 PQRS incentive and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment by meeting the following criteria for satisfactory reporting:1. Using a direct EHR product that is Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) or EHR data submission vendor that is CEHRT, report on at least 9 measures covering 3 National Quality Strategy (NQS) domains. If the EPs CEHRT does not contain patient data for at least 9 measures covering at least 3 domains, then the EP must report the measures for which there is Medicare patient data. An EP must report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data to earn the 2014 PQRS incentive and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment.The 0% performance rate rule, where no patients in the denominator are in compliance and/or receive the correct quality action rule, does not apply to 2014 PQRS eCQMs. However, EPs should be aware that the VBM program, performance on eCQMs will be included when calculating the VBM. An EP must report on at least 1 measure with Medicare patient data meeting the denominator criteria, but the one patient does not need to meet numerator criteria.Note: This rule is not applicable to groups reporting via GPRO web interface. Those groups must report all 22 GPRO WI measures both to earn a 2014 incentive and to avoid the 2016 payment adjustment.If an EP/group practice has no applicable eCQMs with Medicare data, (s)he should choose a different reporting option for 2014 PQRS.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions.

(more)Beginning in 2015, CMS will subject eligible professionals who are not successful reporters under Physician Quality Reporting to a payment adjustment. To avoid the 2015 Physician Quality Reporting payment adjustment, eligible professionals must successfully report during the 2013 reporting period (January 1, 2013  December 31, 2013).If subject to the 2015 Physician Quality Reporting payment adjustment, eligible professionals will be paid 1.5% less than the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) amount for services rendered in 2015. In 2016 and each subsequent year, the payment adjustment increases to 2.0%. The payment adjustment will be applied to all of the eligible professional's Part B-covered professional services under the Medicare PFS.Additional information about how to avoid the Physician Quality Reporting System payment adjustment is available on CMS website.

Use the measure specifications to identify measures applicable for professional services you routinely provide. 2). Select those measures that make sense based upon prevalence and volume in your practice as well as your individual or practice performance analysis and improvement priorities. 3). Review the measures that you have selected to become familiar with how to apply and correctly code the measures. 4). Refer to the Physician Quality Reporting System Implementation Guide for more detailed information and reporting tips at http://www.cms.gov/PQRS/15_MeasuresCodes.asp. 5). Access data collection worksheets on the American Medical Association's (AMA) website (http://www.ama-assn.org/ama) to help you implement Physician Quality Reporting in your practice. 6) Ensure that your billing software and clearinghouse can correctly submit Physician Quality Reporting quality-data codes (QDCs) on your behalf to the carrier. 7) Regularly review the Remittance Advice Notice you receive from the Carrier/Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) to ensure the denial remark code N365 is listed for each QDC submitted.MAV is a validation process that will determine whether individual eligible professionals (EPs) or group practices sh... (more)MAV is a validation process that will determine whether individual eligible professionals (EPs) or group practices should have reported additional measures OR additional domains. MAV determines 2014 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) incentive eligibility and 2016 PQRS payment adjustment status for individual EPs and group practices. In the instance an individual EP or group practice has satisfactorily reported nine or more measures across three or more domains, MAV would not apply and the individual EP or group practice could earn the 2014 PQRS incentive and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment.MAV is applied to individual EPs and group practices that report less than nine measures OR less than three domains for PQRS. If MAV analytically determines that the EP or group practice could have reported additional measures or domains within the clinical cluster, then the 2014 PQRS incentive would not be earned and the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment may apply. Claims-based MAV is applicable to individual EPs, whereas registry-based MAV is applicable to individual EPs and group practices.Please contact the QualityNet help desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via the new e-mail address at qnetsupport@hcqis.org should you have any additional questions.EPs and group practices are not required to have 2014 CEHRT for the full year of PQRS or have 2014 CEHRT implemented ... (more)EPs and group practices are not required to have 2014 CEHRT for the full year of PQRS or have 2014 CEHRT implemented on the first day of the reporting year, which is 1/1/2014. However, in order to participate in PQRS via an EHR-based reporting mechanism, EPs and group practices must submit the final set of data utilizing 2014 CEHRT. The EP or group practice will only be able to participate in 2014 PQRS if the new TIN implements 2014 CEHRT in time for submission. Therefore, EPs and group practices in this scenario will have access to a full year of data via 2014 CEHRT and will be able to participate in both the 2014 EHR Incentive Program and PQRS via EHR reporting method.Please note that group practices participating in 2014 PQRS through the group practice reporting option (GPRO) via Web Interface are also required to use 2014 CEHRT to populate the Web Interface when participating in 2014 PQRS and the EHR Incentive Program.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions. They are available from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. CST Monday through Friday.If the eligible professional (EP) reporting as an individual PQRS reporter (and not part of a group practice using the Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO)) achieves satisfactory reporting under more than one reporting option, the EP will receive the incentive payment for the most advantageous reporting method for which he/she qualifies. There is no penalty if multiple options are attempted. CMS will review data submitted via one or more reporting methods to determine satisfactory reporting and eligibility for an incentive payment of a percentage of the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) total estimated allowed charges during the reporting period.For those reporting as individual PQRS reporters using the registry submission method, it is acceptable to use multiple registries within the same reporting year to submit PQRS data, even for the same measures. Data analysis will determine if satisfactory reporting was achieved for each registry in which the individual EP within the TIN participated, and the most favorable outcome will be used (but results from multiple vendors will not be combined). Submitting PQRS data to several registries may increase the EPs chance of satisfactory reporting, in case one registry was not successful (the same applies to EHR-based reporting using Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT).However, a group practice reporting via GPRO using a registry must submit for the group through one registry.EPs who are providers/suppliers in ACO participant TINs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (SSP) may NOT earn a PQRS incentive/avoid the payment adjustment outside of their ACO reporting, per SSP regulation.If reporting for PQRS through another CMS program (such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program, Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations), please check the programs requirements for information on how to report quality data to earn a PQRS incentive and/or avoid the PQRS payment adjustment. Please note, although CMS has attempted to align or adopt similar reporting requirements across programs, eligible professionals should look to the respective quality program to ensure they satisfy the PQRS, EHR Incentive Program, Value-Based Payment Modifier (VBM), etc. requirements of each of these programs.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions.

(more)Physician Quality Reporting measures consist of two major components. Each component is defined by specific codes described in the respective measure's specification along with the reporting instructions and use of modifiers.The first measure component is the denominator, which describes the eligible cases for a measure or the eligible patient population. Physician Quality Reporting measure denominators are identified by ICD-9-CM (future ICD-10-CM), CPT Category I, and HCPCS codes, as well as patient demographics (age, gender, etc), and place of service (if applicable). For registry and EHR reporting, other clinical coding sets may be included such as SNOMED, LOINC, or RxNorm.The second component is the numerator describing the specific clinical action required by the measure for performance. Eligible professionals may use the codes present in the numerator to report the outcome of the action as indicated by the measure. Physician Quality Reporting measure numerators are quality-data codes (QDCs) consisting of specified non-payable CPT Category II codes and/or temporary G-codes. For registry and EHR reporting, other clinical coding sets may be included such as SNOMED, LOINC, or RxNorm in order to capture a specific quality action, test, or value.Calculating the Physician Quality Reporting System reporting rate (dividing the numerator by the denominator) identifies the percentage of a defined patient population that was reported for the measure. For performance rate calculations, some patients may be excluded from the denominator based on medical, patient or system exclusions allowed by the measure.The final performance rate calculation represents the eligible population that received a particular process of care or achieved a particular outcome. It is important to review and understand each measure's specification, as it contains definitions and specific instructions for reporting the measure. See http://www.cms.gov/PQRS/15_MeasuresCodes.aspMeasure Applicability Validation (MAV) is automatically triggered in scenarios where less than nine measures OR less ... (more)Measure Applicability Validation (MAV) is automatically triggered in scenarios where less than nine measures OR less than three domains are satisfactorily reported by claims-based and registry-based reporters. If MAV analytically determines that the individual eligible professional (EP) or group practice could have reported additional measures or domains within the clinical cluster, then the 2014 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) incentive would not be earned and the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment may apply.If MAV analytically determines that the individual EP or group practice could NOT have reported additional measures or domains within the clinical cluster, the EP or group practice would be eligible for the 2014 PQRS incentive and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment.Please contact the QualityNet help desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via the new e-mail address at qnetsupport@hcqis.org should you have any additional questions.EPs and group practices are responsible for satisfying all applicable PQRS reporting requirements, regardless of the ... (more)EPs and group practices are responsible for satisfying all applicable PQRS reporting requirements, regardless of the status of their EHR system. Specifically, EPs and group practices reporting 2014 PQRS measures via direct EHR product or EHR data submission vendor are required to submit all (i.e., 100%) of their eligible patient data for the 9 measures across 3 domains on which they are reporting in order to meet the criteria for 2014 PQRS incentive eligibility and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment. For example: the Influenza Immunization Measure (CMS 147v2 NQF 0041) per the measure specification should only be reported for patients seen during the Flu season which is not the full 12 month reporting period but all the patients that were seen during the flu season should be submitted. If an EPs or group practices certified EHR technology (CEHRT) system does not contain patient data for at least 9 measures covering at least 3 domains, then the EP or group practice must report the measures for which there is Medicare patient data. An EP or group practice must report on at least 1 measure for which there is Medicare patient data in order to meet the criteria for 2014 PQRS incentive eligibility and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment.EPs and group practices that submit less than one full year of data bear the risk that doing so may prevent EPs and group practices from meeting the measure criteria for PQRS and can impact their performance scores for the physician value-based payment modifier (VM).Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions.

(more)If you are in your first year of MU you cannot report once to both PQRS & MU. Individual EPs who are in their first year of Meaningful Use must individually submit and attest to their CQM data. These EPs must demonstrate Meaningful Use for a 90-day reporting period in 2014 to avoid the payment adjustment in 2015. This reporting period must occur in the first 9 months of calendar year 2014, and EPs must attest to Meaningful Use no later than October 1, 2014, to avoid the payment adjustment. This attestation will not count towards PQRS reporting; therefore you would need to report for PQRS separately to potentially earn the 2014 PQRS Incentive and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment. Please refer to the PQRS website at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS for further information on PQRS reporting options.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions.

(more)The PQRS, MU, and VM, payment adjustments will apply to all eligible professionals (EPs) Part B covered professional services. Covered professional services are defined as services furnished by an EP for which payment is made under, or is based on, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) as provided in section 1848(k)(3) of the Act. Because the payment adjustment only applies to Part B MPFS claims and Part B drugs are not paid on the MPFS, the actual drug is not subjected to the payment adjustment. However, the administration of drugs by an EP is subject to the payment adjustment. For example, J2778 (Lucentis) would not be subjected to the payment adjustment but 67028 (intravitreal injection), would be subjected to the payment adjustment.The PQRS 0% performance rule only applies to satisfactory reporting for 2013 PQRS incentive eligibility. The 0% performance rate does not apply to the less stringent reporting criteria of reporting 1 valid measure or 1 valid measures group, or electing to participate in the administrative claims reporting mechanism, for purposes of avoiding the 2015 PQRS payment adjustment.However, CMS strongly encourages all eligible professionals and group practices to become familiar with the PQRS requirements for satisfactorily reporting and meeting the 0% performance rule for incentive eligibility. CMS indicated in the 2013 PFS Final Rule that the less stringent reporting criteria (reporting 1 valid measure or 1 valid measures group, or electing to participate in the administrative claims-based reporting mechanism) may be temporary. Rulemaking will determine whether or not the less stringent reporting criteria will be available in future program years.See the How to Get Started section of the CMS Physician Quality Reporting website at http://www.cms.gov/PQRS/03_How_To_Get_Started.asp. Use the Physician Quality Reporting System Measures Specifications Manual for Claims and Registry Reporting & Release Notes as the primary authoritative source identifying the codes and corresponding reporting instructions for reporting measures via claims or registry. You should also review the Physician Quality Reporting System Implementation Guide. It provides guidance about how to implement claims-based reporting of measures to facilitate satisfactory reporting of QDCs for the program. Also see the Alternative Reporting Mechanisms section at http://www.cms.gov/PQRS/20_AlternativeReportingMechanisms.asp.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is committed to ensuring clinicians provide performance information based on the most current clinical guidelines and is actively working with measure stewards to update the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) measures specifications for Program Year 2015. CMS will provide additional information as it becomes available and update this Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) accordingly.The 2014 PQRS measures covering low-density lipid control clinical concepts were not updated to match the latest ATP 4 clinical guidelines. 2014 PQRS measures were legislatively mandated to be published prior to January 1, 2014. Since the updated clinical guidelines were not published until the last quarter of 2013, CMS and measure stewards did not have adequate time to determine appropriate updates required for all PQRS measures affected by the new guidelines.Even though the 2014 measures do not reflect the most current guidelines, CMS still believes measures that represent the clinical concepts of low-density lipid control are important cross-cutting measures to be maintained within PQRS and other reporting programs as they are important indicators of provider quality.The 2014 measure specifications reflected the recommended scientific clinical guidance at the time of publication. The impact of the updated guidelines to PQRS measures are actively being evaluated by measure stewards in order to make appropriate modifications to the 2015 PQRS measures.Measure concepts related to blood pressure and low-density lipid control that co-exist within PQRS and Meaningful Use may not be in alignment. This is due to the timing for each of these reporting programs to receive and implement measure revisions for the upcoming program years.CMS encourages clinicians to manage care based on the most current clinical guidelines. The recommendation would be to report on measures that best represent the quality of care provided to patients. Please review each measures numerator options to ensure that the most accurate option is reported or submitted for the measure chosen to report.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via e-mail at qnetsupport@hcqis.org should you have additional questions regarding this topic.CMS will investigate whether the EP, CPC practice site, or group practice or ACO participating via GPRO met the criteria for satisfactorily reporting under PQRS to either receive an incentive or avoid the negative payment adjustment. The informal review decision is final and there will be no further review.Informal reviews may only be submitted via the Quality Reporting Communication Support Page (CSP) between January 1, 2015 and February 28, 2015. CMS will announce the availability of this page through MLN Connects Provider eNews and the PQRS Listserv.

(more)Services furnished by RHCs and FQHCs are not eligible for the PQRS incentive payment and are not subject to the PQRS negative payment adjustment. Only covered professional services furnished by eligible health care professionals (EPs) that are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) are eligible for PQRS.Please review the Tax Identification Number (TIN)/National Provider Identifier (NPI) combination included in the letter received from CMS, as this is the individual provider to whom the 2015 payment adjustment will apply, not the clinic or facility. An example of why a physician who practices at an RHC/FQHC may be subject to the 2015 payment adjustment is that (s)he bills non-RHC or non-FQHC services under the MPFS via the 1500 claim form. The providers contact information used to send the 2015 PQRS negative payment adjustment letters was gathered from the Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS). Letters that include only a TIN apply to the entire group practice as the TIN is registered to participate in the 2013 PQRS GPRO. The groups contact information used to send the 2015 PQRS negative payment adjustment letters was gathered from the 2013 PQRS GPRO registration or self-nomination system.CMS would also like to remind participants that there are no hardship or low volume exemptions for the PQRS payment adjustment. All EPs who billed Medicare Part B for non-RHC/FQHC services in 2013 must have satisfactorily reported PQRS in order to avoid the 2015 negative payment adjustment.As outlined in the 2015 PQRS payment adjustment letter, if you believe that the 2015 PQRS payment adjustment is being applied in error, you can submit an informal review request. All informal review requests must be submitted via a web-based tool, the Quality Reporting Communication Support Page (Communication Support Page), during the informal review period, January 1, 2015 through February 28, 2015.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions.

(more)Medicare Advantage organization (MAO) payments to contracted providers are governed by the terms of the contract between the MAO and the provider. This includes incentive bonus payment arrangements paid to providers for quality reporting and electronic prescribing. MA organizations are generally not required to pay PQRS and eRx incentive payments to provider with whom they contract.When a MA organization does not have an existing contract in place governing payment amounts, a provider is entitled to Fee-forService rates with respect to any MA enrollee it provides services to. The requirement is for a Medicare Advantage organization to pay non-contracted providers (including providers who are deemed to be contracting under private fee for service (PFFS) plans) the original Medicare payment amount. Therefore, a MA organization is required to pay PQRS and eRX Incentive Program payments to non-contract providers who qualify for these payments under original Medicare.An MA organization calculates the incentive bonus payment using the same formula as original Medicare. The incentive payment amount is calculated as a percentage of Medicare Part B estimated total allowed charges. Providers are not entitled to PQRS and eRX incentive payments from original Medicare for care provided to MA enrollees.If a professional has assigned Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) billing to an employer, the eligible professional m... (more)If a professional has assigned Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) billing to an employer, the eligible professional may participate. The employer, on behalf of the eligible professional, can submit the Physician Quality Reporting clinical measure CPT Category II codes or G-codes on Part B professional services claims and pursue the financial incentive. When the claim is billed, the individual NPI must be in the rendering NPI field to be able to calculate the data at the individual NPI level. In situations where eligible professionals who are employees or contractors have assigned their payments to their employers, the statute requires that any financial incentive earned will be paid to the employers or facilities.For additional information, please go to the Overview section of the CMS Physician Quality Reporting System website at http://www.cms.gov/pqrs.In the fall of 2014, CMS disseminated physician feedback reports, called Quality Reporting and Usage Reports (QRURs), containing CY 2013 data to groups of physicians subject to the VM. These reports will be the basis of the VM in 2015. After receiving their QRURs, physicians may e-mail or call a technical help desk to inquire about their report and the calculation of the VM. CMS has adopted this process to help educate and inform physicians about the Value Modifier, especially for those groups of physicians that have elected to have their VM calculated using a quality-tiering approach.Questions about the Value Modifier can be directed to the Physician Value (PV) Help Desk at 1-888-734-6433, press option 3 (TTY 1-888-734-6563) or by email to pvhelpdesk@cms.hhs.gov Monday  Friday: 8:00 a.m.  8:00 p.m. EST.CMS has a single contractor responsible for CAHPS for PQRS survey implementation for the 2014 program year.

If MAV analytically determines that the individual EP or group practice could have reported additional measures or domains within the clinical cluster, then the 2014 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) incentive would not be earned and the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment may apply.If MAV analytically determines that the individual EP or group practice could NOT have reported additional measures or domains within the clinical cluster, the individual EP or group practice would be eligible for the 2014 PQRS incentive and avoid the 2016 PQRS payment adjustment.Please contact the QualityNet help desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via the new e-mail address at qnetsupport@hcqis.org should you have any additional questions.The Physician Reporting quality-data codes (QDCs) HCPCS codes follow current rules for reporting other HCPCS codes (e.g., CPT Category I codes). On the ASC X12N 837 professional health care claim transaction, HCPCS procedure codes are submitted in the SV1 "Professional Service" Segment of the 2400 "Service Line" Loop. The data element for the procedure code is SV101-2 "Product/Service ID." Note that it is also necessary to identify in this segment that you are supplying a HCPCS code by submitting the "HC" code for data element SV101-1. For claims submitted on the CMS 1500 Form, procedure codes are reported in field 24D. Whether submitting electronic or paper claims, complete all the necessary data elements (or fields) on the billing line item. Necessary data elements/fields include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:Date of service; Place of service; Physician Reporting QDC(s), along with modifier (if appropriate); Diagnosis pointer; Submitted charge ($0.00 should be entered for Physician Reporting codes); Rendering provider number (NPI). NOTE: The submitted charge field cannot be left blank. The amount of $0.00 should be entered on the claim as the charge. If the physician's billing software does not accept a $0.00 charge, a nominal amount can be substituted. Whether the correct $0.00 charge or a nominal amount is submitted to the Carrier/MAC, the Physician Quality Reporting code line is denied and tracked. The Remittance Advice associated with the claim containing the Physician Reporting QDC line item will include a standard Remark Code (N365) and a message that will read as follows: "This procedure code is not payable. It is for reporting/information purposes only." This remittance advice confirms that the Physician Quality Reporting code(s) passed into the National Claims History (NCH) file for use in calculating incentive eligibility. Eligible professionals should note that the submission of a non-zero charge amount with Physician Quality Reporting codes may complicate secondary payers' processing of the claims. Physicians and other eligible professionals are not allowed to collect any monies from beneficiaries for charges submitted for the Physician Reporting codes. See the Physician Quality Reporting Implementation Guide.The eligible professional will need to pay close attention to PQRS measures group patient sample criteria, and report on... (more)The eligible professional will need to pay close attention to PQRS measures group patient sample criteria, and report on at least 20 unique Medicare Part B FFS patients to whom the measures group applies (when reporting via registry, a minimum of 11 eligible patients must be Medicare Part B FFS). Immediate feedback as to whether the eligible professional has accurately identified and reported all 20 required unique patients is not available. The eligible professional can check the Remittance Advice to ensure that quality-data codes (QDCs) reported were processed and denied as indicated by remark code N365 on the Explanation of Benefits or EOB when reporting via claims. CMS would also recommend reporting on more than 20 patients, in case there are issues with rejected or pending claims, ineligible patients, or any other situation that may lead to exclusions from the 20 patient sample.Note: The N365 denial code is just an indicator that the QDC codes were recognized by the carrier/MAC as being part of the PQRS program. It does not guarantee the QDC is valid for the measure or that incentive quotas were met.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is committed to ensuring clinicians provide performance information based on the most current clinical guidelines and is actively working with measure stewards to update the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) measures specifications for Program Year 2015. CMS will provide additional information as it becomes available and update this Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) accordingly.The 2014 PQRS measures covering blood pressure clinical concepts were not updated to match the latest JNC 8 clinical guidelines. 2014 PQRS measures were legislatively mandated to be published prior to January 1, 2014. Since the updated clinical guidelines were not published until the last quarter of 2013, CMS and measure stewards did not have adequate time to determine appropriate updates required for all PQRS measures affected by the new guidelines.Even though the 2014 measures do not reflect the most current guidelines, CMS still believes measures that represent the clinical concepts of blood pressure are important cross-cutting measures to be maintained within PQRS and other reporting programs as they are important indicators of provider quality.The 2014 measure specifications reflected the recommended scientific clinical guidance at the time of publication. The impact of the updated guidelines to PQRS measures are actively being evaluated by measure stewards in order to make appropriate modifications to the 2015 PQRS measures.Measure concepts related to blood pressure and low-density lipid control that co-exist within PQRS and Meaningful Use may not be in alignment. This is due to the timing for each of these reporting programs to receive and implement measure revisions for the upcoming program years.CMS encourages clinicians to manage care based on the most current clinical guidelines. The recommendation would be to report on measures that best represent the quality of care provided to patients. Please review each measures numerator options to ensure that the most accurate option is reported or submitted for the measure chosen to report.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via e-mail at qnetsupport@hcqis.org should you have additional questions regarding this topic.If you are an eligible professional (EP) or group practice who participated in the 2013 PQRS and believe that your 2013 ...

However, EPs who bill using CAH Method II WILL be able to report PQRS via Registry, Electronic Health Record (EHR), qualified clinical data registry (QCDR), and Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO).For the 2015 PQRS program year, EPs who bill using CAH Method II WILL be able to report via the claims-based reporting mechanism as the claims system has been updated to pull PQRS quality-data codes (QDCs) off the 1450 claim form. EPs who bill using CAH Method II WILL also be able to report PQRS via Registry, Electronic Health Record (EHR), qualified clinical data registry (QCDR), and Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO).Please refer to your Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) if you need assistance determining whether or not you bill Medicare Part B PFS services.

(more)In Program Year 2014, PQRS and the EHR Incentive Program completely aligned the measures to utilize the electronic specifications for clinical quality measures (eCQMs). For the EHR Incentive Program, PQRS Measure #316 was divided into two eCQMs: CMS61 and CMS64. Therefore, CMS61 and CMS64 will be counted as two separate measures to meet the satisfactorily reporting requirements of reporting on at least 9 measures across 3 domains. For PQRS, these measures will be represented as 316a and 316b, respectively.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via e-mail at qnetsupport@hcqis.org should you have additional questions regarding this topic.The analysis of satisfactory reporting will be performed at the individual eligible professional level within each TIN, ... (more)The analysis of satisfactory reporting will be performed at the individual eligible professional level within each TIN, using individual-level National Provider Identifier (NPI) to identify each professional's services and quality data. Incentives earned by individual professionals will be issued to the TIN under which he or she earned an incentive, based on the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) professional services claims submitted under the TIN, aggregating individual eligible professionals' incentives to the TIN level. For eligible professionals who submit claims under multiple TINs, CMS groups claims by TIN for analysis and payment purposes. As a result, a professional who submits claims under multiple TINs may earn a Physician Quality Reporting incentive under one of the TINs and not the other(s), or may earn an incentive under each TIN. The financial incentive earned by any individual professional under a given TIN, based on the claims associated with that TIN, will be included in that TIN's aggregate Physician Quality Reporting incentive payment.

Therefore, no assessment of internal carotid stenosis may be possible in these cases, and for these it is appropriate to report PQRS measure #195 using 3100F-8P: Carotid imaging study report did not include direct or indirect references to measurements of distal internal carotid diameter as the denominator for stenosis measurement, reason not otherwise specified.Reporting this numerator outcome will contribute to the overall reporting rate for the measure. For 2013, in order to satisfactorily report to earn an incentive an eligible professional would need to submit at least 50% of their applicable Medicare Part B FFS patients via the claims-based reporting mechanism or at least 80% via registry. Please note, submitting an 8P reporting modifier for all denominator-eligible patients will result in a 0% performance rate and the measure will not count toward earning the 2013 incentive. The recommended clinical quality action must be performed on at least one patient for each individual measure reported by the eligible professional.*For more information on CPT coding for diagnostic studies of the cervicocerebral arteries, refer to the AMA cpt Assistant May 2013, Volume 23 Issue 5.Yes.

(more)Every Physician Quality Reporting measure within a measures group must be reported on each unique patient in the eligible professional's sample to whom the measure(s) applies. In many cases, all the measures in a group will apply to all the patients in the measures group sample, but in some cases only some of the measures in a group will apply to each patient. For example, the Preventive Care measures group includes three measures that apply only to female patients; the eligible professional would be required to report these measures on females in the measures group sample who are within each measure's specific age range. They would not be expected to report a female-specific measure on a male patient or on a female patient outside the measure's specified age range.An eligible professional could choose to report Physician Quality Reporting measures that are not applicable to a patient to ensure complete reporting; however, these patients will be ignored in the 30-patient sample count. (For example, there is no penalty for reporting diabetes measures on an 80-year-old patient, but the count for the 30-patient sample will include only patients in the 18-75 year range for the Diabetes Mellitus measures group).The 2012 Physician Quality Reporting System Claims-Based Measures Groups Specifications Manual, posted on the CMS website, contains an overview page for each measures group that details the reporting requirements.CMS is required by statute to validate, prior to making any incentive payment to participants reporting individual me... (more)CMS is required by statute to validate, prior to making any incentive payment to participants reporting individual measures through claims, whether participating eligible professionals have satisfactorily submitted quality data for at least the statutory minimum number of measures, based on the number of available measures that are applicable to their practices. Thus, CMS will apply MAV in situations where eligible professionals have submitted quality data for fewer than three quality measures and achieved at least a 50% reporting rate for 2013 on each measure for which data were submitted. If CMS finds that there are additional measures applicable to such professionals' practices for that reporting period, these professionals will not be eligible for a PQRS incentive payment.Detailed descriptions of the MAV processes for each program year are available from the Analysis and Payment page on the CMS PQRS website.Yes.

Independent Laboratories (ILs) are a supplier specialty (69), not a physician specialty and are therefore not eligible to participate in the Physician Quality Reporting incentive program. Providers not defined as eligible professionals in the Tax Relief Health Care Act of 2006 or the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 are not eligible to participate in Physician Quality Reporting and do not qualify for an incentive. An IL is enrolled in Medicare as an organization and therefore bills under its own facility national provider identifier (NPI). An IL claim cannot show a physician's individual NPI on the rendering/performing provider ID line on the claim. If an IL claim is submitted with a rendering NPI of a physician on the claim, that claim would be rejected by the Carrier/MAC. Also, the physician cannot reassign her/his benefits to the IL. Therefore, when an IL enrolls in Medicare, it is set up much like an Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF) in that there is no individual rendering/performing provider billed on the claim. Since ILs are an organization and not a group, they are not able to participate in Physician Quality Reporting through claims-based reporting. (FAQ2383) lessYes.

Eligible professionals must successfully generate and report electronic prescriptions 25 times for the 2013 eRx Incentive Program measure denominator-eligible services any time in 2013 (January 1-December 31, 2013) to receive the 2013 eRx Incentive Program incentive payment.If participating in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, eligible professionals can still report the eRx Incentive Program measure, but are only eligible to receive one incentive payment for 2013. Eligible professionals successfully participating in both programs will receive the EHR Incentive Program incentive payment. If an eligible professional fails to report satisfactorily for the EHR Incentive Program, but reports successfully for the eRx Incentive Program, (s)he may receive the 2013 eRx Incentive Program incentive payment.Note: Participation in the EHR Incentive Program may exempt an eligible professional from the 2014 eRx Incentive Program payment adjustment; however, eligible professionals are encouraged to report the required number of eRx events or request a hardship exemption (if applicable) during the 2013 eRx 6-month reporting period (January 1-June 30, 2013) to be sure they avoid the 2014 eRx payment adjustment. Information on the eRx Incentive Program payment adjustment is available at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/ERxIncentive. Also, those eligible professionals and group practices who satisfactorily report 2013 PQRS may avoid the 2015 PQRS payment adjustment.

(more)Eligible professionals (EPs) at IDTFs will not be subject to the 2015 or 2016 PQRS negative payment adjustment only for services rendered at the IDTF. However, EPs who render services at IDTFs should participate in the PQRS starting in 2015 to avoid the PQRS negative payment adjustment in 2017 and beyond.During PQRS program years 2013 and 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued guidance that EPs who rendered services at independent diagnostic testing facilities (IDTFs) would be eligible, but not able, to participate in PQRS due to their billing methodology. However, based on recent analysis, CMS has identified that services provided at or on behalf of an IDTF align with the billing methodology used for PQRS; therefore, these EPs are eligible and able to participate in PQRS.CMS is working to correct this guidance; therefore, EPs who rendered services at IDTFs will not receive the negative 2015 or 2016 PQRS payment adjustment. If an EP working at an IDTF receives a PQRS payment adjustment on his or her 2015 Part B MPFS reimbursements, the claim will be automatically reprocessed to return the 1.5 (or 2.0) percent adjustment only for services rendered at the IDTF. Please allow several months for reprocessing of claims and corrections to the payment adjustments. The remittance advice for the reprocessed claims will indicate that the payment represents a previous reduction based on the PQRS, as indicted by the following claim adjustment reason code (CARC) and remittance advice remark code (RARC):CARC 237  Legislated/Regulatory Penalty, to designate when an upward payment adjustment will be applied.Starting with PQRS program year 2015, EPs who render Part B MPFS services via the CMS-1500 form or electronic equivalent at an IDTF facility or on its behalf should participate in the PQRS to avoid the negative 2017 PQRS payment adjustment. Information on how to participate in the 2015 PQRS is available on the CMS PQRS website.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions.

(more)For those group practices who registered to participate in the PQRS GPRO, the EHR Direct or a Data Submission Vendor (referred to as the EHR vendor) will need to analyze the groups data at the Tax Identification Number (TIN) level. The EHR vendor must aggregate the data at the TIN level to ensure that the data is calculated correctly for group practice reporting. If the EHR vendor does not analyze this measure at the TIN level, then some encounters may not be included when computing the measure; resulting in an incorrect reporting rate.For example, CMS measure #147 requires two or more encounters during the measurement period. For group practice reporting, the EHR vendor must take into account all patient visits from all eligible professionals (EPs) under the TIN. Therefore, if a patient has multiple encounters with different eligible professionals under the TIN, then the patient will be counted in the initial patient population (IPP) for this measure only once. The group should submit data for the measure regardless of whether the group met the performance for this patient or not.Contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via email to Qnetsupport@hcqis.org.

(more)There are two options for reporting quality-data codes (QDCs) for the Physician Quality Reporting measures groups. The individual eligible professional may report QDCs on all individual measures within the measures group OR report one (composite) G-code which indicates the performance (quality action) of all measures in the group were performed (e.g. G8490, which indicates all quality actions for the applicable measures in the rheumatoid arthritis measures group have been performed for the patient).If all of the quality actions for the measures within the measures group were performed at an encounter during the reporting period, the eligible professional could report the composite G-code instead of reporting QDCs for each measure individually. Please note that measure #1 (Diabetes Mellitus: Hemoglobin A1c Poor Control in Diabetes Mellitus) in the Diabetes Mellitus measures group is a poor control or inverse measure; therefore, the composite G-code should only be reported when the patient's Most Recent Hemoglobin A1c Level is in control (? 9.0%) and all of the other quality actions for this measures group have been performed for the patient.Note that performance exclusion modifiers (i.e., 1P, 2P, 3P or G-code equivalent) and the 8P reporting modifier cannot apply to the reporting of any measure within the measures group if the composite G-code is used for reporting because all of the quality actions for each measure must have been performed and documented.Measures groups containing a measure with a 0% performance rate will not be counted as satisfactorily reporting the measures group. The recommended clinical quality action must be performed on at least one patient for each measure within the measures group reported by the eligible professional. When a lower rate indicates better performance, such as Measure #1, a 0% performance rate will be counted as satisfactorily reporting (100% performance rate would not be considered satisfactorily reporting). Performance exclusion quality-data codes are not counted in the performance denominator. If the eligible professional submits all performance exclusion quality-data codes, the performance rate would be 0/0 (null) and would be considered satisfactorily reporting.

If it is determined that the group practice satisfactorily reports data on Physician Quality Reporting measures, the practice will be eligible for an incentive payment equal to one percent of the practice's total estimated Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) allowed charges.The GPRO II reporting mechanism is via claims. If the group does not have an applicable measures group to report via claims, the practice can report that measures group via a qualified registry. The reporting requirements for GPRO II are determined on a tiered basis depending on the group's size. Groups selected to participate in GPRO II will use the Physician Quality Reporting System Measure Specifications Manual for Claims and Registry Reporting of Individual Measures and the Physician Quality Reporting System Measures Groups Specifications Manual for the respective reporting year.To participate in GPRO II, group practices must go through a self-nomination process and be selected by CMS to participate. A maximum of 500 group practices will be selected. Individual eligible professionals who are a member of a group practice selected to participate in Physician Quality Reporting GPRO II are not eligible to separately earn a Physician Quality Reporting incentive payment under the same TIN/NPI combination. Once a group practice is selected to participate in GPRO II, this is the only method of reporting available to the group and all individual NPIs who bill Medicare under the group's TIN.For more information, see the Group Practice Reporting Option section of the CMS Physician Quality Reporting website at http://www.cms.gov/pqrs.Group practices of 25 or more eligible professionals must register to participate under the Group Practice Reporting Opt...

(more)Beginning in 2015, CMS will subject eligible professionals who are not successful reporters under Physician Quality Reporting to a payment adjustment.If subject to the 2015 Physician Quality Reporting payment adjustment, eligible professionals will be paid 1.5% less than the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) amount for services rendered in 2015. In 2016 and each subsequent year, the payment adjustment increases to 2.0%. The payment adjustment will be applied to all of the eligible professional's Part B-covered professional services under the Medicare PFS.Please try to select and submit under one hardship exemption category. We encourage eligible professionals to choose the hardship exemption category most accurately describing the hardship situation. Please use the "Justification for Hardship Exemption" field to request consideration for one or more of the other listed exemption categories as finalized in the 2011 eRx Rule.For any questions or concerns, please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 866-288-8912 (TTY 877-715-6222) from 7:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m. CST Monday through Friday or via e-mail to Qnetsupport@sdps.org.Yes. Individual eligible professionals (EPs) and group practices participating via the group practice reporting option (GPRO) may select more than one registry to submit data on their behalf. If an EP or group practice participating via GPRO submits quality measure data via multiple registries, PQRS will not combine the data but rather will evaluate each registrys data individually as a unique reporting method for that EP or group practice participating via GPRO. PQRS will accept and use the most recent version of every measure submitted by a single registry for a group practice or EP. The most advantageous submission from one registry will be used for determining the incentive eligibility and subjectivity to the payment adjustment for the EPs and group practices.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org for help with questions.

(more)The intent of this measure is to capture isolated CABG surgeries for patients that received a beta-blocker within 24 hours prior to surgical incisions. This measure was updated for Program Year 2014 to allow anesthesiologist to report this measure. In order to ensure that the only surgeries allowed into the denominator for the measures are isolated CABG surgeries, the anesthesiologist CPT code (00562) (which is not specific to isolated CABG) would need to be in conjunction with the CPT indicated for the CABG surgery (33530) and one of the other CABG codes (33510, 33511, 33512, 33513, 33514, 33516, 33517, 33518, 33519, 33521, 33522, 33523, 33533, 33534, 33535, 33536).For claims-based billing the eligible professional (EP), whether it is the anesthesiologist or the surgeon, is only responsible for reporting the CPT coding that is relevant to them. Therefore, in order for claims data to establish the correct patient population, the surgical codes need to be utilized. Anesthesiologist are not required to report the procedure coding, as this is will be analytically handled by the PQRS system.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via e-mail at qnetsupport@sdps.org should you have additional questions regarding this topic.As soon as CMS announces the beginning of the 2011 PQRS Informal Review request period, valid 2011 PQRS Informal Review requests must be submitted via the Communication Support Page, available at http://www.qualitynet.org/pqrs, prior to midnight, 11:59pm EST, on February 28, 2013.

The eligible professional's individual NPI must be listed along with the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for services, procedures, and quality data on the claim. Thus, to participate in Physician Quality Reporting as an individual eligible professional, they must have their individual-level NPIs and must consistently use their individual NPIs to correctly identify their services, procedures, and quality-data codes for an accurate determination of satisfactory reporting. CMS-selected Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) participants may submit quality data via an alternative mechanism with rates calculated at the TIN level.

These three POS codes are not used in incentive payment calculations. If you are an eligible professional, work exclusively at any of these facilities, and bill Medicare Part B with one of these POS codes, you unfortunately are unable to participate in Physician Quality Reporting or the eRx Incentive Program. You would also be exempt from eRx payment adjustments.There are measure-specific requirements regarding POS.

(more)CMS has recently identified an error related to the submission of Measure #235 "Hypertension: Plan of Care" for the 2012 Physician Quality Reporting System (Physician Quality Reporting). Hypertension: Plan of Care, is a measure that is reportable via claims or registry based submissions. Eligible professionals who report this measure via claims (or utilize Quality-Data Codes (QDCs) for registry-based reporting) will find that the associated QDCs are being rejected. Consequently, this has resulted in claims containing the QDCs associated with all or part of the claim the being rejected/denied by clearinghouses, Carriers or A/B Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs).The codes (G8675, G8676, G8677, G8678, G8679, G8680, 4050F) will be reactivated in April 2012. For 2012 claims-based reporting, Physician Quality Reporting requires at least 3 measures to each be reported at a 50% reporting rate. Eligible professionals who had intended to report this measure via claims (or utilize Quality-Data Codes (QDCs) for registry-based reporting) for 2012 Physician Quality Reporting may want to consider taking the following steps: "Hypertension: Plan of Care" is a per visit measure, which requires reporting for 50% of eligible patient visits. Therefore, eligible professionals should report the measure on more than 50% of eligible visits from April through December 2012 to increase the likelihood for successful reporting of the measure.Claims may NOT be resubmitted for the sole purpose of adding or correcting QDCs. If a denied claim is subsequently corrected through the appeals process to the Carrier or A/B MAC, with accurate codes that also correspond to the measures denominator, then QDCs that correspond to the numerator should also be included on the resubmitted claim as instructed in the measure specifications.The majority of Physician Quality Reporting quality-data codes (numerator codes) are CPT Category II codes, although some measures may use G-codes. Detailed specifications for each quality measure are available on the CMS Physician Quality Reporting website as a download from the Measures Codes page (http://www.cms.gov/PQRS). The Single Source Code Master, a numerical listing of all codes included in Physician Quality Reporting, for professionals' use in setting up their billing/coding systems to capture all Physician Quality Reporting codes and modifiers, is also available on the CMS Physician Quality Reporting website as a download from the Measures Codes page.

The requirement of reporting cross-cutting measures is new to the Physician Quality Reporting System PQRS) program beginning in 2015.The requirement of reporting a cross-cutting measure is triggered if an EP or a group practice bills a face-to-face encounter. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) defines a face-to-face encounter as an instance in which the EP or group practice billed for services that are associated with face-to-face encounters under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). This includes general office visits, outpatient visits, and surgical procedure codes; however, CMS does not consider telehealth visits as a face-to-face encounter.For 2015 PQRS, if an EP or group practice bills a service defined as a face-to-face encounter, CMS will analyze claims-based data to determine if a cross-cutting measure may have been applicable. If at least 15 cross-cutting measure denominator eligible encounters are found for an EP or group practice, then CMS maintains that the cross-cutting measure was applicable for that EP to report. If less than 15 cross-cutting measure denominator eligible encounters occur, then the cross-cutting measure requirement would not be applicable.For more information regarding this topic, click the links below to access the Claims-Based and Registry-Based Measure Applicability Validation (MAV) Process documents:The 2014 PQRS specifications (individual measures and measures groups) for Measure #338 do not include a numerator op...

Therefore, if a patient was not prescribed antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months, they would not be considered denominator eligible for Measure #338 and would not qualify for this measure.The HIV/AIDS Measures Group includes Measure #338. If the patient is not denominator eligible for Measure #338 when reporting this measures group, then it is acceptable to not report a numerator quality action for Measure #338. Therefore, only patients with a diagnosis of HIV who were prescribed antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months and had a viral load test during the reporting period would be expected to have a numerator quality action in the HIV/AIDS Measures Group.Please contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 or via e-mail at qnetsupport@hcqis.org should you have additional questions regarding this topic.For the 2012 reporting period, an eligible professional should indicate his/her intention to report a Physician Quality ...

The recommended clinical quality action must be performed on at least one patient for each individual measure reported by the eligible professional. A 0% performance rate could be due to the fact that none of the providers eligible patients were in compliance for the measure or that the provider did not provide the correct quality action to the patient.Exception: When a lower rate indicates better performance, such as Measure #1 (Diabetes Mellitus: Hemoglobin A1c Poor Control in Diabetes Mellitus), a 0% performance rate will be counted as satisfactorily reporting (100% performance rate would not be considered satisfactorily reporting).Performance exclusion quality-data codes are not counted in the performance denominator. If the eligible professional submits all performance exclusion quality-data codes, the performance rate would be 0/0 (null) and would be considered satisfactorily reporting.No. Eligible professionals whose employers bill for their services through a FI cannot participate in Physician Quality Reporting or eRx. The statute requires analysis based on satisfactory reporting and total allowed Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) charges at the individual level.

Maintain a valid, unrestricted medical license in the United States; II. Participate in educational and self-assessment programs that require an assessment of what was learned; III. Demonstrate through a formalized, secure examination, that the physician has the fundamental diagnostic skills, medical knowledge and clinical judgment to provide quality care in their respective specialty; and IV. Successfully complete a qualified Maintenance of Certification program practice assessment.CMS has applied the more frequent participation requirement to Parts II-IV of the Maintenance of Certification Program definition above. The more frequent requirement does not apply to Part I of the Maintenance of Certification Program definition since a physician cannot become licensed more frequently than required.A Maintenance of Certification Program vendor/registry/entity, however, has the discretion to determine what a physician must do to "more frequently" participate in each of parts II-IV above. CMS is looking to see an attestation from the vendor/registry/entity that both the Maintenance of Certification program and the practice assessment are completed by the physician at least once more than is required by their particular program.

(more)Whether or not an eligible professional (EP) is deemed Medicare participating or non-participating (non-par), the PQRS payment adjustment will be applied to the allowed Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) rate before the beneficiary co-insurance is assessed and independent of other claim adjustmentsIf the EP does not participate (non-par) in Medicare (i.e., does not accept Medicare's allowed charges as payment in full for all of his/her Medicare patients), and is subject to a payment adjustment due to his/her failure to meet the reporting criteria established under the PQRS during the 2013 program period, the negative 1.5% 2015 PQRS payment adjustment will be applied after the initial 5% reduction of the allowed MPFS for being a non-participating Medicare provider.EPs, who choose not to accept assignment, may not charge the beneficiary more than the Medicare limiting charge for unassigned claims for Medicare services. Non-par, non-assigned EPs may choose to collect the entire amount up front from the beneficiary at the time of service. The maximum limiting charge is 115% of the MPFS amount. The beneficiary is not responsible for billed amounts in excess of the limiting charge for a covered service.Example 1: Non-par EP is not subject to the PQRS payment adjustmentIn calendar year 2015, a non-par, non-assigned EP provides a particular service equal to $100.00 based on the 2015 MPFS. First, the 5% reduction is applied for being a non-par. The adjusted MPFS for this service is $95.00. If the non-par EP is not subject to the PQRS payment adjustment, the adjusted and allowed MPFS amount would remain at $95.00. Following are steps for illustration:STEP 1: Apply Non-par adjustment (less 5%)Original amount for service based on 2015 MPFS: $100.00Calculate the 5% reduction for non-par status: $100.00 x 0.5 = $5.00Reduce the non-par MPFS allowed amount: $100.00 - $5.00 = $95.00The adjusted non-par MPFS amount ($95.00) would then be used to calculate the non-par limiting charge (up to 115%) for that service. For this example, the maximum non-par limiting charge allowed for the service would be $109.25 as illustrated by the following:STEP 2: Calculate the limiting charge allowed (up to the 115%)Limiting Charge Allowed: $95.00 x 1.15 = $109.25Example 2: Non-par EP is subject to the PQRS payment adjustmentIn calendar year 2015, a non-par, non-assigned EP is subject to the PQRS payment adjustment. He/she provides a particular service equal to $100.00 based on the 2015 MPFS. First, the MPFS amount for that particular service is reduced by 5% for being non-par and the resultant adjusted MPFS for this service is now $95.00. Next, the fee is reduced by 1.5% for the PQRS payment adjustment. The following illustrates these steps:The negative 1.5% PQRS adjustment will be applied to the adjusted MPFS amount ($95.00). Thus, $93.57 would be the new non-par adjusted MPFS amount for the initial $100.00 service.STEP 3: Calculate PQRS Limiting Charge (up to 115% of MPFS)Limiting Charge Allowed (115%): $93.57 x 1.15 = $107.61The non-par adjusted MPFS amount ($93.57) would be used when calculating the PQRS limiting charge; which, for this example would be $107.61 for the service.These examples are for informational purposes only and are not intended to take the place of the Remittance Advice.Additional information is available in the Medicare Learning Network (MLN) Fact Sheet 8667.

Services provided by institutional providers, such as SNFs under Medicare Part B, hospitals, home health agencies, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities (CORF), or outpatient rehabilitation facilities, are typically billed via Form CMS-1450, also known as the UB-04, or the electronic equivalent, which does not provide a field to enter the NPI. Therefore, services rendered under Medicare Part A or submitted via Form CMS-1450, UB-04, through the Fiscal Intermediary (FI) cannot be analyzed for PQRS if the NPI is not included.Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) services can be analyzed for PQRS if they are billed by the following methods:However, there may be instances where EPs who participate under the aforementioned institutions will render services under Medicare Part B PFS via the CMS-1500 claim form (paper or electronic) for denominator-eligible events, which will be eligible and able to participate in PQRS. For example, an EP who practices through a CORF may be able to participate in PQRS if (s)he bills for denominator-eligible services furnished incident to a physicians service via the CMS-1500 claim form.If you need assistance determining whether or not your provided services are included in PQRS measures, contact the QualityNet Help Desk at 1-866-288-8912 (TTY 1-877-715-6222) or via qnetsupport@hcqis.org.

Covered professional services are defined as services furnished by an EP for which payment is made under, or is based on, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) as provided in section 1848(k)(3) of the Act. Because the payment adjustment only applies to Part B MPFS claims and Part B drugs are not paid on the MPFS, the actual drug is not subjected to the payment adjustment. However, the administration of drugs by an EP is subject to the payment adjustment. For example, J2778 (Lucentis) would not be subjected to the payment adjustment but 67028 (intravitreal injection), would be subjected to the payment adjustment.
