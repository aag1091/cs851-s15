Hello everyone! I am currently working on a four-minute animation to "Harmony" from the album "Moonrise: A Symphonic Metal Opera" by The L-Train and Friends. This is by far my most ambitous animation project to date, and will likely take at least another year and a half to finish. I'm taking the time needed to produce every shot at my best quality.If you liked this song, but haven't heard the whole album yet, then what are you waiting for?! Check it out here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBvl-...Note that Harmony is the only song from Moonrise that I intend to animate.Since the animation is still very much a work in progress, everything shown in the animatic above is subject to change (and lots of tweaking). I'll probably post screenshots and updates every now and then to my deviantArt page, which can be found here, if you're interested: http://hydrusbeta.deviantart.com/
