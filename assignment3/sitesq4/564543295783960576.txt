Byron Cowart won Under Armour All-American Game MVP on Jan. 2 and earned high praise from former NFL head coach and ESPN analyst Herm Edwards afterwards."He's a little bit of a tweener. I don't know how much bigger he will get, but he can play in space, but his best attribute is putting his hand in the ground and rushing the quarterback," Edwards said postgame. "He's a special young man. I've been fortunate enough to coach this game for years now, and he's right up there with the kids I've coached before. Defensively, he's game-changer. He goes about his business, he's a leader, he was team captain -- he plays when the moment is big and he gets it. He's a hard working guy, he has a fantastic motor, he won't live off his talent, he's going to work at it. Whoever gets this guy, look out."Cowart, the nation's No. 1 strong-side defensive end, signed with Auburn over Florida on National Signing Day.
