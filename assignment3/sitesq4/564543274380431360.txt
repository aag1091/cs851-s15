Workshop on Robotics in AgricultureFull Day Workshop at ICRA '15UpdatesOverviewAgriculture faces a number of unique social, economic and environmental challenges. These include increasing globalisation and international competitiveness, climate variability, food security, shortages in labour, urban pressure on farmland, invasive species, and growing expectations on sustainability and land stewardship. Furthermore, the global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, requiring agricultural production to double in order to meet food demands. Farm enterprises require new and innovative technology to address these challenges. Robotics is one of these technologies that promises to provide a solution.This full-day workshop at ICRA '15 brings together researchers and industry working on novel approaches for long term operation across changing agricultural environments, including broad-acre crops, orchard crops, nurseries and greenhouses, and horticulture. The goal of the workshop is to discuss techniques that increase robustness and reliability for overall improvement of complete autonomy in the farm. This includes addressing the technology gap between the needs of the agriculture industry and existing robotic solutions and what the role of robotics researchers is in bridging this gap. Besides new concepts in perception for changes in appearance and geometry of the environment, new learning and adaptive approaches to novel environments (due to seasonal and weather changes or to adaptation for operation in a completely different crop) are also of special interest to the workshop.We explicitly encourage the submission of papers describing work in progress, preliminary results, novel concepts, and industry experiences. Contributions are expected from researchers working in different fields of robotics, computer vision, intelligent transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, manipulation, control, path planning, computer human interaction, machine learning, as well as end user and Original Equipment Manufacturer experiences, and technology integration in the agricultural workplace.
