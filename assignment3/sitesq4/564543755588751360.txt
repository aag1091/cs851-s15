DogLost - the UK's largest lost and found dog service. And we're free!Reuniting dogs with their ownersDogLost's busiest yearAs 2014 draws to a close, DogLost has had its busiest year ever. Nearly 18,500 dogs were registered lost or found with the country's largest lost and found dog service. Each month the website has 1.5 million page visits as the 82,000 members help dogs by postering or sharing across social media. And this year more than 14,000 people joined us to help reunite more dogs across the country.Increases in dog theft and dog abandonment have led to the increase which has seen DogLost reunite nearly 7,500 of them. Many of the found dogs were subsequently rehomed by dog wardens after being seen on the website.DogLost's helpline remained busy throughout the year and has been extended to 14 hours a day to provide support to owners who have lost their dogs or for members of the public who have found dogs.

So here is a little advice to keep your four-legged family member safe:Check that gates and fences are secure and that your dog can't dig his way out: A bored dog will always think the grass is greener.Keep exterior doors shut and locked at all timesAlways know where your dog is - however busy you are - and ideally assign one person to look after themDon't leave your dog in the garden for long periods, tied up outside a shop or in the car whilst you visit friends and relatives. Thieves work Christmas.And don't forget that chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions and many nuts are poisonous to dogs, so absolutely no Christmas cake or pudding!Christmas is one of the busiest times for DogLost with so many dogs going missing. But we will be manning our free helpline all over the Christmas period with our normal opening hours of 0700-2100.Search For DogsAll search fields are optionalDog IDDog's NameStatusGenderBreedRegionPostcode Prefix Photo List?Latest Comments29/04/15 [MIRTA LOCATED BUT NUMBERS NOT WORKING] I am sure they do but I hope batrersea have proper checks to make sure mirta isn't handed to a bogus friend Read More...29/04/15 [SCAMP] Just printed some off as I can go over Upton way tomorrow.
