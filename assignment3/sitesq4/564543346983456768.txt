Intent on regaining their financial security, security taken from them by their own government, they naively plot to recover their retirement losses. But, unbeknownst to them, they unleash the wrath of every competing governmental law enforcement agency, drug cartel and mob, all of them believing that they will undermine capitalism and the American way of life â€“ their way of life. And as the big boys descend on the lovable couple, they begin to fall in love, unaware of the trouble they started, unaware of their impending deaths.
