IMAGESDescriptionIn between creating longevity-inducing rice dishes, the good people of Japan like to kick back with an ice cold beer. But not just any ordinary beer â€“ Abashiri Blue Beer.It's not even just a little bit blue either, it's really blue. It's bluer than blueberries, bluer than the smurfs, bluer than the Blue Man Group, even bluer than Daniel Craig's glistening blue eyes.This striking beer achieves its unique aquamarine hue by using a blend of blue seaweed and locally grown flowers, it even contains water from melted icebergs. To sip this beautiful blue brew is to immerse yourself in the wild and colourful flavours of the frozen Abashiri coastline. Seriously, you're basically drinking the island, soon there'll be nothing left.More InformationThis item cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18.By purchasing this product you confirm that you are 18 years of age or older.
