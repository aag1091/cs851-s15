The Query Project: Vivek ShrayaVivek ShrayaVivek Shraya (Toronto)“Brian Francis’ Fruit is one of best contemporary gay coming-of-age stories I’ve read. The protagonist Peter Paddington’s struggle to connect and understand his own body is painfully relatable for any teenager.“As an adult, I also found Peter’s self-deprecating, honest and curious internal dialogue mirrored much of my own. Although he is not being your typical hero, I couldn’t help but fall in love with Peter, Brian’s wit, and this book.“Bonus points for it being set in Canada.”Vivek Shraya is a multimedia artist working in music, performance, literature, and film. He’s the author of God Loves Hair and She of the Mountains.
