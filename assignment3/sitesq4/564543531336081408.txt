Equal access to education, for people with disabilities is a fundamental human right. We know that technology has a huge opportunity to widen access to learning and enrich the learning experience; and, yet, we also know that it can inadvertently introduce new barriers.But implementing a workable and effective accessibility strategy in higher education has a number of complex challenges, including the unique mix of organizational, academic, financial and legal drivers that can make it difficult to create a coherent and sustainable campus-wide policy. The tension between academic standards, desire for innovation and excellence, and perceived restrictions that accessibility requirements might bring has always been close to the surface—most recently in discussions over the need for and predicted implications of the draft TEACH Act (see comments from Educause and from NCDAE/WebAIM as examples of different views).Here in the TPG UX team, many years of experience working in higher education have given us insight into some of the practical challenges that committed and enthusiastic advocates of digital accessibility who work in a university can’t address on their own. It’s also given us a passion to help higher education institutions come together to assess their current state, identify challenges and opportunities, and chart a route to a culture and practice of digital accessibility.We need to recognize these challenges that exist and are not easy to overcome, particularly where institutionalized practices or limitations of existing technology make digital accessibility hard to deliver effectively. We also need to identify and harness the enthusiasm, skills, and power that exists in copious quantities in every higher education institution that can help to make sure that accessibility is an influencing factor in creating, procuring and using technology in all aspects of a university’s operation.We’re on the cusp of a new era of inclusive, technology-enhanced learning experiences, and TPG is really excited to be part of it. That’s why we have such a strong commitment to work with educational organisations to help them deliver the highest quality and most inclusive online learning experiences.Thanks for all your help. Your people are solving problems that we thought were unsolvable months ago. Other companies we called upon just kept telling us to “dumb down” the site and we were ready to do so until we worked with TPG.Ken Isaacson, Vice President, Major League Baseball Advanced MediaGet in touchDiscuss your specific accessibility needs and find out how we can help:call +1 (603) 882-4122emailsales@paciellogroup.com
