Following a speech in which he equated radical Islam in today’s culture with Christian abuses from centuries ago, Barack Obama faced significant criticism from various sources.“Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place,” Obama asserted, “remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.”As Western Journalism reported, Rev. Franklin Graham explained the inherent differences between the two examples, noting that Islamic extremists are mirroring the life of Mohammed while Christians who committed murder during the Crusades were not following Christ’s lead.At least one group, however, enthusiastically approved of Obama’s comments during this week’s National Prayer Breakfast. The Council on American Islamic Relations released a statement by its national executive director heralding the speech as a clarification of terrorist motivation.“We thank President Obama for clearly separating the brutal actions of ISIS from the faith of Islam,” Nihad Awad wrote, “and for reminding us all that violence and injustice are not part of any faith.”
