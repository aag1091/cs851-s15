Humility is no sign of weakness or evil. It is the very thing called for in Christian scripture as well as other major religious holy texts and pedagogy. Sadly, examples of evil and inhumane acts cloaked in the guise of religious piety exist throughout history. I am proud that President Obama has chosen to point this out during a time of heightening fear, conflict and evil. Dehumanizing the “other” is never a life-affirming act. To the contrary, it sits at the very core of our capacity for hatred, violence, oppression and evil:“There are two narratives about radical Islamists, and indeed about enemies of any sort, that coexist in American culture. According to one, they are different from us — Muslims, Palestinians, Israelis, Communists, you name it. Thus, in the battle against Islamic extremism, Islam is, in part at least, the enemy.The other narrative is that all peoples, all creeds, all nations contain elements of moderation and extremism. Thankfully, racist Christian extremists are today a tiny minority within American Christianity. But only 100 years ago, they were as popular among American Christians as the Islamic State is among Muslims today. Thus, in the battle against Islamic extremism, it is extremism that is the enemy.Hysterical commentary notwithstanding, no one is suggesting that Christians are just like the Islamic State. But Obama did suggest that Christianity is like Islam; both faiths have the capacity to be exploited by extremists.Christians should not be insulted by the facts of history. Rather, all of us should be inspired by them to recognize the dangers of extremism — wherever they lie.”
