This is the question that must be raised (to the police investigators)," he told journalists prior to his questioning.Widjojanto thanked and said "good bye" to more than a hundred employees of the antigraft body and anticorruption activists in black costumes before going to the police headquarters in South Jakarta.He was summoned by the police investigators who would question him about his alleged role in directing a witness for giving false testimony in connection with the election dispute case.Accompanied by other KPK commissioners, including Abraham Samad and Adnan Pandu Raja, and his lawyers, Nursyahbani Katjasungkana and Leiliana Santoso, Widjojanto said his coming to the police headquarters was his respect to law."As a commissioner of a law enforcement body, I would like to show my class as a law enforcer who respect the law," he said.He further said that in combating corruption crimes, he was even ready for giving his life but he did believe that the almighty God would be in the side of those holding the truth. "Only the prayers of the poor and oppressed will help this nation," he said.The KPK commissioners announced on January 13, 2015 that Commissioner General Budi Gunawan, the sole candidate for the Indonesian Police Chief, was named a suspect in a corruption case.The antigraft bodys investigators accused Budi Gunawan of receiving bribes through a suspicious transaction when he headed the Police Headquarters Career Planning Bureau in 2003-2006 and other posts in the police.Since then, the KPK and Indonesian Police have been trapped into a conflict situation after certain elements in the society filed reports about the alleged wrongdoings of four KPK commissoners, including Bambang Widjojanto, in connection with different legal cases to the police.However, the only KPK commisssioner who has so far been named a suspect by the police is Bambang Widjojanto.(*)
