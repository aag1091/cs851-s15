The government’s statement blamed fans for failing to adhere to safety procedures and forcing their way into the Cairo stadium.Hardcore fans of Egyptian football club Zamalek SC, known as Ultras White Knights, clashed with police in front of an army-owned stadium in northeast Cairo when they tried to attend a match without buying tickets.
