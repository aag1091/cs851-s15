A robot vacuum tried to eat its sleeping owner's headThe future of robots is simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. For every mental image of sweet Wall-E, there's one of Terminator's invincible red eye. Will our robotic overloads be task-oriented, adorable, and friendly... or will they try to murder us in our sleep?Well if you believe the latter, then the future is already here! A 52-year-old South Korean woman was brutally attacked by a robot vacuum, and the fire department had to be called in to rescue her.The woman's Roomba-esque device was doing its thing, vacuuming the floor, when it happened upon her sleeping body. In the robot's defense, a pile of hair on the floor could easily be mistaken for trash of some sort. My own floor contains enough of my shedding that you could make a quilt out of it.So, you know, this isn't entirely the robot's bad.Still, it would be horrific to wake up with a metal mouth trying to suck your skull into its garbage-filled body. The woman, who was home alone, called for emergency help and the fire department soon showed up to free her from her robot maid's clutches.We've learned a lot here today. 1) If there's any hair on your floor, the Roomba's got your back. 2) If you have a Roomba, sleep with one eye open. Or just not on the floor. Maybe get some cinder blocks for that mattress.Update 12:15pm CT, Feb. 9, 2015: The makers of Roomba, iRobot, reached out to us with a comment on the story.The robotic vacuum cleaner that got tangled in the hair of a woman from Changwon, South Korea is not an iRobot product. The safety of our customers is paramount for iRobot, and all of the companyâ€™s products undergo strict development processes and testing before going to market. This includes safety mechanisms in Roomba that deactivate its cleaning system when it is not placed on the ground.
