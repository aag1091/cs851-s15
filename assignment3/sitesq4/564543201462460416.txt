BEACHWOOD, Ohio -- Beachwood voters rejected a charter amendment that would have limited the mayor and City Council members to three terms, and prevented controversial five-term Mayor Merle Gorden and four of the seven current council members -- Fred Goodman (who has served since 1992), Mark Wachter (1999), Melvin Jacobs (1998) and Mark Mintz (2000) -- from running again.Police are searching for two men who robbed the BP gas station in the 13000 block of Larchmere Boulevard at gunpoint, getting away with $113.47 cash and three cartons of Newport cigarettes worth $50. The same BP was the target of a September 2014 burglary when someone smashed the front window and hoisted an ATM containing about $760 from the store.Follow Uscleveland.com is powered by Plain Dealer Publishing Co. and Northeast Ohio Media Group.
