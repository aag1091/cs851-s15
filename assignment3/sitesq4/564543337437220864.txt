The Renaissance literally means "re-birth" and it was a time of transition for Europe not only artistically, but also politically, religiously, and scientifically. It is the link between the dark, scary Middle ages and the modern era we live in today.But if you've ever seen depictions of the baby Jesus of that era or art featuring children, you'll notice something odd. Most of the artists depicted babies as being not precious cherubs, but disturbing demon spawn.What did they think babies looked like?I'm convinced this is not a baby, just a small man still trying to lose his baby fat.Was it the artist's intention to make Mary look like she's been dead for 3 days?
