He now risks becoming the country's shortest serving prime minister in almost half a century.Australian politics can be a ruthless business. Mr Abbott was elected largely due to the infighting in the previous Labor government which saw the leadership of the country switch back and forth between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Tony Abbott now finds his own party plagued with similar internal squabbles.Mr Abbott has struggled to get much of his conservative agenda off the ground and the economy is beginning to falter. But bizarrely it could prove to be his decision to knight Prince Philip that brings him down.That decision is widely perceived as being the straw that broke the camel's back for many of the prime minister's one-time supporters.
