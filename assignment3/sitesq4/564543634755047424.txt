NEW MUSIC: Stream The First New Song From DEATH In 40 Years #SoundCheckOver the last few years, the legacy of punk pioneers Death has been re-discovered and re-examined. Though they only released a single 7” during their initial 70's run, the trio recorded enough material to fill 3 albums. The archival releases on Drag City, ...For the Whole World to See, Spiritual, Mental, Physical, and Death III have added context and depth to their legacy. The reformed trio (minus former leader, the late David Hackney) has been touring (including a blistering set at AFROPUNK Fest 2013) and working on brand new material. Reportedly, these songs are based on sketches written by Bobby and David Hackney in the late 70's. These brand new songs will be released on their first album of new material in 40 years in April. The fittingly titled N.E.W. will be released on the band's TryAngle Records, the same label on which they released their sole 7” in 1976. The first single from this new collection is the dub-inflected garage rock “Look At Your Life.”It's always inspiring to see living legends, be it Death, Prince, Madonna, etc continue to release music decades after their original contents mad it to the airwaves. I am looking forward to hearing their "N.E.W." Sound, they're dope to begin with so I do not doubt the new banger will be jive!
