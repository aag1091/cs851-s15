Horror Quote Of The MomentWelcome to Under The Morgue.We have sections for each decade of film, from the 1910s onward, as well as sections for 10+ major franchises, close to 50 'smaller' franchises (containing five entries or less), creative writing, independent filmmaking, photography, music, Non-Horror films and TV shows, forum games, and boredom busters, and to top it all off there's an IM shoutbox at the bottom of the page for random chat. From the tame and 'kid sister friendly' to the psychological and mindbending to cheesy splatter flicks to hardcore torture-oriented horror, there's something here for everyone, so why not dive in?You're currently viewing our forum as a guest.

If you join our community, you'll be able to access member-only sections, and use many member-only features such as customizing your profile, sending personal messages, and voting in polls. Registration is simple, fast, and completely free.Not to be confused with the "Best/Worst Of All Time" threads which will be up shortly, these are focused on various categories of the year 2014, ranging from "Best Picture" to "Best Cinematography" and so on. Think of it as the Horror website equivalent of the Oscars.Discuss upcoming films that are in development hell or haven't had any news released in a while. Note; these threads will be moved to either Upcoming Films when we get news updates or Cancelled Films if it's confirmed that they aren't happening after all.Here, each writer can create a Q&A thread where people can post questions specifically relating to that person's work in the entertainment industry. We already have a section for answering personal questions about 'everyday' things so please avoid straying into that territory here.
