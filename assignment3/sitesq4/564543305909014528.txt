He then jokingly added, “That won’t make the internet at all.”If you didn’t know, Taylor and John dated years ago and she wrote the song “Dear John” about him. Also, his on-again girlfriend Katy Perry is in a long-rumored feud with the pop star. Ironically, the main guest on the episode that evening happened to be Taylor‘s good friend Ed Sheeran!
