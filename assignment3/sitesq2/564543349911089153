YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS 
A. User Submissions 
The Site may provide you with the opportunity to participate in and post content publicly through chat rooms, forums, interactive features, or other communication functionality ("Community Features"). Additionally, you may choose, through such features or through submission forms or otherwise, to submit or post stories, photographs, videos, audio, questions, comments, feedback, suggestions or other content, (collectively, "Submissions"). 
You remain the owner of your Submissions, but you acknowledge that AKW must have a license from you in order to accept your Submissions. Accordingly, when you submit a Submission, you automatically and irrevocably grant to AKW an unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), assignable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use your Submissions, including without limitation, all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade identities, copyrights, trade secrets, logos, domain names, know-how, source code and object code, mask-work rights, inventions, moral rights, author's rights, algorithms, rights in packaging, goodwill and other intellectual property and proprietary rights whatsoever in your Submissions. 
B. Collaborative Works 
Creation of Collaborative Works. AKW may provide to you musical compositions, sound recordings, or stems ("Samples") through the Site that are designated by AKW as being available for you to manipulate, combine, or remix. A musical work (including the sound recording and musical composition) created by such manipulation, combination, or remixing of the Samples, together with any album art, metadata such as ID3 tags, and any other material connected with the musical work, is referred to in these Terms as a "Collaborative Work" or "Collaborative Works." 
License to You to Create Collaborative Works. AKW and, as applicable, its licensors, hereby grant you, solely for the purpose of creating a Collaborative Work, a non-exclusive license to copy the Samples and to create derivative works therefrom; provided, however, that you assign all right, title and interest in the Collaborative Work to AKW as set forth below. 
AKW's Ownership and Use of Collaborative Works. By using a Sample or any portion thereof to create or incorporate into a Collaborative Work, regardless of whether you submit such Collaborative Work to AKW, you hereby irrevocably assign to AKW all right, title and interest in and to such Collaborative Work, including all right, title and interest in the derivative work you have created, plus the constituent elements that are original to you. All Collaborative Works become property of AKW and will not be returned, and may be used by AKW in any manner, in any media, now known or hereafter devised, worldwide, in perpetuity. If this paragraph is found to be void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, you grant to AKW the licenses provided in Section 2.A.(2) above. 
Limited Purpose of Collaborative Work. You agree that you will not use any Collaborative Work or the Samples included within it for any purpose other than as provided on the Site when the Samples are made available to you, or otherwise make the Collaborative Works or the Samples available to or through any channel or means other than by uploading them to the Site or other platform expressly authorized in writing by AKW, as per the instructions provided when the Samples are made available. Any use of the Samples or the Collaborative Work by you not expressly authorized in these Terms, including but not limited to making copies, distribution, public performance, public display, and creation of derivative works, is prohibited and may be grounds for legal action and disqualification from any contest or promotion. 
AKW's Right to Edit and Revise. You acknowledge and agree that AKW will have the right to edit or otherwise revise each Collaborative Work for any reason, including without limitation, for creative reasons, for technical reasons, or to comply with any of AKW's obligations. AKW will have the right, but not the obligation, to publicly attribute a Collaborative Work or any derivative thereof to you. 
C. Terms Applicable to Submissions and Collaborative Works ("Contributions") 
As used in these Terms, the term "Contributions" will refer collectively to Submissions and Collaborative Works. 
Responsibility for Contributions. You understand that you are solely responsible for your Contributions, however submitted. AKW does not control the Contributions made available via the Site and therefore does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of Contributions. You represent and warrant that your Contributions comply with the Contributions Requirements set forth below and do not contain any content that: libels, defames, or invades or violates the privacy of, another person, or is indecent, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or threatening (in AKW's sole discretion); or infringes any intellectual property right of any entity or person, including, but not limited to, violating copyrights or trademarks or any right of publicity, or otherwise violates any law. AKW assumes no responsibility or liability arising from or related to any Contributions you submit or post, including responsibility or liability for any error, defamation, libel, slander, omission, falsehood, obscenity, pornography, profanity, danger, or inaccuracy contained in any information you submit or post. 
If you include personally identifiable information in public postings through the Community Features, you may receive unsolicited messages from third parties. Further, AKW cannot ensure the security of any information you post on publicly available areas of the Site. You understand that by using the Site, you may be exposed to Contributions or other content that are offensive or objectionable. Except as otherwise expressly described in the Privacy Policy , any applicable Additional Terms or otherwise on the Site, your Contributions, whether submitted via the Site or otherwise to AKW, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and AKW will not be liable for any use or disclosure to anyone, including but not limited to claimed intellectual property owners. 
AKW has no obligation to monitor the Site or any Contributions made available via the Site. However, you acknowledge and agree that AKW has the right to monitor the Site and Contributions you make and the right (but not the obligation) to delete, edit, move, or disable any such Contributions in whole or in part, subject to AKW's sole discretion. AKW reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Site at any time. Under no circumstances will AKW be liable in any way for any of your Contributions including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in your Contributions, any loss of your Contributions, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your Contributions. 
You agree and understand that the AKW Parties (as defined below) are not obligated to post or use your Contributions submitted through the Site or otherwise, and may alternatively choose to discard or remove your Contributions without any liability whatsoever. You hereby authorize AKW to publish your Contributions in a searchable format that may be accessed by users of the Site and the Internet. You acknowledge and agree that AKW does not have now, nor shall it have in the future, any duty or liability, direct or indirect, vicarious, contributory, or otherwise, with respect to the protection of your Contributions or any part thereof. You agree that AKW has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to any Contributions but has the right to protect and enforce its rights to any Contributions. 
Unsolicited Contributions. Please do not send unsolicited Contributions to the Site or any AKW Party. AKW does not accept unsolicited Contributions, including, without limitation, for any products or services. Please do not make any such unsolicited Contributions to AKW through the Site, including through Community Features, by e-mail, or otherwise. However, if you decide to make an unsolicited Submission, you hereby grant to AKW the right and license to your Submission as set forth in Section 2.A.(2) [LINK] above. If you decide to make an unsolicited Collaborative Work, you assign your rights to AKW in the Collaborative Work as set forth in Section 2.B.(3) [LINK] above. 
AKW's Right to Use Contributions. You further agree that AKW and its affiliates, including without limitation, direct and indirect subsidiaries, sister and parent companies, predecessors and successors to any interest, licensees, distributors and assignees, and the officers, directors, shareholders, agents, representatives, employees, and suppliers of each of them (each, an "AKW Party" and, collectively, the "AKW Parties") will have the unfettered right throughout the universe, in perpetuity, without any credit or compensation to you, to use, reuse, modify, alter, display, archive, post, translate, reproduce, distribute (through multiple tiers), publish, transmit, broadcast, display, disclose, modify, adapt, create derivative works based upon, perform (whether publicly, digitally or otherwise), develop, manufacture, distribute and use for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional purposes, any of your Contributions or portions of your Contributions, and your name, voice, likeness and other identifying information, in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now known or developed in the future for any purposes whatsoever including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing and marketing products. You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in and to any of your Contributions, even if the Contribution or a derivative work is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. 
Other Similar Material. You acknowledge that AKW may be working on or developing material similar or the same in nature to your Contributions and that AKW may have received similar or the same intellectual property rights from another party. AKW owes you no obligation with respect to your Contributions unless you and AKW enter a written agreement to that effect. If your Contributions are subject to protection under intellectual property rights laws, you are responsible for seeking and securing any such protection that may be available to you. Any discussion or negotiations between you and AKW regarding your Contributions do not constitute AKW's recognition of the novelty or originality of your Contributions. 
Contributions Requirements. When you contribute, upload or otherwise provide your Contributions to the Site, you agree to comply with the following requirements: 
Contributions must be your own. All Contributions must be created by you and you must have all rights in the Contributions; or, all persons who contributed in any way or have any rights to your Contributions, or otherwise appear in the Contributions, must have given you permission to upload and distribute the Contributions on the Site and elsewhere. Upon AKW's request, you will furnish to AKW any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms. 
No third party materials. Your Contributions should not contain any visible logos, phrases or trademarks or other third party materials. Do not use any Contributions that belong to other people without their permission � this means you absolutely may not include any content owned or created by someone else, including no uploading or copying of content you found elsewhere on the Internet without proper permission. 
Only you, your friends and family may appear in Contributions. If you upload photos or videos to the Site, make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know � but only with their express permission to post it. 
Original music only. To the extent a Collaborative Work you submit contains any materials other than Samples, your Contributions may not contain any music unless you wrote it and performed it. You may not use any jingles, sampling or other existing music, except as expressly authorized by this Agreement. 
Keep Contributions relevant. Your Contributions should relate to the content on the Site and should be intended to add to the discussion on the Site � they should not include irrelevant topics or postings. 
Follow codes of social decency. Cursing, harassing, stalking, and personal attacks are prohibited. Your Contributions may not threaten abuse or harm to others. Your Contributions may not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual preference or physical handicap or that are defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit. 
No Contributions that are violent, illegal or promote inappropriate activity. Your Contributions must not violate any law. Your Contributions may not promote any illegal activity and your Contributions may not promote violence nor describe how to perform a violent act. We reserve the right to take any action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion, including reporting you to law enforcement. 
Represent yourself truthfully. Do not impersonate any other person, user, AKW or other company. Do not upload or post Contributions that you know or reasonably believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, misleading or that misrepresent your identity or affiliation with a person or AKW or any other company. 
Keep private information private. Remember that Community Features are public and Contributions will be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not post personal information (for example, never reveal your passwords, phone number, address, email address or similar information). If there is something you do not want the world to see, do not post it publicly on the Site. Further, your Contributions may not reveal another person's address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number or any information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual or that is personal in nature. 
No Contributions for commercial purposes. Your Contributions may not advertise or promote a product or service. You may not use your Contributions to raise money for anyone or for a pyramid or other multi-tiered marketing scheme. 
Do not damage the Site or anyone's computers. Contributions may not contain viruses, Trojan horses, spyware or any other technologies that could impact the operation of the Site or any computer system. 
In cases where you feel threatened or believe someone else is in danger, you should contact your local law enforcement agency immediately. 
PROHIBITED CONDUCT
You agree that you will not, including by use of any robot, scraper, or other data mining technology or process, frame, mask, extract data or other materials from, copy or distribute the Materials (except as may be a result of standard search engine or Internet browser usage). Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you may not copy, reproduce, republish, modify, create derivative works of, upload, download, perform, display, post, transmit, distribute or otherwise use Materials in any way, without the prior written permission of a duly authorized AKW employee. 
You agree not to violate or interfere with the security of the Site, attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site, data, materials, information, computer systems or networks connected to any server associated with the Site, through hacking, password mining or any other means, or otherwise bypass or circumvent any measure employed to limit or prevent access to the Site or Materials. You also agree not to take or attempt any action that, in the sole discretion of AKW, imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load or burden on the Site or AKW's infrastructure. You further agree not to use the Site for any unlawful purpose. 
USER INTERACTIONS AND DISPUTES 
You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Site, whether online or offline. We are not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others, when you submit or post any personal or other information, and in all other online activities. 
COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RELATED COMPLAINTS 
You may not use the Site for any purpose or in any manner that infringes the rights of any third party. AKW encourages you to report any content on the Site that you believe infringes your rights. Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content. If you have a good faith belief that content on the Site infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please follow the procedures set forth below. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"), AKW has a designated agent for receiving notices of copyright infringement and AKW follows the notice and take down procedures of the DMCA. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide AKW's copyright agent (copyright agent contact information is set forth below) the following information required by the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 512: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyright work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe that any content on the Site contains content that violates your rights other than copyrights, please provide AKW at least the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (c) an explanation of what rights you own/have and why you believe the content infringes your rights sufficient for us to evaluate your complaint; and (d) accurate contact information for you. Please send (a) your notice of claims of copyright infringement on or regarding the Site, or (b) a complaint regarding alleged violation of rights other than copyrights, to AKW's copyright agent, who can be reached as follows: By email to: akw@ak-worldwide.com (with subject "AKW Copyright Complaints") By postal mail to: AK-Worldwide, 520 West 27th street (suite 1001), New York, NY. 10001, Attn: AKW DMCA Notices. 
We have a policy of terminating the accounts of users who (in our reasonable discretion) are repeat infringers. 
It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter. 
AKW will provide you with notice if your Contribution has been removed based on a third party complaint of alleged infringement of a third party's intellectual property rights. 
INDEMNIFICATION 
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold each of the AKW Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, investigations, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs (including attorneys' fees), or other expenses that directly or indirectly arise from or are otherwise directly or indirectly connected to: (a) your breach or anticipatory breach of these Terms, including, without limitation, any violation of the Contributions Requirements [LINK] of these Terms; (b) your use of the Site or activities in connection with the Site (including use of Social Features or Social Distribution); (c) your Contributions; (d) your violation of any law, rule, regulation, code, statute, ordinance or order of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; (e) information or material transmitted through your computer, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy or other right of any person or defames any person; (f) any misrepresentation made by you; or (g) the AKW Parties' use of your information as permitted under these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any written agreement between you and AKW. You will cooperate as fully required by the AKW Parties in the defense of any claim. AKW reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of a duly authorized employee of AKW. This Section will survive the termination of these Terms.

YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS 
A. User Submissions 
The Site may provide you with the opportunity to participate in and post content publicly through chat rooms, forums, interactive features, or other communication functionality ("Community Features"). Additionally, you may choose, through such features or through submission forms or otherwise, to submit or post stories, photographs, videos, audio, questions, comments, feedback, suggestions or other content, (collectively, "Submissions"). 
You remain the owner of your Submissions, but you acknowledge that AKW must have a license from you in order to accept your Submissions. Accordingly, when you submit a Submission, you automatically and irrevocably grant to AKW an unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), assignable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use your Submissions, including without limitation, all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade identities, copyrights, trade secrets, logos, domain names, know-how, source code and object code, mask-work rights, inventions, moral rights, author's rights, algorithms, rights in packaging, goodwill and other intellectual property and proprietary rights whatsoever in your Submissions. 
B. Collaborative Works 
Creation of Collaborative Works. AKW may provide to you musical compositions, sound recordings, or stems ("Samples") through the Site that are designated by AKW as being available for you to manipulate, combine, or remix. A musical work (including the sound recording and musical composition) created by such manipulation, combination, or remixing of the Samples, together with any album art, metadata such as ID3 tags, and any other material connected with the musical work, is referred to in these Terms as a "Collaborative Work" or "Collaborative Works." 
License to You to Create Collaborative Works. AKW and, as applicable, its licensors, hereby grant you, solely for the purpose of creating a Collaborative Work, a non-exclusive license to copy the Samples and to create derivative works therefrom; provided, however, that you assign all right, title and interest in the Collaborative Work to AKW as set forth below. 
AKW's Ownership and Use of Collaborative Works. By using a Sample or any portion thereof to create or incorporate into a Collaborative Work, regardless of whether you submit such Collaborative Work to AKW, you hereby irrevocably assign to AKW all right, title and interest in and to such Collaborative Work, including all right, title and interest in the derivative work you have created, plus the constituent elements that are original to you. All Collaborative Works become property of AKW and will not be returned, and may be used by AKW in any manner, in any media, now known or hereafter devised, worldwide, in perpetuity. If this paragraph is found to be void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, you grant to AKW the licenses provided in Section 2.A.(2) above. 
Limited Purpose of Collaborative Work. You agree that you will not use any Collaborative Work or the Samples included within it for any purpose other than as provided on the Site when the Samples are made available to you, or otherwise make the Collaborative Works or the Samples available to or through any channel or means other than by uploading them to the Site or other platform expressly authorized in writing by AKW, as per the instructions provided when the Samples are made available. Any use of the Samples or the Collaborative Work by you not expressly authorized in these Terms, including but not limited to making copies, distribution, public performance, public display, and creation of derivative works, is prohibited and may be grounds for legal action and disqualification from any contest or promotion. 
AKW's Right to Edit and Revise. You acknowledge and agree that AKW will have the right to edit or otherwise revise each Collaborative Work for any reason, including without limitation, for creative reasons, for technical reasons, or to comply with any of AKW's obligations. AKW will have the right, but not the obligation, to publicly attribute a Collaborative Work or any derivative thereof to you. 
C. Terms Applicable to Submissions and Collaborative Works ("Contributions") 
As used in these Terms, the term "Contributions" will refer collectively to Submissions and Collaborative Works. 
Responsibility for Contributions. You understand that you are solely responsible for your Contributions, however submitted. AKW does not control the Contributions made available via the Site and therefore does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of Contributions. You represent and warrant that your Contributions comply with the Contributions Requirements set forth below and do not contain any content that: libels, defames, or invades or violates the privacy of, another person, or is indecent, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or threatening (in AKW's sole discretion); or infringes any intellectual property right of any entity or person, including, but not limited to, violating copyrights or trademarks or any right of publicity, or otherwise violates any law. AKW assumes no responsibility or liability arising from or related to any Contributions you submit or post, including responsibility or liability for any error, defamation, libel, slander, omission, falsehood, obscenity, pornography, profanity, danger, or inaccuracy contained in any information you submit or post. 
If you include personally identifiable information in public postings through the Community Features, you may receive unsolicited messages from third parties. Further, AKW cannot ensure the security of any information you post on publicly available areas of the Site. You understand that by using the Site, you may be exposed to Contributions or other content that are offensive or objectionable. Except as otherwise expressly described in the Privacy Policy , any applicable Additional Terms or otherwise on the Site, your Contributions, whether submitted via the Site or otherwise to AKW, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and AKW will not be liable for any use or disclosure to anyone, including but not limited to claimed intellectual property owners. 
AKW has no obligation to monitor the Site or any Contributions made available via the Site. However, you acknowledge and agree that AKW has the right to monitor the Site and Contributions you make and the right (but not the obligation) to delete, edit, move, or disable any such Contributions in whole or in part, subject to AKW's sole discretion. AKW reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Site at any time. Under no circumstances will AKW be liable in any way for any of your Contributions including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in your Contributions, any loss of your Contributions, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your Contributions. 
You agree and understand that the AKW Parties (as defined below) are not obligated to post or use your Contributions submitted through the Site or otherwise, and may alternatively choose to discard or remove your Contributions without any liability whatsoever. You hereby authorize AKW to publish your Contributions in a searchable format that may be accessed by users of the Site and the Internet. You acknowledge and agree that AKW does not have now, nor shall it have in the future, any duty or liability, direct or indirect, vicarious, contributory, or otherwise, with respect to the protection of your Contributions or any part thereof. You agree that AKW has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to any Contributions but has the right to protect and enforce its rights to any Contributions.

AKW does not accept unsolicited Contributions, including, without limitation, for any products or services.

If you decide to make an unsolicited Collaborative Work, you assign your rights to AKW in the Collaborative Work as set forth in Section 2.B.(3) [LINK] above. 
AKW's Right to Use Contributions. You further agree that AKW and its affiliates, including without limitation, direct and indirect subsidiaries, sister and parent companies, predecessors and successors to any interest, licensees, distributors and assignees, and the officers, directors, shareholders, agents, representatives, employees, and suppliers of each of them (each, an "AKW Party" and, collectively, the "AKW Parties") will have the unfettered right throughout the universe, in perpetuity, without any credit or compensation to you, to use, reuse, modify, alter, display, archive, post, translate, reproduce, distribute (through multiple tiers), publish, transmit, broadcast, display, disclose, modify, adapt, create derivative works based upon, perform (whether publicly, digitally or otherwise), develop, manufacture, distribute and use for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional purposes, any of your Contributions or portions of your Contributions, and your name, voice, likeness and other identifying information, in any form, media, software or technology of any kind now known or developed in the future for any purposes whatsoever including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing and marketing products. You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in and to any of your Contributions, even if the Contribution or a derivative work is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. 
Other Similar Material. You acknowledge that AKW may be working on or developing material similar or the same in nature to your Contributions and that AKW may have received similar or the same intellectual property rights from another party. AKW owes you no obligation with respect to your Contributions unless you and AKW enter a written agreement to that effect. If your Contributions are subject to protection under intellectual property rights laws, you are responsible for seeking and securing any such protection that may be available to you. Any discussion or negotiations between you and AKW regarding your Contributions do not constitute AKW's recognition of the novelty or originality of your Contributions.

Contributions must be your own. All Contributions must be created by you and you must have all rights in the Contributions; or, all persons who contributed in any way or have any rights to your Contributions, or otherwise appear in the Contributions, must have given you permission to upload and distribute the Contributions on the Site and elsewhere.

No third party materials. Your Contributions should not contain any visible logos, phrases or trademarks or other third party materials. Do not use any Contributions that belong to other people without their permission � this means you absolutely may not include any content owned or created by someone else, including no uploading or copying of content you found elsewhere on the Internet without proper permission. 
Only you, your friends and family may appear in Contributions. If you upload photos or videos to the Site, make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know � but only with their express permission to post it. 
Original music only. To the extent a Collaborative Work you submit contains any materials other than Samples, your Contributions may not contain any music unless you wrote it and performed it. You may not use any jingles, sampling or other existing music, except as expressly authorized by this Agreement. 
Keep Contributions relevant. Your Contributions should relate to the content on the Site and should be intended to add to the discussion on the Site � they should not include irrelevant topics or postings. 
Follow codes of social decency. Cursing, harassing, stalking, and personal attacks are prohibited. Your Contributions may not threaten abuse or harm to others. Your Contributions may not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual preference or physical handicap or that are defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit. 
No Contributions that are violent, illegal or promote inappropriate activity. Your Contributions must not violate any law. Your Contributions may not promote any illegal activity and your Contributions may not promote violence nor describe how to perform a violent act. We reserve the right to take any action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion, including reporting you to law enforcement. 
Represent yourself truthfully. Do not impersonate any other person, user, AKW or other company. Do not upload or post Contributions that you know or reasonably believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, misleading or that misrepresent your identity or affiliation with a person or AKW or any other company. 
Keep private information private. Remember that Community Features are public and Contributions will be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not post personal information (for example, never reveal your passwords, phone number, address, email address or similar information). If there is something you do not want the world to see, do not post it publicly on the Site. Further, your Contributions may not reveal another person's address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number or any information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual or that is personal in nature. 
No Contributions for commercial purposes. Your Contributions may not advertise or promote a product or service. You may not use your Contributions to raise money for anyone or for a pyramid or other multi-tiered marketing scheme. 
Do not damage the Site or anyone's computers. Contributions may not contain viruses, Trojan horses, spyware or any other technologies that could impact the operation of the Site or any computer system. 
In cases where you feel threatened or believe someone else is in danger, you should contact your local law enforcement agency immediately. 
PROHIBITED CONDUCT
You agree that you will not, including by use of any robot, scraper, or other data mining technology or process, frame, mask, extract data or other materials from, copy or distribute the Materials (except as may be a result of standard search engine or Internet browser usage). Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you may not copy, reproduce, republish, modify, create derivative works of, upload, download, perform, display, post, transmit, distribute or otherwise use Materials in any way, without the prior written permission of a duly authorized AKW employee. 
You agree not to violate or interfere with the security of the Site, attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site, data, materials, information, computer systems or networks connected to any server associated with the Site, through hacking, password mining or any other means, or otherwise bypass or circumvent any measure employed to limit or prevent access to the Site or Materials. You also agree not to take or attempt any action that, in the sole discretion of AKW, imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load or burden on the Site or AKW's infrastructure. You further agree not to use the Site for any unlawful purpose. 
USER INTERACTIONS AND DISPUTES 
You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Site, whether online or offline. We are not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others, when you submit or post any personal or other information, and in all other online activities. 
COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RELATED COMPLAINTS 
You may not use the Site for any purpose or in any manner that infringes the rights of any third party. AKW encourages you to report any content on the Site that you believe infringes your rights. Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content. If you have a good faith belief that content on the Site infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please follow the procedures set forth below. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"), AKW has a designated agent for receiving notices of copyright infringement and AKW follows the notice and take down procedures of the DMCA. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide AKW's copyright agent (copyright agent contact information is set forth below) the following information required by the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 512: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyright work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe that any content on the Site contains content that violates your rights other than copyrights, please provide AKW at least the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (c) an explanation of what rights you own/have and why you believe the content infringes your rights sufficient for us to evaluate your complaint; and (d) accurate contact information for you. Please send (a) your notice of claims of copyright infringement on or regarding the Site, or (b) a complaint regarding alleged violation of rights other than copyrights, to AKW's copyright agent, who can be reached as follows: By email to: akw@ak-worldwide.com (with subject "AKW Copyright Complaints") By postal mail to: AK-Worldwide, 520 West 27th street (suite 1001), New York, NY. 10001, Attn: AKW DMCA Notices. 
We have a policy of terminating the accounts of users who (in our reasonable discretion) are repeat infringers. 
It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter. 
AKW will provide you with notice if your Contribution has been removed based on a third party complaint of alleged infringement of a third party's intellectual property rights. 
INDEMNIFICATION 
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold each of the AKW Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, investigations, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs (including attorneys' fees), or other expenses that directly or indirectly arise from or are otherwise directly or indirectly connected to: (a) your breach or anticipatory breach of these Terms, including, without limitation, any violation of the Contributions Requirements [LINK] of these Terms; (b) your use of the Site or activities in connection with the Site (including use of Social Features or Social Distribution); (c) your Contributions; (d) your violation of any law, rule, regulation, code, statute, ordinance or order of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; (e) information or material transmitted through your computer, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy or other right of any person or defames any person; (f) any misrepresentation made by you; or (g) the AKW Parties' use of your information as permitted under these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any written agreement between you and AKW. You will cooperate as fully required by the AKW Parties in the defense of any claim. AKW reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of a duly authorized employee of AKW. This Section will survive the termination of these Terms.
