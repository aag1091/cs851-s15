Hand painted recycled fabrics, vintage buttons and fibers give each one their own personality, plus bells. Comes with your first charm and the Whodoo legend. \n\nAll dolls are hand stitched using repurposed paint fabric. \n\n*******************************\n\nWhat is a Who Doo Doll?\n\nWho Doo Arts will like to clarify that the Who Doo Dolls (tm) are not Damnit Dolls. Who Doos and friends are pieces of Folk Art with a personality and purpose. (We had to keep explaining to people while we were doing art shows that the Who Doos are here to manifest your dreams and ambitions..not to slam up against the wall..we are so much better than that.) \n\nWe want to spread good Southern Karma and let people take a little of South Carolina love home with them. They are meant to be hung on the wall like a piece of art and each is one of a kind.\nThey are here to help you manifest your dreams by adding charms that represent what you desire. \n\nWho Doo Art Dolls are born in the South, from scraps of painted cloth, colorful thread and magnolia breezes. They are made from repurposed fabrics that have been painted or dyed. We do all the hand stitching on them and pay attention to each detail, like the button eyes and the appliqu\u00e9 designs. The Who Doos aren&#x27;t made in mass from a factory, they are done in generations of 8-10 and signed by the artist. It takes about 2 weeks to make a group of 10 Who Doos from start to finish. \n\nWhen a friend wanted a voodoo doll and we decided it would be better to manifest good karma for the person who possessed the doll. And not bring bad luck to them by having a voodoo doll. They aren&#x27;t meant to be used as toys, but as a piece of art that gives back. By sewing on charms that mean something for the doll&#x27;s owner, this will help to manifest what that person wants in their life.\n\n********\n\nThe Who Doo Doll Legend\n\nDown in the low country of the Carolinas, deep in the salt water marshes, just as the pink and orange sunset touches the white egret\u2019s wings and the blue crab\u2019s claw, you may \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky -- catch a glimpse of the Who Doos skimming across the water\u2019s surface to tease the splashing spotted trout, twirling to dance with the grumpy brown pelicans, or scuttling across the shell-encrusted sand to ride the hermit crabs.\n\nThe Who Doos are mystical folk, born of the love from a Southern grandmother\u2019s hand-sewn quilt, of wishes from blown dandelions, and the laughter of seagulls. Legend has it that long ago, when the low country was lit at night by simply stars and candlelight, that the Who Doos would dance on the soft breeze of sweet dreams and heart-felt wishes. \n\nOne midsummer\u2019s night, as the dolphins played tag in the moonbeams, a Who Doo named Suzie-Q smiled as she heard a kind whispered wish for a loved one\u2019s safe return from war. \u201cLet it be,\u201d she whispered. And so it was.\n\nSince that time, the Who Doos manifest occasional dreams and wishes from sincere folk of pure hearts. But take care, lest you wish upon a Who Doo doll, for our wishes can have consequences.\n\nDesigned and crafted in small batches of six to ten dolls per generation, Who Doo Dolls are native to the Carolinas. Each doll is uniquely hand-stitched from hand-painted up-cycled fabric and decorated with individually selected yarn, found objects, shells, and other trinkets. Find a Who Doo decked out with tingling bells or shiny sequins to keep away bad dreams or negative thoughts.&quot;,&quot;for_sale&quot;:true,&quot;image_url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2b8560dd9222f7b1ca1f978408c23968/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;menu_category&quot;:{&quot;token&quot;:&quot;0cab4912-2fa8-4af3-8709-f97969a09a8b&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Wootie Woots Who Doo Owls&quot;},&quot;variations&quot;:[{&quot;token&quot;:&quot;82222ed6-861b-42f3-adb9-581e3bbe7be3&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Regular&quot;,&quot;price&quot;:{&quot;amount&quot;:3500,&quot;currency_code&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;},&quot;ordinal&quot;:1}],&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;yellow-eye-wootie-woot-owl&quot;,&quot;is_unique&quot;:false,&quot;is_in_stock&quot;:true,&quot;shipping_cost&quot;:{&quot;amount&quot;:0,&quot;currency_code&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;},&quot;merchant_token&quot;:&quot;17DDDYV4CPKS4&quot;,&quot;visible&quot;:true,&quot;available_for_pickup&quot;:false,&quot;additional_images&quot;:[{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/fcad88698453694ec8bb0e7bd844feee/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;80c729b1-61d5-4db1-b68d-e00415ceab93&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;156c42ad-e1ad-4c9f-aa9a-8e01ae4a51b8&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;What can you do with a Who Doo?&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:3},{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/737f137fe2589a509af77c3f980cf669/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c8a7c1b6-80e6-45e5-a5f8-fe27fae13a4c&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;156c42ad-e1ad-4c9f-aa9a-8e01ae4a51b8&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Back of Wootie Woot Owl&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:2}],&quot;available_electronically&quot;:false},{&quot;token&quot;:&quot;41e92ed1-84e8-42c4-bb66-1ce83fcbf0e3&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kitty Doo-Yellow Eyes&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Buy the original  \&quot;Kitty Doo\&quot; Who Doo Charm Doll to make sure you get you southern karmic energy blooming!

Who Doos and friends are pieces of Folk Art with a personality and purpose. (We had to keep explaining to people while we were doing art shows that the Who Doos are here to manifest your dreams and ambitions..not to slam up against the wall..we are so much better than that.) \n\nWe want to spread good Southern Karma and let people take a little of South Carolina love home with them. They are meant to be hung on the wall like a piece of art and each is one of a kind.\nThey are here to help you manifest your dreams by adding charms that represent what you desire. \n\nWho Doo Art Dolls are born in the South, from scraps of painted cloth, colorful thread and magnolia breezes. They are made from repurposed fabrics that have been painted or dyed. We do all the hand stitching on them and pay attention to each detail, like the button eyes and the appliqu\u00e9 designs. The Who Doos aren&#x27;t made in mass from a factory, they are done in generations of 8-10 and signed by the artist. It takes about 2 weeks to make a group of 10 Who Doos from start to finish. \n\nWhen a friend wanted a voodoo doll and we decided it would be better to manifest good karma for the person who possessed the doll. And not bring bad luck to them by having a voodoo doll. They aren&#x27;t meant to be used as toys, but as a piece of art that gives back. By sewing on charms that mean something for the doll&#x27;s owner, this will help to manifest what that person wants in their life.\n\n********\n\nThe Who Doo Doll Legend\n\nDown in the low country of the Carolinas, deep in the salt water marshes, just as the pink and orange sunset touches the white egret\u2019s wings and the blue crab\u2019s claw, you may \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky -- catch a glimpse of the Who Doos skimming across the water\u2019s surface to tease the splashing spotted trout, twirling to dance with the grumpy brown pelicans, or scuttling across the shell-encrusted sand to ride the hermit crabs.\n\nThe Who Doos are mystical folk, born of the love from a Southern grandmother\u2019s hand-sewn quilt, of wishes from blown dandelions, and the laughter of seagulls. Legend has it that long ago, when the low country was lit at night by simply stars and candlelight, that the Who Doos would dance on the soft breeze of sweet dreams and heart-felt wishes. \n\nOne midsummer\u2019s night, as the dolphins played tag in the moonbeams, a Who Doo named Suzie-Q smiled as she heard a kind whispered wish for a loved one\u2019s safe return from war. \u201cLet it be,\u201d she whispered. And so it was.\n\nSince that time, the Who Doos manifest occasional dreams and wishes from sincere folk of pure hearts. But take care, lest you wish upon a Who Doo doll, for our wishes can have consequences.\n\nDesigned and crafted in small batches of six to ten dolls per generation, Who Doo Dolls are native to the Carolinas. Each doll is uniquely hand-stitched from hand-painted up-cycled fabric and decorated with individually selected yarn, found objects, shells, and other trinkets.

Who Doos and friends are pieces of Folk Art with a personality and purpose. (We had to keep explaining to people while we were doing art shows that the Who Doos are here to manifest your dreams and ambitions..not to slam up against the wall..we are so much better than that.) \n\nWe want to spread good Southern Karma and let people take a little of South Carolina love home with them. They are meant to be hung on the wall like a piece of art and each is one of a kind.\nThey are here to help you manifest your dreams by adding charms that represent what you desire. \n\nWho Doo Art Dolls are born in the South, from scraps of painted cloth, colorful thread and magnolia breezes. They are made from repurposed fabrics that have been painted or dyed. We do all the hand stitching on them and pay attention to each detail, like the button eyes and the appliqu\u00e9 designs. The Who Doos aren&#x27;t made in mass from a factory, they are done in generations of 8-10 and signed by the artist. It takes about 2 weeks to make a group of 10 Who Doos from start to finish. \n\nWhen a friend wanted a voodoo doll and we decided it would be better to manifest good karma for the person who possessed the doll. And not bring bad luck to them by having a voodoo doll. They aren&#x27;t meant to be used as toys, but as a piece of art that gives back. By sewing on charms that mean something for the doll&#x27;s owner, this will help to manifest what that person wants in their life.\n\n********\n\nThe Who Doo Doll Legend\n\nDown in the low country of the Carolinas, deep in the salt water marshes, just as the pink and orange sunset touches the white egret\u2019s wings and the blue crab\u2019s claw, you may \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky -- catch a glimpse of the Who Doos skimming across the water\u2019s surface to tease the splashing spotted trout, twirling to dance with the grumpy brown pelicans, or scuttling across the shell-encrusted sand to ride the hermit crabs.\n\nThe Who Doos are mystical folk, born of the love from a Southern grandmother\u2019s hand-sewn quilt, of wishes from blown dandelions, and the laughter of seagulls. Legend has it that long ago, when the low country was lit at night by simply stars and candlelight, that the Who Doos would dance on the soft breeze of sweet dreams and heart-felt wishes. \n\nOne midsummer\u2019s night, as the dolphins played tag in the moonbeams, a Who Doo named Suzie-Q smiled as she heard a kind whispered wish for a loved one\u2019s safe return from war. \u201cLet it be,\u201d she whispered. And so it was.\n\nSince that time, the Who Doos manifest occasional dreams and wishes from sincere folk of pure hearts. But take care, lest you wish upon a Who Doo doll, for our wishes can have consequences.\n\nDesigned and crafted in small batches of six to ten dolls per generation, Who Doo Dolls are native to the Carolinas. Each doll is uniquely hand-stitched from hand-painted up-cycled fabric and decorated with individually selected yarn, found objects, shells, and other trinkets.

Legend has it that long ago, when the low country was lit at night by simply stars and candlelight, that the Who Doos would dance on the soft breeze of sweet dreams and heart-felt wishes. \n\nOne midsummer\u2019s night, as the dolphins played tag in the moonbeams, a Who Doo named Suzie-Q smiled as she heard a kind whispered wish for a loved one\u2019s safe return from war. \u201cLet it be,\u201d she whispered. And so it was.\n\nSince that time, the Who Doos manifest occasional dreams and wishes from sincere folk of pure hearts.

Legend has it that long ago, when the low country was lit at night by simply stars and candlelight, that the Who Doos would dance on the soft breeze of sweet dreams and heart-felt wishes. \n\nOne midsummer\u2019s night, as the dolphins played tag in the moonbeams, a Who Doo named Suzie-Q smiled as she heard a kind whispered wish for a loved one\u2019s safe return from war. \u201cLet it be,\u201d she whispered. And so it was.\n\nSince that time, the Who Doos manifest occasional dreams and wishes from sincere folk of pure hearts. But take care, lest you wish upon a Who Doo doll, for our wishes can have consequences.\n\nDesigned and crafted in small batches of six to ten dolls per generation, Who Doo Dolls are native to the Carolinas.

Legend has it that long ago, when the low country was lit at night by simply stars and candlelight, that the Who Doos would dance on the soft breeze of sweet dreams and heart-felt wishes. \n\nOne midsummer\u2019s night, as the dolphins played tag in the moonbeams, a Who Doo named Suzie-Q smiled as she heard a kind whispered wish for a loved one\u2019s safe return from war. \u201cLet it be,\u201d she whispered. And so it was.\n\nSince that time, the Who Doos manifest occasional dreams and wishes from sincere folk of pure hearts. But take care, lest you wish upon a Who Doo doll, for our wishes can have consequences.\n\nDesigned and crafted in small batches of six to ten dolls per generation, Who Doo Dolls are native to the Carolinas. Each doll is uniquely hand-stitched from hand-painted up-cycled fabric and decorated with individually selected yarn, found objects, shells, and other trinkets. Find a Who Doo decked out with tingling bells or shiny sequins to keep away bad dreams or negative thoughts.&quot;,&quot;for_sale&quot;:true,&quot;image_url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/96fc956faf1f0cda936aacb75929cb1b/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;menu_category&quot;:{&quot;token&quot;:&quot;3c66b4de-5fed-4dd4-a237-65bbfb5607e2&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Pre order Doos&quot;},&quot;variations&quot;:[{&quot;token&quot;:&quot;b441be4d-9197-4b2e-a4bd-08f91ae80df1&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Regular&quot;,&quot;price&quot;:{&quot;amount&quot;:5000,&quot;currency_code&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;},&quot;ordinal&quot;:1}],&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;who-doo-dolls-reorder&quot;,&quot;is_unique&quot;:false,&quot;is_in_stock&quot;:true,&quot;shipping_cost&quot;:{&quot;amount&quot;:0,&quot;currency_code&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;},&quot;merchant_token&quot;:&quot;17DDDYV4CPKS4&quot;,&quot;visible&quot;:true,&quot;available_for_pickup&quot;:false,&quot;additional_images&quot;:[{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/d6e2d1f8f358a7d684b937db007618ce/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;652a4e32-4333-4f7e-a32d-d0f157a72200&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d58293cb-a866-404c-8907-e2dd93c0a9ac&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Who Doo&#x27;s at the Aiken Art Center in Aiken AC&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:3},{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/93691807e8a1033ec2d971684e6c0ada/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;7df573c1-c55b-4cbe-a5e0-c5ea3c0e5fd2&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d58293cb-a866-404c-8907-e2dd93c0a9ac&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;a fun bunch of Who Doos&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:2},{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/ddbf5977b5ad228e16f545c6776b8ac0/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d7d8da82-43ff-40f6-bbd5-7fe56c8513dd&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d58293cb-a866-404c-8907-e2dd93c0a9ac&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Display your Who Doo by hanging it on the wall, so you can see your charms!&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:6},{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/3d68e9059cf9ca0f86d0e671446786db/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;da728db3-090b-4b04-afa3-647bc13df32e&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d58293cb-a866-404c-8907-e2dd93c0a9ac&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Who Doos in the beginning&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:5},{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/75f2b7846111a6d8690d6f365e6a32d8/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ffc033e9-5250-47c3-9640-6ae415b3643c&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d58293cb-a866-404c-8907-e2dd93c0a9ac&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;April&#x27;s who doo&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:4},{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/d2c82c4b8eeaa0c17b0403f3c150d891/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;67d9c1b3-7e74-45a2-ba03-e86286c2d2b4&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d58293cb-a866-404c-8907-e2dd93c0a9ac&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Display your Who Doo by hanging it on the wall, so you can see your charms!&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:7},{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://square-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2bffbd0dcde227e4cc0ddc5e06cc40e4/original.jpeg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a436a6d1-5c0b-41af-bfe1-e9bf38a33152&quot;,&quot;item&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d58293cb-a866-404c-8907-e2dd93c0a9ac&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:{&quot;squareup.api.items.type&quot;:&quot;ITEM&quot;}},&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;What can you do with your Who Doo?&quot;,&quot;zoom_factor&quot;:0,&quot;ordinal&quot;:8}],&quot;ordinal&quot;:1,&quot;available_electronically&quot;:false},{&quot;token&quot;:&quot;5ab803e1-7a71-4d52-a902-11a0b8706e4a&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Yellow eye -Low Country Who Doo&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The original Who Doo Charm Doll has an Eye/ Sun in the middle of its body to represent being able to see into the future and bring the warm Sun of the South Carolina low country to you.\n\nThe Who Doo&#x27;s are 9\&quot; tall, hand sewn and hand painted fabrics.
