<p>Powerball's jackpot climbed on Sunday to $450 million, one of the biggest ever offered by the multi-state lottery, after the previous evening's drawing failed to produce any grand prize winners.</p><p>The winning numbers in Saturday's drawing were 5, 10, 21 34 and 58, lottery officials said, and the Powerball number was 33.</p><p>While no players qualified for the jackpot by picking all the numbers, ticket-holders won about $30 million in lesser prizes, according the Powerball website.</p><p>Powerball jackpots start at $40 million and grow until at least one player comes up with the winning number at a twice-weekly draw. The next drawing will take place on Wednesday evening.</p><p>The jackpot winners receive either payments over 29 years or a smaller cash lump sum. The cash option for the jackpot rose to $304.1 million after Saturday's drawing.</p><p>The biggest Powerball jackpot awarded by the Multi-State Lottery Association was $590.5 million and went to the holder of a single winning ticket in 2013. The association also operates the Mega Millions jackpot, which awarded a top prize of $656 million three years ago.</p><p>Game drawings for Powerball, played in 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are held on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 10:59 p.m. in Tallahassee, Florida.

You want to do a good job, but you don't want to be influenced by anyone. It's so personal to so many people. I have a lot of respect for the part. I have to go into a place where I can feel a very personal connection to the role. I have to start with a blank canvas, almost like starting from scratch as if I never heard of him before, as if I was meeting him for the first time. I really needed to see how I felt about him, to see how those words that he says touched me. I needed to feel vulnerable, human and be affected by the material. No one knows how he felt, how he was, what he did and what he said. So to actually look at all of that in a personal was very touching."},{"type":"div","html":""},{"type":"div","html":"<strong>NBC: Why do you think the topic of religion is making a comeback?</strong>"},{"type":"div","html":""},{"type":"div","html":"After 2012 there's been a shift in humanity, society and economics. We're witnessing a transition, everything is changing really fast - with that comes a wanting to see and believe, and faith and spirituality come into play. I think the world is now more spiritual than it ever was because people are searching for answers. Producers are realizing that people need this because there is definitely an asking for it. Also, the type of religious content being done today is different from what we've seen in the past. A.D does this beautifully. They are very gutsy and passionate. It doesn't shy away from the violence of the time and at the same time it has the epic factor and the heart. I think a lot of the times, biblical series have been quite family safe and in this case I think it's different because it's so gutsy."},{"type":"div","html":""},{"type":"div","html":"<strong>NBC: You are from Argentina and your last two TV jobs have been working in English - NBC's &quot;Camp&quot; and TNT's &quot;Dallas&quot; remake.

I spent ten years in London, I trained there. But because I started in English, it kind of feels the most natural to me, to act in English, which is a strange thing. My language is Spanish, I grew up in Argentina, I speak to my family in Spanish, but if you were to ask me what language I connect with, it'd be English in some weird way. Also, when I worked in Spain, I worked for four years in Spain in television and theater, they wanted me to be a Spaniard (laughs) so I wasn't able to use my accent which is Argentinian. Any accent that is different than your own you have to work for it, so speaking in Spanish for me professionally was speaking in Spanish with a Spaniard accent. So in a way, speaking in English is pretty comfortable."},{"type":"div","html":""},{"type":"div","html":"<strong>NBC: As an Argentine playing Jesus in an epic biblical series, what does it mean for you that Pope Francis is also from Argentina?</strong>"},{"type":"div","html":""},{"type":"div","html":"There is such a huge pride for all of us that he's the Pope, but not only that he's the Pope, but that he's actually a cool Pope.

It's a really well-written drama. Latin Americans will love it because we love passionate storylines, you can see that on television (laughs). Network television hasn't really done this before in this way; I think Latin Americans will definitely enjoy that because it is so close to our hearts."}],"summary":"Argentine native Juan Pablo Di Pace will take on one of them most revered roles an actor can play, that of Jesus Christ on NBC's drama series \"A.D.","mediaList":null,"breaking_news":false,"show_on_cover":false,"ads_enabled":true,"comments_enabled":true,"search_enabled":true,"native_ad":false,"copyright":"","cover_art":{"caption":"Juan Pablo Di Pace as Jesus  in \"A.D.
