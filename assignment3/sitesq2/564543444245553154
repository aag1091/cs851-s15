        back in July of 2014. It was great fun for a while but it was time for 
        me to move on and I am now I am shooting only what I love most of all 
        which is the type of traditional &quot;glamour&quot; photos and video 
        that I started out shooting back in the early 1980's. <b><a href="http://www.lady-sonia.com/">www.Lady-Sonia.com</a></b> 
        is now about the models themselves together with the style. Fully fashioned 
        nylons, pantyhose, bras, panties, corsets, basques, low-cut tops and dresses 
        and of course spike heel shoes and boots. <b><a href="http://www.lady-sonia.com/">www.Lady-Sonia.com</a></b> 
        is all about the models now, <i>&quot;for those interested in the exotic 
        not the extreme&quot;</i>. Will I ever shoot hard-core again? No, not 
        ever. It was fun for a while but now that I am at the point where I want 
        to have my fun in complete privacy (as and when and if I want) and I want 
        my site to be completely different. Just like when we started, my site 
        is about women who love to show off and be seen and aimed directly at 
        guys who want to watch and I am having more fun shooting now than I have 
        ever had before plus I also get to do something else that I love as well 
        from time to time and that is to be behind the camera myself. <b><a href="http://www.lady-sonia.com/">www.Lady-Sonia.com</a></b> 
        is now a celebration of very feminine women and together with photos and 
        video of myself we are also featuring some of my very special friends 
        and some brand new &quot;first time&quot; models and &quot;lifestyle&quot; 
        lady's as well so please do check my site out if this is the sort of thing 
        that you enjoy too :-) xx</font></p>

        Most People Don't Know:</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Well I started modeling with camera clubs back in the early 80s and quite 
        quickly moved on to professional modeling for magazines and things. Back 
        then it was still rather frowned upon to be a professional &quot;adult&quot; 
        model I suppose and the camera clubs had a list of girls who would model 
        so long as things were kept discreet. Being quite the exhibitionist I 
        really enjoyed modeling and showing myself off so I modeled for just about 
        all of the fetish and S&amp;M magazines of the time as well as several 
        of the &quot;top shelf&quot; mainstream adult magazines as well and it 
        was a LOT of fun BUT right back at the beginning I was briefly a &quot;leg 
        model&quot; for Pretty Polly and a couple of other hosiery companies and 
        had huge posters of my legs everywhere but I was really more interested 
        in the adult side so turned my back upon mainstream fashion modeling quite 
        quickly.</font></p>
