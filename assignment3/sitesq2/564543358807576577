    <p>Top Traders Unplugged is created for you, the investor, trader or research analyst. If you are looking to take your manager due diligence or investment career to the next level, Niels Kaastrup-Larsen delivers the information you just don’t want to miss. Just like the Market Wizard books brought some of the greatest traders to light, Top Traders Unplugged brings to you each week a current successful hedge fund manager or commodity trading adviser who shares their experiences, their successes, and their failures. Hear their views on investing, portfolio construction, risk management, research, how to handle the emotional roller coaster and what it takes to become successful and a market wizard. The principals of Dunn Capital, Aspect Capital, Campbell &amp; Company, Sunrise Capital Partners, Brandywine Asset Management, Chesapeake Capital, Estlander &amp; Partners, Amplitude Capital and many other Barclay Top 50 managers are just some of the names we bring to you. Each episode ends with unexpected questions and advice that will help you take the next leap in your journey.</p>

    While I can’t claim to have a lot of experience in trading and hedge funds, I did have a chance to listen to one of Niels first few episodes. I enjoyed the fact that he asked great questions and let his guests shine with the knowledge that they brought to the interview. Sometimes podcasts can focus too much on chatter without actually saying anything, but I thought this show struck a great balance, was to the point, and was educational. I’m looking forward to seeing how this develops and will be tuning in on any of the shows that cover the “101 topics.&quot;
