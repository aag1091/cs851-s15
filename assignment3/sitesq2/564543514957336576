										releasing a video</a> of a captured

										yesterday about this particular form of 
										savagery. It is thus worth noting that 
										deliberately burning people to death is

										in all sorts of other ways:</font><p>
										<a href="http://www.livingunderdrones.org/living-under-drones/">

										Death, Injury and Trauma to Civilians 
										From US Drone Practices in Pakistan”, 
										NYU School of Law and Stanford 
										University Law School, 2012</font></a><font size="5">:</font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="5">The most immediate 
											consequence of drone strikes is, of 
											course, death and injury to those 
											targeted or near a strike. The
											<strong>missiles fired from drones 
											kill or injure in several ways, 
											including through incineration</strong><a title href="http://www.livingunderdrones.org/living-under-drones/#_ftn3">[3]</a>, 
											shrapnel, and the release of 
											powerful blast waves capable of 
											crushing internal organs. Those who 
											do survive drone strikes <strong>
											often suffer disfiguring burns</strong> 
											and shrapnel wounds, limb 
											amputations, as well as vision and 
											hearing loss. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">In addition,
											<strong>because the Hellfire 
											missiles fired from drones often 
											incinerate the victims’ bodies</strong>, 
											and leave them in pieces and 
											unidentifiable, traditional burial 
											processes are rendered impossible. 
											As Firoz Ali Khan, a shopkeeper 
											whose father-in-law’s home was 
											struck, graphically described, 
											“These missiles are very powerful. 
											They destroy human beings . . .There 
											is nobody left and small pieces left 
											behind. Pieces. Whatever is left is 
											just little pieces of bodies and 
											cloth.” <strong>A doctor who has 
											treated drone victims described how 
											“[s]kin is burned so that you can’t 
											tell cattle from human.” When 
											another interviewee came upon the 
											site of the strike that killed his 
											father, “[t]he entire place looked 
											as if it was burned completely, so 
											much so that even [the victims’] own 
											clothes had burnt. All the stones in 
											the vicinity had become black.”</strong> 
											Ahmed Jan, who lost his foot in the 
											March 17 <em>jirga</em> strike, 
											discussed the challenges rescuers 
											face in identifying bodies: “People 
											were trying to find the body parts. 
											We find the body parts of some 
											people, but sometimes we do not find 
											anything.”</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">One father 
											explained that key parts of his 
											son’s burial process had to be 
											skipped over as a result of the 
											severe damage to his body. “[A]fter 
											that attack, the villagers came and 
											took the bodies to the hospital.<strong> 
											We didn’t see the bodies. They were 
											in coffins, boxes. The bodies were 
											in pieces and burnt.”</strong> Idris 
											Farid, who was injured and lost 
											several of his relatives in the 
											March 17 <em>jirga</em> strike, 
											described how, after that strike, 
											relatives “had to collect their body 
											pieces and bones and then bury them 
											like that.” The difficulty of 
											identifying individual corpses also 
											makes it difficult to separate 
											individuals into different graves. 
											Masood Afwan, who lost several 
											relatives in the March 17 <em>jirga</em> 
											strike, described how the dead from 
											that strike were buried: “They held 
											a funeral for everybody, in the same 
											location, one by one. Their bodies 
											were scattered into tiny pieces. 
											They…couldn’t be identified” . . . .<br>

										<font size="5">The Independent</font></a></em><font size="5"><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-fog-of-war-white-phosphorus-fallujah-and-some-burning-questions-515345.html">, 
										“The fog of war: white phosphorus, 
										Fallujah and some burning questions,” 
										November 15, 2005</a>:</font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="5">Ever since last 
											November, when US forces battled to 
											clear Fallujah of insurgents, there 
											have been repeated claims that 
											troops used “unusual” weapons in the 
											assault that all but flattened the 
											Iraqi city. Specifically, 
											controversy has focussed on white 
											phosphorus shells (WP) – an 
											incendiary weapon usually used to 
											obscure troop movements but which 
											can equally be deployed as an 
											offensive weapon against an enemy. 
											The use of such incendiary weapons 
											against civilian targets is banned 
											by international treaty. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">The debate was 
											reignited last week when an Italian 
											documentary claimed <strong>Iraqi 
											civilians – including women and 
											children – had been killed by 
											terrible burns caused by WP.</strong> 
											The documentary, Fallujah: the 
											Hidden Massacre, by the state 
											broadcaster RAI, cited one Fallujah 
											human-rights campaigner who reported 
											how residents told how “a rain of 
											fire fell on the city”. . . . The 
											claims contained in the RAI 
											documentary have met with a strident 
											official response from the US . . . 
											.</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">While military 
											experts have supported some of these 
											criticisms, an examination by The 
											Independent of the available 
											evidence suggests the following: 
											that WP shells were fired at 
											insurgents, that reports from the 
											battleground suggest <strong>troops 
											firing these WP shells did not 
											always know who they were hitting 
											and that there remain widespread 
											reports of civilians suffering 
											extensive burn injuries</strong>. 
											While US commanders insist they 
											always strive to avoid civilian 
											casualties, the story of the battle 
											of Fallujah highlights the intrinsic 
											difficulty of such an endeavour.</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">It is also clear 
											that elements within the US 
											government have been putting out 
											incorrect information about the 
											battle of Fallujah, making it harder 
											to assesses the truth. Some within 
											the US government have previously 
											issued disingenuous statements about 
											the use in Iraq of another 
											controversial incendiary weapon – 
											napalm. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">Another report, 
											published in the Washington Post, 
											gave an idea of the sorts of 
											injuries that WP causes. It said
											<strong>insurgents “reported being 
											attacked with a substance that 
											melted their skin, a reaction 
											consistent with white phosphorous 
											burns”. A physician at a local 
											hospital said the corpses of 
											insurgents “were burned, and some 
											corpses were melted”</strong>. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">Yet there are 
											other, independent reports of 
											civilians from Fallujah suffering 
											burn injuries. For instance, Dahr 
											Jamail, an unembedded reporter who 
											collected the testimony of refugees 
											from the city spoke to a doctor who 
											had remained in the city to help 
											people, encountered numerous reports 
											of civilians suffering unusual 
											burns.</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">One resident told 
											him the US used “weird bombs that 
											put up smoke like a mushroom cloud” 
											and that he watched “pieces of these 
											bombs explode into large fires that 
											continued to burn on the skin even 
											after people dumped water on the 
											burns.” The doctor said he “treated 
											people who had their skin melted.”</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">Jeff Englehart, a 
											former marine who spent two days in 
											Fallujah during the battle, said he 
											heard the order go out over military 
											communication that WP was to be 
											dropped. In the RAI film, Mr 
											Englehart, now an outspoken critic 
											of the war, says: “I heard the order 
											to pay attention because they were 
											going to use white phosphorus on 
											Fallujah. In military jargon it’s 
											known as Willy Pete … </font>
											<strong><font size="5">Phosphorus 
											burns bodies, in fact it melts the 
											flesh all the way down to the bone … 
											I saw the burned bodies of women and 
											children” . . . . </font></strong>
											</p>
											<p><strong><font size="5">Napalm was 
											used in several instances during the 
											initial invasion.</font></strong><font size="5"> 
											Colonel Randolph Alles, commander of 
											Marine Air Group 11, remarked during 
											the initial invasion of Iraq in 
											2003: “The generals love napalm – it 
											has a big psychological effect.”</font></p>

											today. My report for Fairfax Media

											</font><strong><font size="5">which 
											referred to the use of Vietnam-era 
											napalm, was ”patently false”, he 
											said. . . . </font></strong></p>
											<p><strong><font size="5">It was not 
											until US Marine Corps fighter pilots

											<p><font size="5">The pilots 
											described how they had dropped 
											massive fireballs they called napalm 
											on Iraqi forces as marines battled

											<p><font size="5">On August 4, 2003, 
											a Pentagon spokesman admitted that 
											”Mark 77” incendiary devices were 
											used by the US forces, which he 
											acknowledged were ”remarkably 
											similar” to napalm weapons.</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">The Mark 77s used 
											a fuel-gel mixture that was similar 
											to napalm, he conceded.</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">Asked about Safwan

										October 22, 2006 (“Israel admits using 
										phosphorus bombs during war in Lebanon”)</font></a><font size="5">:</font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="5">Israel has 
											acknowledged for the first time that 
											it attacked Hezbollah targets during 
											the second Lebanon war with 
											phosphorus shells. White phosphorus
											</font><strong><font size="5">causes 
											very painful and often lethal 
											chemical burns to those hit by it, 
											and until recently Israel maintained 
											that it only uses such bombs to mark 
											targets or territory. . . . </font>
											</strong></p>
											<p><font size="5">During the war 
											several foreign media outlets 
											reported that Lebanese civilians 
											carried injuries characteristic of 
											attacks with phosphorus, a substance 
											that burns when it comes to contact 
											with air. In one CNN report, a 
											casualty with serious burns was seen 
											lying in a South Lebanon hospital.</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">In another case, 
											Dr. Hussein Hamud al-Shel, who works 
											at Dar al-Amal hospital in Ba’albek, 
											said that he had </font><strong>
											<font size="5">received three 
											corpses “entirely shriveled with 
											black-green skin,” a phenomenon 
											characteristic of phosphorus 
											injuries.</font></strong></p>
											<p><font size="5">Lebanon’s 
											President Emile Lahoud also claimed 
											that the IDF made use of phosphorus 
											munitions against civilians in 
											Lebanon.</font></p>

										25, 2009 (“Israel: White Phosphorus Use 
										Evidence of War Crimes”)</font></a><font size="5">:</font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><strong><font size="5">Israel’s 
											repeated firing of white phosphorus 
											shells over densely populated areas 
											of Gaza</font></strong><font size="5"> 
											during its recent military campaign 
											was indiscriminate and is evidence 
											of war crimes, Human Rights Watch 
											said in a report released today.</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">The 71-page 
											report, “<a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/81760">Rain 
											of Fire: Israel’s Unlawful Use of 
											White Phosphorus in Gaza</a>,” 
											provides witness accounts of the 
											devastating effects that white 
											phosphorus munitions had on 
											civilians and civilian property in 
											Gaza. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">“In Gaza, the 
											Israeli military didn’t just use 
											white phosphorus in open areas as a 
											screen for its troops,” said Fred 
											Abrahams, senior emergencies 
											researcher at Human Rights Watch and 
											co-author of the report. “It fired 
											white phosphorus repeatedly over 
											densely populated areas, even when 
											its troops weren’t in the area and 
											safer smoke shells were available. 
											As a result, <strong>civilians 
											needlessly suffered and died</strong>” 
											. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">Israel at first 
											denied it was using white phosphorus 
											in Gaza but, facing mounting 
											evidence to the contrary, said that 
											it was using all weapons in 
											compliance with international law. 
											Later it announced an internal 
											investigation into possible improper 
											white phosphorus use. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">The IDF knew that 
											white phosphorus poses 
											life-threatening dangers to 
											civilians, Human Rights Watch said. 
											A medical report prepared during the 
											recent hostilities by the Israeli 
											ministry of health said that white 
											phosphorus “can cause serious injury 
											and death when it comes into contact 
											with the skin, is inhaled or is 
											swallowed.” <strong>Burns on less 
											than 10 percent of the body can be 
											fatal because of damage to the 
											liver, kidneys, and heart, the 
											ministry report says. Infection is 
											common and the body’s absorption of 
											the chemical can cause serious 
											damage to internal organs, as well 
											as death</strong>. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">All of the white 
											phosphorus shells that Human Rights 
											Watch found were manufactured in the 
											United States in 1989 by Thiokol 
											Aerospace, which was running the 
											Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant at 
											the time. . . . T<strong>he United 
											States government, which supplied 
											Israel with its white phosphorus 
											munitions,</strong> should also 
											conduct an investigation to 
											determine whether Israel used it in 
											violation of the laws of war, Human 
											Rights Watch said.</font></p>

										<em><font size="5">Boston Globe</font></em><font size="5">, 
										February 14, 2013 (“Girl in famous 
										Vietnam photo talks about forgiveness”)</font></a><font size="5">:</font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="5">The girl in the 
											photo — naked, crying, burned, 
											running, with other children, away 
											from the smoke — became emblematic 
											of human suffering during the 
											Vietnam War. Kim Phuc was 9 then,
											<strong>a child who would spend the 
											next 14 months in the hospital and 
											the rest of her life in skin 
											blistered from the napalm that hit 
											her body and burned off her clothes.</strong> 
											She ran until she no longer could, 
											and then she fainted. . . .</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">Phuc went outside 
											and saw the plane getting closer, 
											and then heard the sound of four 
											bombs hitting the ground. She 
											couldn’t run. </font><strong>
											<font size="5">She didn’t know until 
											later, but the bombs carried napalm, 
											a gel-like incendiary that clings to 
											its victims as it burns.</font></strong></p>
											<p><font size="5">“Suddenly I saw 
											the fire everywhere around me,” she 
											remembers. “At that moment, I didn’t 
											see anyone, just the fire. Suddenly, 
											I saw my left arm burning. I used my 
											right hand to try to take it off.”</font></p>
											<p><font size="5">Her left hand was 
											damaged, too. Her clothes burned 
											off. Later, she would be thankful 
											that her feet weren’t damaged 
											because she could run away, run 
											until she was outside the fire. She 
											saw her brothers, her cousins, and 
											some soldiers running, too. She ran 
											until she couldn’t run any more. . . 
											. Two of her cousins, ages 9 months 
											and 3 years, died in the bombing. 
											Phuc had burns over two-thirds of 
											her body and was not expected to 
											live.</font></p>
										</blockquote>
										<p><font size="5">Unlike ISIS, the U.S. 
										usually (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/24/iraq.usa2">though 
										not always</a>)
										<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30725189/ns/politics-white_house/t/reversal-obama-seeks-block-abuse-photos/">
										tries to suppress</a> (rather than 
										gleefully publish)
										<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/25/AR2010092500560.html">
										evidence showing</a> the victims of its 
										violence. Indeed, concealing stories 
										about the victims of American militarism 
										is a critical part of the U.S. 
										government’s strategy for maintaining 
										support for its sustained aggression. 
										That is why, in general, the U.S. media 
										has
										<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com.br/2007/04/truths-consequences-by-digby-since.html">
										a policy of systematically excluding and 
										ignoring such victims</a> (although 
										disappearing them this way does not 
										actually render them nonexistent).</font></p>
										<p><font size="5">One could plausibly 
										maintain that there is a different moral 
										calculus involved in (a) burning a 
										helpless captive to death as opposed to 
										(b) recklessly or even deliberately 
										burning civilians to death in areas that 
										one is bombing with weapons <em>
										purposely designed</em> to incinerate 
										human beings, often with the maximum 
										possible pain. That’s the moral 
										principle that makes torture specially 
										heinous:
										<a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article4292669.ece">
										sadistically inflicting pain and 
										suffering</a> on a helpless detainee is 
										a unique form of barbarity.</font></p>
										<p><font size="5">But there is 
										nonetheless something quite obfuscating 
										about this beloved ritual of denouncing 
										the unique barbarism of ISIS. It is true 
										that ISIS seems to have embraced a goal 
										– a strategy – of being incomparably 
										savage, inhumane and morally repugnant. 
										That the group is indescribably 
										nihilistic and morally grotesque is 
										beyond debate.</font></p>
										<p><font size="5">That’s exactly what 
										makes the intensity of these repeated 
										denunciation rituals somewhat 
										confounding. Everyone decent, by 
										definition, fully understands that ISIS 
										is repellent and savage. While it’s 
										understandable that being forced to 
										watch the savagery on video prompts 
										strong emotions (although, again, hiding 
										savagery does not in fact make it less 
										savage), it’s hard to avoid the 
										conclusion that the ritualistic 
										expressed revulsion has a definitive 
										utility.</font></p>
										<p><font size="5">The constant orgy of 
										condemnation aimed at this group seems 
										to have little purpose other than tribal 
										self-affirmation: <em>no matter how many 
										awful acts our government engages in, at 
										least we don’t do something like that, 
										at least we’re not as bad as them</em>. 
										In some instances, that may be true, but 
										even when it is, the differences are 
										usually much more a matter of degree 
										than category (much the way that angry 
										denunciations over the Taliban for
										<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/taliban-bomb-kills-attack-kills-11-afghanistan-28568243">
										suicide-bombing a funeral</a> of one of 
										its victims hides the fact that the
										<a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/">
										U.S. engages in its own “double tap” 
										practice of bombing rescuers and funeral 
										mourners for its drone victims</a>). To 
										the extent that these denunciation 
										rituals make us forget or further 
										obscure our own governments’ brutality – 
										and that seems to be the overriding 
										effect if not the purpose of these 
										rituals – they are worse than worthless; 
										they are actively harmful.</font></p>
