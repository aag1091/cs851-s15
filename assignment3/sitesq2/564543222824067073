Like deceived Roman Catholics, Buddhists claim and are taught that they do not 
worship Buddha, saying that they only “pray” to his statue. The truth of the 
matter (as you will see in the numerous photos on this webpage) is that 
Buddhists do bow in worship and praise of Buddha.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font face="Trebuchet MS">In Matthew 4:10 Jesus told the Devil, “Thou shalt 
worship the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thous serve.” The word “worship” 
here is the Greek word <i>proskuneo, </i>meaning “to kiss, like a dog licking 
his master’s hand); to fawn or crouch to, that is, (literally or figuratively) 
prostrate oneself in homage (do reverence to, adore).” By this very definition, 
Roman Catholics do indeed <a href="../Roman%20Catholicism/mary_worship.htm">worship statues of the Virgin Mary</a> and Buddhists do in 
fact worship statues of Buddha. Both religions denounce that Mary nor Buddha are 
God; yet they worship these historical figures as God. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font face="Trebuchet MS">
<img border="0" src="buddha_devil_worship_001.png" width="348" height="265" align="left" hspace="7">Buddhism 
is of the Devil, teachings for doctrines the commandments of men (Mark 7:9). 
There are an estimated 300,000,000 followers of Buddhism around the world.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font face="Trebuchet MS">This false religion is becoming increasingly popular 
in America because people will not tolerate sound Biblical doctrine anymore. 
This was foretold in <b>2nd Timothy 4:3, “For the time will come when they will 
not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to 
themselves teachers, having itching ears.” </b>Buddhism does not place any 
absolute demands on its followers. Buddhism tolerates all other religions, does 
not contend for its own faith, and fits in perfectly with the New World Order's 
homogenous One-World religion. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font face="Trebuchet MS">In fact, Buddhists are worshipping devils by bowing 
and adoring statues of Buddha. The Bible strictly prohibits worshipping or even 
the act of BOWING to any image of anything. We read in Exodus 20:4-5 (commonly 
referred to as the 2nd of the Ten Commandments), <b>“Thou shalt not make unto 
thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or 
that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou 
shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a 
jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the 
third and fourth generation of them that hate me.” </b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font face="Trebuchet MS">How much clearer could the Bible be? It is the sin of 
idolatry to praise statues and images. Those fools who claim to only pray to 
statues, but not to worship them, are in utter denial of the truth. Catholics 
commonly use the illustration of a picture of one's family that is carried 
around in a wallet or purse; however, I've never seen anyone praying to a photo 
of their loved ones. Catholics are LIARS, just as Buddhists are LIARS, just as 
the Devil is the father of all LIARS (John 8:44). Jesus Christ is THE TRUTH 
(John 14:6). </font></p>

<font face="Trebuchet MS">Here, from their own words, are some of the basic 
philosophies of Buddhism...</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font color="#00FF00"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font size="4">• 
	What is Buddhism?</font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
	<br>
	Buddhism is a religion to about 300 million people around the world. The 
	word comes from 'budhi', 'to awaken'. It has its origins about 2,500 years 
	ago when Siddhartha Gotama, known as the Buddha, was himself awakened 
	(enlightened) at the age of 35.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font size="4">• Is Buddhism a Religion?</font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
	<br>
	To many, Buddhism goes beyond religion and is more of a philosophy or 'way 
	of life'. It is a philosophy because philosophy 'means love of wisdom' and 
	the Buddhist path can be summed up as:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font size="4" face="Arial">(1) to lead a moral life,<br>
		(2) to be mindful and aware of thoughts and actions, and<br>
		(3) to develop wisdom and understanding.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font size="4">• How Can Buddhism Help Me?</font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
	<br>
	Buddhism explains a purpose to life, it explains apparent injustice and 
	inequality around the world, and it provides a code of practice or way of 
	life that leads to true happiness.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font size="4">• Why is Buddhism Becoming 
	Popular?</font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
	<br>
	Buddhism is becoming popular in western countries for a number of reasons, 
	The first good reason is Buddhism has answers to many of the problems in 
	modern materialistic societies. It also includes (for those who are 
	interested) a deep understanding of the human mind (and natural therapies) 
	which prominent psychologists around the world are now discovering to be 
	both very advanced and effective.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font size="4">• Who Was the Buddha?</font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
	<br>
	Siddhartha Gotama was born into a royal family in Lumbini, now located in 
	Nepal, in 563 BC. At 29, he realised that wealth and luxury did not 
	guarantee happiness, so he explored the different teachings religions and 
	philosophies of the day, to find the key to human happiness. After six years 
	of study and meditation he finally found 'the middle path' and was 
	enlightened. After enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life 
	teaching the principles of Buddhism — called the Dhamma, or Truth — until 
	his death at the age of 80.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font size="4">• Was the Buddha a God?</font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
	<br>
	He was not, nor did he claim to be. He was a man who taught a path to 
	enlightenment from his own experience.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><font size="4">• Do Buddhists Worship 
	Idols?</font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
	<br>
	Buddhists sometimes pay respect to images of the Buddha, not in worship, nor 
	to ask for favours. A statue of the Buddha with hands rested gently in its 
	lap and a compassionate smile reminds us to strive to develop peace and love 
	within ourselves. Bowing to the statue is an expression of gratitude for the 
	teaching.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font face="Trebuchet MS">In other words, Buddhism is an alternative religion 
for people who reject Christianity. Buddhism teaches that man's suffering is 
caused by his own selfish cravings and dislikes, and if humanity can change its 
way of thinking, than NIRVANA (a peaceful state of rest and tranquility) can be 
achieved amidst the problems of this world. It all boils down to mind control; 
but this does not address the wicked heart of mankind, which the Bible says is 
desperately wicked and deceitful above all else. <b>Jeremiah 17:9, “The heart is 
deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?” </b>
Buddhism attempts to reform the human mind, without addressing the sinful heart 
that cannot be tamed. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
<font face="Trebuchet MS">No wonder modern secular psychology gravitates towards 
this eastern religion. Modern psychology is rooted in humanism, evolution, 
atheism and heathenism. The concept of sin is not recognized. The need for a 
Savior, and the precious gift of eternal life offered in Christ Jesus are not 
recognized. Modern psychology attempts to repair the mind and heart through 
education, reformation and rehabilitation (or psychiatrists and all their 
drugs); while totally ignoring the spirit of man, which is “<b>dead in 
trespasses and sins” (Ephesians 2:1). Hebrews 4:12</b> clearly distinguishes 
between <b>“the dividing asunder of soul and spirit”</b> in man, and plainly 
teaches that ONLY the Word of God can accomplish this miracle. Oh that people 
would love the Words of God! </font></p>

	worship has always been associated with Satanism and the occult. Aleister

	Satanic power in this world. Church of Satan founder, Anton LaVey has also 
	written books on how to perform sex rituals and perform magick ceremonies to

	(Acts 1:10-11), and is sitting on the right-hand of the Father in Heaven
