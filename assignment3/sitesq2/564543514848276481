Bad and ugly, definitely.\nThere is also an extremely funny side – wry observations that brought humour into an otherwise bleak landscape which included chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant.\nAnd I think that says so much of how life is generally, and what makes Join Up Dots such a powerful concept.\nAre the bad times, the good times, and the good times the bad times?\nWho truly knows.\nBut what we do know is that we will learn more from the moments of our lives that challenge us, than the ones where everything goes our way.\nSo the moment when she was told the news of her illness, was this a complete shocker or had she realised that something was right?\nAnd has she been amazed by the support that blogging her way through this illness has brought into her life?\nWell let’s find out as we bring onto the show, to start joining up dots with the one and only Margaret Cahill", "title":"340: Margaret Cahill: Beating Cancer By Blogging To The World", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script></div>

The situations I was in helped me cultivate perspective, resourcefulness, and (most importantly) the power of choice.\nHowever, it was in college that my entire world really changed. Not because of the education I was receiving, but because of the devastating illness that I was diagnosed with at the age of 20. Seemingly overnight I was in excruciating pain, I lost a great deal of function in my leg, and I could barely get from room to room in my house, let alone get around on campus anymore.\nEssentially, my spine was deteriorating far faster than it was supposed to. And according to my doctor at the time, I had the spine of an 80-year old person, even though I was just a young college kid.”\nAnd that was just the start of what would become life mission. Starting with getting himself healthy, he learnt so much that he could then share with the world.\nAnd now being the founder of Advanced Integrative Health Alliance, a successful company that provides Wellness Services for both individuals and organizations worldwide, podcast host, and a dynamic keynote speaker life seems good…in fact very good.\nSo does he see people struggle in life as they haven’t had the good and the bad, so aren’t aware of what they can deal with?\nAnd would he like to go back in time and change anything that has occurred whilst on this earth?\nWell lets find out as we bring onto the show, to start joining up dots with the one and only Mr Shawn Stevenson", "title":"314: Shawn Stevenson: Rebuilding His Body And Reshaping The World", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script></div>

"description":"Todays guest is an author who has a story that really resonated with me when I read his backstory.\nIn fact so many of us will resonate with his tale, as it is one about unfulfilled dreams, held back, not by lack of talent, but lack of belief.\nAs he says \"There was a time in my life where I didn’t see myself as an author, perhaps just like you. I knew I had stories to tell, but I was afraid that they wouldn’t be good enough…that I would be a laughing stock among my friends if I tried to publish them. It was a couple of years ago, right after I had been unemployed for almost a year. We had wiped out our savings and were very close to going under. My son wanted to go to college and I couldn’t afford it. I felt like a failure.\nThen, a story came to me. I liked it, and when I started writing, it just naturally flowed. Pretty soon, I had a whole book written. There was only one problem—no agent would take it. I shopped it to agents month after month, and none of them were the least bit interested. Then I heard about self-publishing, but I didn’t know anything about it. I spent a lot of time researching it before finally deciding, “I can do this; I just need a plan.”\nEventually, my book was ready. I loaded it into Amazon, but then I panicked. No one was home, and I sat at the kitchen table, staring at the computer screen. Sweat glistened on my brow as I looked at the cursor, hovering over the little button that said “Save and Publish.” I wanted to push the button more than anything else in the world, and yet I couldn’t.\"\nIsn't that a fascinating point that anyone who has created momentum and success will understand.\nYou have done the work, you are proud of it, but scared stiff to show it to the world.\nYour dreams are there in front of you, but you don't want to take that final step that will slide the work over the top of the hill, where it runs away from you.\nWell now with a series of books flying off the shelves, he loves nothing more than helping other authors do the same, and create words that they will love and the world will want more and more off.\nSo what was it about the written word that had such a pull on him throughout his working life?\nAnd would he look back at himself now and like many others shout \"Just start....get it out there!\"?\nWell let's find out as we bring onto the show to start joining up dots, with the one and only Mr Chris Kennedy.", "title":"288: Chris Kennedy: A Man Who Pushed The Button And Never Looked Back", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script></div>

It was a difficult time, but thanks to the support I had with friends and family, I was able to overcome that time period. If I can help just one person feel like they are not alone, and that things will get better, then I will have accomplished what I set out to do.”\nAnd with a tour of schools undertaken, to speak about bullying she is taking action and inspiring youngsters throughout America to do things a different way.\nSo what was it about growing up in such a rough and tumble environment that has helped her on her way to Country stardom?\nAnd can she remember how she felt on those early occasions standing on the rodeo stages and the spotlight turning in her direction?\nWell let’s find out as we bring onto the show, to start joining up dots, with the one and only Josey Milner", "title":"284: Josey Milner: Singing Her Way To The Country Music Awards", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script></div>

The job and the stress were making me physically ill.\nAnd I kept on thinking “Am I really supposed to be doing this?” \nHave you thought the same thing in your life listeners?\nI know I have.\nBut its what we do when we are at this point that is the key thing to everything.\nDo we carry on at the crossroads, and keep on the path that we have always been on?\nOr do we do as our guest did and \"turned off the TV and start reading, traveling, and exploring other interests.

She knew that she needed more.\nAnd that came after the removal of an ovarian cystic tumor, and weekly visits to a many different therapists and medical practitioners.\nShe was gaunt, had zero energy, and felt helpless, so at the suggestion of a friend, she took a drastic step towards healing—booking a two and a half week trip to a remote Brazilian village and received psychic surgery from renowned healer, John of God.\nAnd that was the moment when her path changed direction and led her to where she is today. as an author, regular contributor for The Huffington Post, Master Success Coach, and Certified BodyTalk Practitioner.\nHer books include “The Quest: A Tale of Desire & Magic” (currently being optioned as a feature-length film), “Following Bliss,” and “Anatomy of the Heart: Love Poems.”\nSo does she look back on her life and see the dots joining up to where she is now?\nAnd is she like so many other people who are bemused when they now reflect on why it took so long to find their thing?\nWell lets find out as we bring onto the show, to start joining up dots with the one and only Heather Strang.", "title":"275: Heather Strang: A Lady Who Floats In A Bubble Of Positivity Everyday", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script></div>

Bigtime\"\nAnd as we see time and time again on Join Up Dots, our guest will find their path in life due to a situation that you wouldn't wish on anyone. But they move from the dark place into the light by perseverance, love, understanding and curiosity.\nBack in 1989, he has a phone call that changed his life.\nHe had been advised that his sister had been raped. What could he do to help? What could he do to support his sister?\nWell for two years, he struggled to deal with the rape and the effect it had on his life – both as the brother of a rape victim and as a male.  He transferred colleges – so he could be close to home and his sister during the trial. \nAnd once back home with his family, he saw the pain, rage and sadness his parents, relatives, and family friends were also going through.  The sexual assault of his sister had changed many people’s lives.\nAnd it was with this dawning realisation that an assault like this was as much based on lack of understanding of what is the correct way to conduct yourself with someone else, as it was a crime.\nIt was the worlds lack of understanding, of the other personal right of personal standards that was the problem.\nCould he change the mind-set of youngster, adults and anyone with a sexual urge to realise that there was a way of interacting with each other that wasn't happening.\nAnd over ten years, he worked, talked, discussed, reviewed and developed the \"Can I Kiss You\" platform, where he uses humour to break down the barriers of this taboo subject.\nAnd now he travels the world bringing his message to the world.\nAs he says \"\"I do feel the work is a calling. The traveling does not get tiring because I know I'm going somewhere to get the opportunity to open minds and inspire a new way of thinking.  I get the wonderful honor and opportunity to plant the seed for them to take care of and nourish.\"\nHe is an author, speaker, father of four and husband to his beloved wife, and now here ready to join up his dots, so its with great pleasure that I bring onto the show the one and only Mike Domitriz", "title":"199: Mike Domitrz: A Man Living A Life Worth Journaling About", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script></div>

    This podcast is fresh and timely. Everyday host David Ralph is having high value conversations with his guests; of which I am honored and grateful to be one of (Ep 5). The lineup of guests he's curating is top notch and to boot he's a phenomenal interviewer. It'd be pretty hard not to be inspired to live life to the fullest after listening to any episode.
