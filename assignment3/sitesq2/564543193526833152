I paint landscapes in a variety of settings, cities, cafes, pastoral, and through these paintings, try to express light, atmosphere and activity, in an unambiguous style which, whilst not abstract, is still contemporary. I also paint figures, preferring the nude form, and through experimentation I try to offer honest paintings that reflect feelings, personality, relationships and a sense of spirituality." name=Description>

              <h5>My name is Frank Callaghan and I  am a painter. I work hard at developing my paintings and I sell and exhibit on  a regular basis, both in the area where I live and further afield. <strong>I have had paintings selected for  exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. These paintings are marked  appropriately on the web pages.</strong></h5><h5>&nbsp;</h5>
              <h5>Through this website I offer  others the chance to view my work and, if they wish, using the feedback  facility to offer helpful comment and criticism. I also offer the opportunity  to purchase my work. Details of how to do this may be found on the gallery  pages, <strong>and I am happy to consider  sensible offers against the prices quoted on the web pages.</strong></h5><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h5>
                This site is a link between me,  the painter, and you the observer, or possibly a link between me and the  would-be collector. I am happy to paint pictures for the home, and equally  happy to paint art for the workplace; wherever there is a space that might be  enhanced by the personal touch of an original painting. I hope to offer an essentially  personal and contemporary touch for any potential onlooker or buyer.</h5><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h5>
                <img src="Images/artwork2.jpg" width="258" height="192" hspace="20" vspace="8" border="1" align="left">My painting is visual â€“ I paint  what I see: landscape or people. I like to explore form, colour and tone. My  style has become a mixture of photographic realism and post-impressionism. It  is straightforward. It is in general not abstract nor does it require  interpretation. My paintings fall into two main categories. In my <strong>Landscapes</strong> I try to express light,  atmosphere and activity. Hopefully they allow you to enter the picture and to  contemplate and explore the scene, whether a busy city-scape or a pastoral  landscape. They are intended to permit the viewer recall, if the viewer is  familiar with the scene, or maybe escape if they are not.</h5><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h5>
                In my <strong>Figure</strong> paintings and <strong>Portraits</strong> I try to be honest to the subject, and I like modestly to try different  techniques in order to allow the best outcomes to emerge. Through figure  painting I try to express feelings, personality, relationships and hopefully a  sense of spirituality.</h5><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h5>
                I look forward to your comments  and I hope you may wish to purchase my work or commission a painting from me. I  am happy to work from photographs if you have a favourite image, or I am  willing to work from a mixture of photographs and sketches of the subject.</h5><h5>&nbsp;</h5>
              <h5><strong>I am happy to consider sensible offers against the prices quoted on the  web pages. </strong></h5><h5>&nbsp;</h5>
