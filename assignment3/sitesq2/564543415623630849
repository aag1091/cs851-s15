One young lady, born and raised in the Northern parts of Caddo parish, had a dream to sing before nations. After the tragic death of her son, the Lord spoke to her and whispered so sweetly yet stern, &#8220;it&#8217;s time&#8221;. So, she immediately went to work; writing down and composing every note and word that was given. While sitting in the music room, intrigued about the vision, her family began to sing&#8230;.. this is where the promise began. Today, we are spirit led, holy ghost filled and don&#8217;t mind giving God Praise!!! It&#8217;s all or None!! For we are &#8220;Created to Worship&#8221;!!!</p>

				<p><strong>Who Is Recording Artist Christian Gill?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Christian-15.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5892" src="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Christian-15-300x300.jpg" alt="Christian (15)" width="300" height="300" /></a>Christian Gill age 17 is an 11th grade student at Mount Vernon High School. Singing since the age of 3 he aspires to share his life experiences through song.  Discussion of real life situation helps listeners especially his peers, get through life.  Every encounter that has happened in his life is a true testament that God is Awesome and why he remains humble.  One thing that Christian knows for sure is that with God nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Mt. Vernon, New York, Christian got his first solo part singing You Are My Sunshine at his Pre-K Graduation program at Faith, Hope and Charity Christian Academy.  From there he went on to cultivate his gift of singing in Church.</p>
<p><a href="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cj1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5893" src="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cj1-300x300.jpg" alt="cj1" width="300" height="300" /></a>Christian is a worship conductor and singing for him has so much purpose.  Everyone has gifts and talents.  Sometimes we take them places we shouldn’t.  But for Christian it’s import for him to covet his gift and use it wisely.  He believes that God has put a spiritual anointing on his voice to awaken those spiritually asleep and for deliverance and healing.  It is his desire that people will be inspired to bless and worship God through his music.</p>
<p>2010 Winner of Best Soloist at Disney’s Annual GospelFest, participant in the Mt. Vernon Arts &amp; Culture Council’s Save Our Youth Program, where his performance was described in the Mt. Vernon Inquirer &#8211; May 2012 Edition as “electrified the audience with his performance – drawing a standing ovation”, upon being amazed at his talents and skills as a soloist, Mali Music brought him on stage to sing with him. He has performed for NBA and Mt. Vernon Native Ben Gordon at the Senior Awards Ceremony, was First Place Winner at Amateur Night at the Apollo Stars of Tomorrow on April 25, 2012, most recently participant in the Listener’s Lounge in Dover, DE where Kefia Rollerson was blown away at his skills and has personally connected with Christian.  He is also the 2014 PrayzeFactor Youth on the Rise winner. Called to ministry at an early age, Christian continues to lift his voice and show young people it’s ok to sing about the Lord.</p>
<p>So what does God have in store next for Christian? The release of his first cd entitled My Identity.</p>

				<p><strong>Who Is Recording Artist Sabina?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sab1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5887" src="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sab1-200x300.jpg" alt="sab1" width="200" height="300" /></a>Sabina is an international recording artist, singer, songwriter and a passionate worshiper whose heart cry is for people to experience and draw close to God through the avenue of praise and worship.  Fueled with this passion and drive she shares the gospel message of Jesus…a voice with a yearning for all God’s creation to crave worship, return to real intimacy and reach out to their Creator.  Her unique blend of various contemporary styles creates a perfect fusion into intimate worship and praise.</p>

<p><a href="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cover_He-Reigns_Sabina_Front.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5888" src="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cover_He-Reigns_Sabina_Front-300x300.jpg" alt="Template 502 4 Panel Digipak SR" width="300" height="300" /></a>Her latest album release ‘<strong><em>He Reigns!</em></strong> is a MUST HAVE for all music lovers.  As part of the promo tour, her project was recently showcased by Dr. Bobby Jones on the <em>Bobby Jones Gospel Presents</em> TV show, WATC Channel 57 Atlanta Live TV and on the Babbie’s House TV Show’ hosted by Multiple Dove Award winner Babbie Mason.  Excitement continues to build with the title track gaining radio airtime, as well as additional TV appearances, as the message of hope and of God’s love continues to inspire all listeners.  ‘<em>He Reigns!’</em> perfectly fuses a contemporary style into an explosive album of praise and worship. The project also intricately merges beloved timeless hymns into a beautiful blend that is bound to capture all hearts.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey (Background /History):</strong></p>
<p>Sabina began singing publicly when she was 13 years old.  However, her passion for music and the desire to sing was birthed in her at the age of 9, where she was inspired and deeply impacted listening to gospel music legend Mahalia Jackson.  In her words she states <em>‘…a yearning was stirred up in me as I listened to Mahalia and I wondered what could possibly drive such a passion and purpose in life? &#8211; I longed to sing and at 9 years old I talked to God about it&#8230;&#8217;</em>   Since then Sabina continues to draw inspiration from gospel greats such as Andrea Crouch, Cece Winans, Donnie McClurkin, Micah Stampley, Michael W. Smith and Shirley Ceaser among many others.</p>
<p>The ‘He Reigns’ album is Sabina’s sophomore project.  Prior to that she released her debut project ‘Mekoso’ (I Will Keep On); an African, Caribbean and American blend of beautiful rhythms that are certain to move every person.  She has also since released an Easter single ‘He Chose the Nails’ all of which are original songs inspired by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Sabina emerged the 2<sup>nd</sup> Place winner of the 2012 Virtual Adrenaline Productions Vocal Talent Search held in Atlanta Georgia, an award which was instrumental in the recording of her Easter single.  In her words she states… `I had been praying for years about the song ‘He Chose the Nails’ but the cycle of events confirmed that this was the right timing for recording.  She recorded the single in 2012, driven by her passion to get the message of the cross along with the most beautiful love story ever told shared in song.  There have been testimonies of how this song has brought liberation, restoration and healing to listeners to the glory of our mighty God!</p>
<p>Sabina is continuing to share her heart and passion for worship by leading people into the presence of God and cultivating a deeper intimacy with Him as she continues on the ‘He Reigns’ tour.  Her calendar is up to date on her website (provided below) for all upcoming events.</p>

At the age of twenty-four he gave his life totally to Christ and has been sold out for Jesus ever since. Jason has sang on several gospel choirs, groups and praise teams; ministering the gospel of Jesus Christ and helping to get people into the presence of God. This is the reason that he was created! THIS IS HIS PURPOSE!! God has gifted Jason to write and sing songs that cross all boundaries and backgrounds. The thing that sets him apart from other singers/songwriters/composers/producers is that he is simply a worshipper that wants to please God&#8230;</span></p>

				<p class="font_8"><strong>Who are the Conaways?</strong></p>
<p class="font_8"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/w2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5863" src="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/w2-300x273.png" alt="w2" width="300" height="273" /></a>The Master’s Will Project, debut album of husband-wife team Dale and Carla Conaway, unites the musical influences of Baby-Boomers and Millennials to create a fresh, “new” sound. Sweet harmonies, fresh musical arrangements, and strong lyrics, make The Master’s Will Project Christian music at its best. As Executive Producers, Songwriters, and Co-Producers of The Master’s Will Project, Dale and Carla use diverse musical genres to inspire and uplift. Their new hit single, “Found A Friend,” does this by reminding every individual there is a “friend who sticks closer than a brother.” Written by Dale Conaway, “Found A Friend” features the incredible lead vocals of Nicole Wilder and Desi Raines. Stellar award-winning Lowell Pye and Latino sensation Daniela Barroso, 2014 AMCL (Nashville) award winner for her solo album (Secreto Lugar), are guest artists. The title cut, Master’s Will, is performed with soulful intensity by Dove nominated artist Charles Butler.</span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Music Director and Co-Producer for The Master’s Will Project, Sam Hosey Jr., put together a &#8220;blazin&#8221; band using some of the best in the business from Detroit, St. Louis, and Atlanta. Brother of Executive Producer Carla Conaway, and a professional pianist / organist, Sam’s distinct musical style adds richness to the music he plays. Four additional biological family members are background vocalists, creating the perfect vocal blend. The additional production added by Derrick Stevenson, CEO Producer Engineer of Puretonez Productions, along with several other multi-award winning musicians, give the songs on this album a full, fresh, cutting edge sound.  </span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/w1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5864" src="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/w1-300x243.png" alt="w1" width="300" height="243" /></a>Dale and Carla come from musical families. Both began singing at an early age in their church choirs. Dale, the youngest of seven, is a native of St. Louis, Missouri. A graduate of Tuskegee University, Dale began playing the piano and writing songs while in college. His wife Carla originally from Lansing, Michigan, is the second oldest of six children. She studied violin in school and plays piano by ear. Carla graduated from Michigan State University and began writing songs after college. In the early years, this husband wife team took their music to the streets in Detroit, St. Louis, Flint, and Lansing. They sang and shared God’s love with people through song. </span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Passionate about empowering people, the Conaway’s now serve as tutors in their local church GED ministry. Dale, a licensed, ordained minister and author teaches on Biblical Sexuality and relationships. Married 30 years, the Conaway’s currently reside in Atlanta with their three children. In 2013, Dale and Carla founded Master’s Will Music Publishing Company. Together Dale and Carla have written nearly 100 songs and are featured new artists in the upcoming March, April, and May 2015 edition of Power Source Magazine. As independent artists, they aspire to create “liberating music with a life changing message” to encourage and inspire. Dale and Carla believe the songs the Lord has given them will do just this. </span></p>

				<p><strong>Who Is Recording Artist Daniel Musgrove?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dm1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5852" src="http://rejoiceamericaradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dm1-200x300.png" alt="dm1" width="200" height="300" /></a>My name is Daniel Musgrove. I was born on September 2, 1970 in the Bahamas. I was the last of ten kids born to my parents Almada and Art Glee Musgrove. Originally from Freeport Bahamas, I came to the United States at the age of twelve where I attended Miami Central High School. Ever since a very young age,  I knew that I had a calling on my life but because I was very reluctant to follow my calling I started hanging out with the wrong crowd, which ultimately led to me  getting in to trouble with the law.</p>

I declared victory against alcohol and sin in 2008 and started my work for The Lord through song.  I write songs which are a direct reflection of my life and where he has brought me from. My hope and prayer is that these songs can be a blessing to everyone who hears them.  God bless u all…</p>
