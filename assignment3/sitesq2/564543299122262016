        <p>We know that putting on muscle often feels like a difficult and sometimes impossible challenge. At Men's Life &amp; Health, we've evaluated numerous muscle programs in an attempt to find the best one. The reason why most programs fail is because they impose unrealistic restrictions on your daily life. Some tell you to eat tons of protein while others emphasize the importance of carbohydrates. In either case, you have to make drastic changes to your regular diet. In this special report, we take an in-depth look at a new and promising trend that we think is easy to use and yields real results. </p>

Combine <span class="prolink"><a href="step1.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'ClickMap', 'Offer1', 'L5']);" target="_blank">Metaboost Testosterone </a></span> with <span class="prolink"><a href="step2.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'ClickMap', 'Offer2', 'L6']);" target="_blank">NO2 Blast</a></span> and you've created an automatic muscle building machine.</p>

        At Men's Life &amp; Health, we agreed to try the Metaboost Testosterone  and NO2 Blast stack for ourselves. For the trial, I wanted to be the guinea pig since I was training to be in a fitness competition and needed to burn fat and gain around 20 lbs of lean muscle. To try out the Metaboost Testosterone  and NO2 Blast I ordered a free trial of Metaboost Testosterone (available through links below). Although there are many muscle supplement offers available, I chose this site because they are one of the most credible and trustworthy suppliers on the market. While most muscle products use lower concentrations of the strength gaining extract, this supplier has one of the concentrated and purest products on the market. We at Men's Life &amp; Health agreed that this product would give me the best results for my test.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>The free trial bottle of Metaboost Testosterone  was delivered in a few days from ordering and with surprisingly inexpensive shipping. Metaboost Testosterone  is one of the most concentrated and purest muscle building products on the market. It was our shared opinion that this would give me the most accurate results for my test.</p>
        <div class="articleGraph"><span class="graphTitle"><u><a href="step1.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'ClickMap', 'Offer1', 'L7']);" target="_blank">Metaboost Testosterone Formula</a></u> has been clinically proven to:</span>
          (This is the first step in the process. This one is the hemo-dilator that builds lean muscle. It's completely legal, safe, and has none of the bad steroid-like side effects.)						
            <ul class="prove">
            <li>Enhance athletic performance and strength</li>
            <li>Pump more blood into muscles by expanding veins and capillaries</li>

            <li>Give muscles more definition and size</li>

          </ul></div>
        <p><br>
        Although we were pretty skeptical, we wanted to find out for ourselves if the supplements could do everything it claimed as we wanted to give our readers an accurate review. Most of the success stories we heard about combined <span class="prolink"><a href="step1.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'ClickMap', 'Offer1', 'L5']);" target="_blank">Metaboost Testosterone </a></span>  with <span class="prolink"><a href="step2.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'ClickMap', 'Offer2', 'L8']);" target="_blank">NO2 Blast</a></span> to achieve maximum muscle goals. The idea is that the <span class="prolink"><a href="step2.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'ClickMap', 'Offer2', 'L8']);" target="_blank">NO2 Blast</a></span> will help you lose most of the weight and gain energy while the amino acid supplement will take off the hard to lose fat and allow your body to burn calories more efficiently. After so many positve reviews, we chose to test NO2 Blast as our secondary supplement.</p>
        
        <div class="articleGraph"><span class="graphTitle"><u><a href="step2.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'ClickMap', 'Offer2', 'L9']);" target="_blank">NO2 Blast</a></u> has been clinically proven to:</span>
          (This is the fat burner and detoxifier. Now this is the key! Taking Metaboost Testosterone  in the morning and NO2 Blast later on really sped up my shred.) 						
            <ul class="prove">
            <li>Increase the number of calories burned</li>

        <section id="results"> 
          <div class="resultsTitle">These Were My Results - 15 lbs of Muscle In Just 1 Month </div>
          <span class="resultsSub"><img src="images/bulletcheck.png" style="border: medium none ! important;">Week One</span>
          <p> After 1 week on the new routine, I was surprised by how fast and dramatic the effects were. My energy level was up and I wasn't as hungry as I usually was. This is a welcomed side effect of Metaboost Testosterone  and its power to curb appetite. I honestly felt fantastic and best of all, I didn't have to change anything about my daily routine.</p>
          <p>On Day 7, I got on the scale (this new digital scale that measures fat and muscle composition) and couldn't believe my eyes--I had gained 3 lbs in muscle mass. But still I wasn't completely convinced. They say that in the beginning of some muscle programs, you lose a lot of water weight and gain a lot of muscle. I wanted to see if I would still gain this much muscle in the upcoming weeks. But it sure was looking up! I now weighed under 155 lbs for the first time in years!</p>
          <span class="resultsSub"><img src="images/bulletcheck.png" style="border: medium none ! important;">Week Two</span>
          <p>After 2 weeks of using both supplements I had more energy and was sleeping more soundly than ever. I wasn't waking up in the middle of the night or tossing and turning because my body was able to relax (a result of the supplements' detoxifying properties, I think). I also managed to lose another 7 lbs of fat, putting me at an unbelievable 150 lbs in just 2 weeks. I could also feel a 6-pack coming through, which my girlfriend loved. Hell yeah!</p>
          <p>At this point I started to put more faith in these muscle products as more than just a gimmick.</p>
          <span class="resultsSub"><img src="images/bulletcheck.png" style="border: medium none ! important;">Week Three</span>
          <p>After 3 weeks, all my doubts and skepticisms had vanished! I had gained 12.5 lbs of pure muscle and had lost 8 lbs of fat. All the fat on the sides of my stomach were completely gone. My stomach was so defined I finally had a 6-pack! These products are just amazing. I lost a ton of fat and the muscle gains are UNREAL.</p>
          <p>I still had a lot of energy as well. Usually around the third week of other supplements you tend to run out of steam. But with Metaboost Testosterone  and NO2 Blast my energy levels didn't dip. Instead, they remained steady throughout the day! I even noticed that my stomach was digesting food better, no bloating or embarrassing gas after I ate. </p>
          <span class="resultsSub"><img src="images/bulletcheck.png" style="border: medium none ! important;">Week Four</span>
          <p>After the fourth week, I was completely shocked by my final results. I gained an unbelievable 16 lbs of muscle mass since starting the Metaboost Testosterone  and NO2 Blast routine! Everyone at Men's Life &amp; Health wants to try the supplements now. In week 4 I lost 7 more lbs of fat on top of the 16 lbs of muscle I had gained. I was ready and confident for the fitness competition. I am definitely going to continue taking Metaboost Testosterone  because it produces consistent, amazing results and has so many other muscle building compounds which help with muscle memory and maintaining mass. </p>

  <p><br><br><b>In conclusion</b>, if you want to lose fat and gain muscle mass but are doubtful about the effects of this routine, you need to try it for yourself. From my own experiment for Men's Life &amp; Health, we can tell you that the results are real. We at Men's Life &amp; Health had our own doubts initially, but we were quickly turned into believers. After conducting our own studies, we are also pleased to see that people are really finding success with this supplement stack.</p>

        <p>My friends and I have all been waiting for the Metaboost Testosterone  &amp; NO2 Blast Muscle stack to hit the news. At least 5 of us have all done the combo diet and we all lost a bunch of weight while putting on serious muscle. This stuff truly is incredible and has changed all of our lives. Good luck to everyone who takes advantage of this wonderful opportunity. </p>

        <p> This stuff is amazing! My best friend James did the same diet and lost an incredible amount of weight and it super buff now.. i couldn't believe it and had to do some research on my own which is how I found this news article. I can't believe they are offering free trials! I know James spent something like $600 and was thrilled.. imagine how excited he would be if it cost her under $10.00. This is a unreal, thanks so much bro!! </p>

        <p> stand by these bottles. I tried this stack a months ago and I can't say enough about it. This stack helped me lose gain 18 lbs of muscle and it completely changed my life. (I have always been a skinny twig). I highly recommend this stack to ANYONE that's looking to put on seriously muscle FAST. </p>
