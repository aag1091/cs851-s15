        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        a slight turnaround from a year ago, digital album sales in the U.S. are 
        up 2.8 percent to 28.26 million in the first quarter, while overall albums 
        are only down 1.8 percent to 60.6 million, according to Nielsen Music. 
        That digital tally wrapped up 2014 down 9.4 percent to 106.5 million, 
        while overall sales dipped 11.2 percent.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While 
        some may point to Drake's digital-only If You're Reading This It's Too 
        Late for this reversal in fortune, digital album sales were actually only 
        down slightly at 1.8 percent on Feb. 8, the last SoundScan week before 
        the rapper's album came out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        addition to an uptick on the digital side, vinyl sales have continued 
        to climb and are now big enough to have an impact on the overall market. 
        According to the data, vinyl sales are up 52.5 percent this year in the 
        U.S. with 2.77 million units (quite the jump over the 1.82 million scanned 
        in the first quarter of 2014).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Last 
        year's best-selling title, Taylor Swift's 1989, topped the first quarter 
        with 949,000 scans and was also the biggest vinyl album with nearly 19,000 
        units. Swift is followed by Drake with 793,000 all-digital units, easily 
        making it the quarter's best-selling album in that format. The top digital 
        song was Mark Ronson's &quot;Uptown Funk!,&quot; featuring Bruno Mars, 
        which scanned 3.7 million units.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Universal 
        Music Group remains the top U.S. distributor with a 39.4 percent market 
        share in albums, plus track equivalent albums. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        our chart, indie market share is listed at only 13.1 percent, owing to 
        the fact that market shares of major-owned indie distributors have been 
        included within their major label parents. Billboard calculates market 
        share by label ownership twice per year; in that view, the indie sector 
        accounts for roughly 35 percent of the market. <font size="1">Source:

        SIR MICHAEL ROCKS QUITS RAP FOR NATURE SHOW ON NAT GEO.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Having 
        earned a reputation as a wildlife advocate and lover of nature, it should 
        come as no surprise that Sir Michael Rocks has announced his retirement 
        from rap after landing his own reality series, The Rocks Report, on National 
        Geographic. Upon moving to Miami in 2013, the Cool Kids rapper adopted 
        a baby monkey, and a few months ago advised Buzzfeed of &quot;13 Beasties 
        That Would Make Great Besties.&quot; Sir Michael Rocks also teamed up 
        with PETA in their protests of SeaWorld, as MTV reported he &quot;was 
        serious about going to war for the whales.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        the pilot episode of The Rocks Report, National Geographic follows Sir 
        Michael Rocks as he navigates some of Florida's most populated wildlife 
        reserves. Venturing into a monkey jungle to &quot;hang out with some of 
        the locals,&quot; Sir Michael Rocks asserts himself into the monkey hierarchy, 
        getting up close and personal as he displays his expertise in handling. 
        &quot;I would just like to thank Nat Geo for helping create this experience,&quot; 
        Rocks expressed with full enthusiasm for a new chapter in his career. 
        &quot;As a long time animal lover and researcher I am honored to have 
        an institution such as National Geographic believe in me and help push 
        this portion of my career forward. This will be a fun ride and I can't 
        wait for the world to watch.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Growing 
        up as the youngest of three in his family outside of Chicago, Sir Michael 
        Rocks developed a lifelong interest in the outdoors. Nature looms as an 
        influence in his music, as Rocks infused the creativity, strength, and 
        beauty he found in settings like the beach, the deep sea, and the woods 
        into his art. Rocks' 2014 album, Banco, saw a quick rise to the #1 spot 
        on iTunes' hip-hop charts, also reaching the top spot on Billboard's HeatSeekers 
        chart. The album evokes Rocks' wealth of creativity, passion, intellect, 
        and style, all elements of his unmistakable persona soon to hit television 
        screens.</font></p>

        the Henchman&quot; Rosemond was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison plus

        and &quot;vile.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        federal judge imposed the sentence on James &quot;Jimmy the Henchman&quot; 
        Rosemond, who was found guilty at a December trial in Manhattan.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Rosemond 
        was convicted for his role in ordering a crew of men to kill an associate 
        of G-Unit. The charges stemmed from the 2009 shooting death of Lowell 
        Fletcher. Prosecutors had said the killing was payback for an assault 
        on Rosemond's son by Fletcher and other G-Unit associates. They said the 
        son was not seriously injured in the assault and Fletcher served prison 
        time for his involvement in it. Upon Fletcher's release from prison, though, 
        he was killed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Rosemond, 
        who has represented artists such as The Game and Sean Kingston, already 
        was serving a life sentence for smuggling cocaine in music equipment cases 
        between studios in New York and Los Angeles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">U.S. 
        Attorney Preet Bharara said Rosemond bragged to an associate after the 
        killing that he would never be caught because Fletcher was merely a &quot;gangbanger&quot; 
        who died in the Bronx.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;This 
        prosecution has proven Rosemond wrong,&quot; Bharara said in a news release.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        announcing the sentence, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon called Rosemond's 
        conduct &quot;heinous,&quot; ''vile&quot; and &quot;disgusting.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Evidence 
        at trial revealed Rosemond to be head of Czar Entertainment, a rap music

        organization, prosecutors said.</font></p>

        BROWN COURT DRAMA WITH RIHANNA IS OFFICIALLY OVER.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Chris 
        Brown has finally put his 2009 attack on Rihanna behind him, at least 
        legally.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Superior 
        Court Judge James R. Brandlin ended Brown's felony probation on Friday, 
        more than six years after the R&amp;B singer brutally attacked his then-girlfriend 
        hours before the Grammy Awards.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        attack erased Brown's squeaky clean image, which he has failed to regain 
        in the ensuing years after incidents such as throwing a chair through 
        a window after a contentious &quot;Good Morning America&quot; interview 
        and a parking lot brawl with singer Frank Ocean. Brown's career has partially 
        rebounded, with the singer performing at the 2012 Grammy Awards and winning 
        a trophy for best R&amp;B album.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brandlin's 
        decision marks the first time since mid-2009 that Brown will not be under 
        the supervision of court or probation officials. The singer initially 
        avoided problems with the case, but since 2013 has struggled to complete 
        his community service obligations and had his probation revoked in January 
        after he performed a show in Northern California without permission.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown 
        and his attorney Mark Geragos hugged in the courtroom and again in a courthouse 
        elevator. After the hearing, he tweeted, &quot;IM OFF PROBATION!!!!!!!! 
        Thank the Lord!!!!!!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        case forced Brown, 25, to confront some deep personal issues: he says 
        he witnessed domestic violence as a child and while in rehab, he was diagnosed 
        as bipolar, a condition exacerbated by his frequent marijuana use.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        singer has alternated between appearing contrite and polite in court to 
        defiant and angry on social media and in public appearances. Although 
        he maintains a sizable and supportive fan base, known as team breezy, 
        the case has stunted his career.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        February, Canadian immigration officials refused to allow him into the 
        country, forcing him to cancel two shows, and British officials blocked 
        his entry in 2010 forcing the cancellation of four performances.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        singer lost several months of his touring schedule last year dealing with 
        repercussion from a fight in Washington, D.C., and issues he encountered 
        in rehab.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I 
        couldn't be more delighted,&quot; Geragos said after the hearing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;He 
        is in a spot right now and a place right now that I couldn't be prouder 
        of him,&quot; Geragos said of Brown. He said Friday's hearing was &quot;a 
        monumental feat for him.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Problems 
        began in 2013 after prosecutors questioned whether he had complied with 
        the terms of his community labor sentence and Brandlin briefly revoked 
        his probation in a hit-and-run case filed against the singer over a fender 
        bender.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Later 
        that year, Brown struck a man outside a Washington hotel and was charged 
        with misdemeanor assault. Brown was ordered into rehab but was dismissed 
        from the facility for violating its rules and spent two-and-a-half months 
        in custody, with U.S. marshals shuttling him between Los Angeles and the 
        nation's capital for court hearings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        another incident while in treatment, Brown threw a brick at his mother's 
        car following a counseling session. The incidents occurred after Brown 
        had completed court-ordered anger management sessions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown 
        missed the January deadline to complete his community labor sentence, 
        which required him to perform manual labor such as roadside cleanup or 
        graffiti removal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown 
        was 19 years old when he attacked Rihanna in a rented sports car after 
        leaving a pre-Grammy Awards party. Brown fled the scene but turned himself 
        in to police hours later and was subsequently charged with felony assault.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Celebrity 
        website TMZ posted a photo of Rihanna's battered face, showing extensive 
        injuries that a detective described in detail in a search warrant affidavit 
        seeking phone records from both singers. Brown repeatedly punched Rihanna, 
        bit her ear and choked her to the point that she nearly lost consciousness, 
        according to the affidavit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown 
        pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009 and was ordered to stay 
        away from Rihanna, although the order was later lifted and the pair rekindled 
        their romance. They've since broken up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        singers have collaborated on at least three songs together since the 2009 
        altercation, including the aptly titled &quot;Nobody's Business&quot; 
        from Rihanna's last album, 2012's Grammy-winning &quot;Unapologetic.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
        part of his sentence, Brown was required to undergo domestic violence 
        counseling. Brandlin also ordered Brown into rehab, which resulted in 
        the singer being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress 
        disorder and complications from substance abuse.<br>

        a wide-ranging interview Friday with his manager Ted Chung in Austin, 
        Texas, 43-year-old Snoop discussed topics from getting high with Willie 
        Nelson to meeting Dr. Dre.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Here's

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        chicken was fried, but Snoop and Willie Nelson were baked.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Snoop 
        and Nelson collaborated on the song &quot;My Medicine&quot; and he said 
        &quot;it was love at first sight.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We 
        went in the green room, had a conversation and from there the conversation 
        sparked up the idea of &#151; yeah sparked up the idea of &#151; me and 
        Willie wanting to collaborate,&quot; he said as the audience at the Austin 
        Convention Center burst into laughter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Snoop 
        went to Amsterdam, where Nelson was on tour, and worked on the track. 
        After smoking so much marijuana, they decided to get food.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;They 
        give us the bucket of chicken, we open it up, boom, and me and Willie 
        stuck our hands in at the same time and we grabbed the same piece of chicken,&quot; 
        he said, as the audience laughed again. &quot;And I look at Willie, I 
        was like, 'That's you dog, my bad.'</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;That 
        was one of the greatest moments in my life.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>WHO 
        NEEDS A GRAMMY?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Though 
        Snoop has had platinum-plus albums and hit songs, he's never won a Grammy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But 
        he says he's not worried about winning awards, thanks to his youth football 
        league. He said he's proud he has been able to send young men to Division 
        I schools to play sports and gain an education.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;That's 
        better than a Grammy right there,&quot; he said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
        also said his proudest moment was seeing his son, who earned a football 
        scholarship to UCLA, go to college.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;He's 
        first person in my family to actually go to college, so how do you think 
        I feel?&quot; he asked.</font></p>

        said Dre heard some of his music at a party and then called the young 
        rapper to collaborate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Dr. 
        Dre was like, 'Who was that rapping?&quot; he recalled. &quot;From that 
        day he called me and I didn't believe it, I was like, 'Man, quit playing.' 
        I hung up on him.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Dre 
        called Snoop back and they went on to produce rap classics, from &quot;Gin

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;They 
        went to Congress, Dionne Warwick and a bunch of people had my record on 
        display talking about, 'He's the worst thing in the world,' and they were

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;And 
        I had to get past that because you have to understand, a lot of these

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Snoop

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It 
        rubbed me the wrong way and I was young and ambitious and gangster ... 
        but as a man now, I don't do that. I look at what they did, how they rubbed 
        me the wrong way and I try not to rub my young homies the wrong way. I 
        try to be for them and about them, and understand them and talk to them

        a standard-setting finale to its first season reaching 17.6 million viewers, 
        Fox's music business drama &quot;Empire&quot; has proven that it's still 
        possible for broadcast television to create big hits.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That's 
        how many people watched the second of two one-hour episodes on Wednesday 
        night. The first hour was seen by 15.8 million people, the Nielsen company 
        said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
        &quot;Empire&quot; debuted in January, its first-night audience was a 
        healthy but not remarkable 9.9 million. It proceeded to gain viewers for 
        every single succeeding episode through the 12th and final one Wednesday 
        night, a feat Nielsen said is unmatched in two dozen years of estimating 
        viewership through electronic people meters.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On 
        the final episode, music family patriarch Lucious Lyon, played by actor 
        Terrence Howard, learns that he doesn't actually have ALS as he had thought. 
        He also anoints middle son Jamal as the heir to the family business, angering 
        his other sons Andre and Hakeem in the process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Not 
        since &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot; in 2005 has a television drama reached 
        so many people for the last episode of its premiere season, Nielsen said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        viewership estimate doesn't take into account the number of people who 
        will see the show via Internet streams, video on demand and on DVR in 
        the coming days and weeks. Based on viewership gains seen by past &quot;Empire&quot; 
        episodes, Fox estimates that in a month's time more than 27 million people 
        will have watched Wednesday's last episode.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Facebook 
        said some 4.2 million people accounted for 15.8 million posts, shares 
        and comments on the finale.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        &quot;Empire&quot; success puts the rookie show among CBS' &quot;NCIS&quot; 
        and AMC's &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; in drama popularity this season. 
        It's a boon for Fox, which has seen former juggernaut &quot;American Idol&quot; 
        continue to recede in popularity and few other shows connecting with viewers. 
        It's heartening for television programmers in general to see a program 
        become a hit at a time most new programs fail.</font></p>

        SIMMONS ON DECK WITH MUSICAL.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hip-hop 
        pioneer, Tony Award-winning producer and multi-hyphenate entrepreneur 
        Russell Simmons has announced the development of The Scenario, a new stage 
        musical that will be driven by the music that defined a generation: the 
        greatest hits from a two-decade span of hip-hop &#150; from the &quot;golden 
        age&quot; of the mid-80s to mid-90s &quot;when it seemed that every new 
        single reinvented the genre&quot; (Rolling Stone), to the chart-topping 
        artists at the turn of the millennium. Simmons, who is widely credited 
        with ushering in a hip-hop cultural revolution with the launch of Def 
        Jam Recordings in 1984, and creating the trailblazing Def Comedy franchise 
        in 1989, will produce through his Los Angeles-based production company 
        Def Pictures, alongside Tony Award-winning Broadway producer Big Block/Scott 
        Prisand (Rock of Ages, Heathers, Gentleman's Guide To Love And Murder). 
        The Scenario will feature an original story written by acclaimed author 
        and hip-hop historian Dan Charnas (The Big Payback), and aims to premiere 
        in New York City in late 2016. </font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Hip 
        hop's explosion was fueled by a generation with an incredible hunger to 
        discover new ways of expression,&quot; said Simmons. &quot;These artists 
        were always breaking the mold with new rhythms and new ideas, while at 
        the same time telling so many important and timeless stories that over 
        the decades have continued to remain just as relevant. This is why the 
        music continues to strike a chord with fans worldwide. It felt like such 
        a natural fit to weave the best of these sounds and stories into an energetic 
        and thrilling musical that would transport audiences through one of the 
        most innovative artistic movements of our time.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Part 
        of what made the Rock of Ages experience so incredible for theatregoers 
        was the joy of hearing the most beloved songs of an era serve as the storyteller,&quot; 
        said Scott Prisand. &quot;Russell is the catalyst of all this extraordinary 
        music that has already touched generations to the core around the world; 
        we're taking those beats everyone knows and loves, and setting them into 
        a fun original story.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Added 
        Jake Stein, who is shepherding the project on behalf of Def Pictures and 
        will also produce with Simmons, &quot;These classic songs, stories and 
        rhythms will find a new audience on the theater stage. We believe this 
        show will be an entirely new entry point for appreciating hip hop as a 
        transformative art that has shaped culture, fashion, music and entertainment 
        of all forms, and we hope it will help open the door for other live theatrical 
        experiences.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Entrepreneur, 
        author, activist and philanthropist Russell Simmons has launched scores

        theater and finance. His lifelong mission has been giving a voice to extraordinary

        having produced or managed artists such as Kurtis Blow, Run DMC, Houdini

        Def Jam Recordings. Under Simmons' leadership as Chairman, Def Jam signed 
        acts including the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Jay Z and Kanye 
        West. Simmons' long-running HBO series &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; helped 
        make household names of comics including Jamie Foxx, Chris Tucker, Martin 
        Lawrence, Bernie Mac, Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart and JB Smoove. &quot;Def 
        Poetry Jam,&quot; also on HBO, won a Peabody Award and a Broadway version 
        netted Simmons a Tony&reg; Award. Simmons' numerous big-screen hits include 
        The Nutty Professor, which grossed more than $273 million.</font></p>

        Against The World is considered one of the most influential rap albums 
        of all-time and serves as an artistic milestone in Tupac Shakur's career. 
        It was his most introspective and emotionally deep release to date, giving 
        a raw and honest insight into one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all-time.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">March 
        14th, 2015 marked the 20th anniversary of Tupac Shakur's critically acclaimed, 
        GRAMMY&reg; nominated, double-platinum release Me Against The World. Originally 
        released in 1995, this landmark album debuted at No. 1 on both the Billboard 
        200 and Billboard's R&amp;B Albums charts and was Shakur's first album 
        to go to No. 1 on both charts where it stayed for four weeks straight.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Me 
        Against The World features the GRAMMY&reg; nominated single &quot;Dear 
        Mama,&quot; a song paying tribute to his mom, Afeni Shakur, that reached 
        No. 1 on the Hot Rap Singles and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales charts 
        concurrently, and &quot;So Many Tears,&quot; which hit No. 6 on the Hot 
        Rap Singles chart and Top 50 on The Billboard Hot 100. Other classics 
        include the single &quot;Temptations,&quot; which hit No. 13 on the Hot 
        Rap Singles chart, &quot;Lord Knows,&quot; &quot;Death Around the Corner&quot; 
        and &quot;Outlaw.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Tupac 
        Shakur leaves a legacy of honesty and passion. With sales of over 75 million 
        albums worldwide, his unapologetic lyrics are as relevant today as they 
        were 20 years ago. Tupac's music has earned attention and respect through 
        a poetic style that allowed his message of hope to come through as he 
        diagnosed issues our society struggles with to this day. Considered by 
        many to be one of the biggest influences on modern hip-hop, Tupac's thought 
        provoking lyrics continue to be a catalyst for change.<br>

        the Rapper and Ludacris joined Internet Essentials and city and school 
        leaders at Alcott College Prep on Tuesday afternoon to kick off the popular 
        Get Schooled, Get Connected Spring Challenge, which is designed to help 
        thousands of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students prepare for college.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Throughout 
        the spring challenge, more than 112,000 CPS students will have access 
        to free educational tools, resources and games &#150; or &quot;quests&quot; 
        &#150; to engage with even when the school day ends. The quests include 
        information about topics ranging from how to succeed in school and plan 
        for your education to how to apply for college and financial aid resources. 
        This content is delivered through an online technology platform on getschooledgetconnected.com, 
        and it features a series of pop culture references and localized information 
        that maintains students' interest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Data 
        from the Get Schooled, Get Connected Fall Challenge shows the content 
        not only holds students' interest, but the platform also engages and educates 
        them about college opportunities,&quot; Alcott College Prep assistant 
        principal Grace Moody said. &quot;The challenge is a great tool for CPS 
        students who want to go to college and for educators who want to help 
        them advance.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Students 
        may become eligible for prizes depending on the number of quests they 
        complete and points they earn. Individual prizes include special celebrity 
        VIP meet-and-greets, $1,000 Get Schooled scholarships, concert and sports 
        tickets, laptops, athletic wear and gaming systems. The schools with the 
        most student points will receive support from Internet Essentials and 
        the CPS-affiliated Children's First Fund to enhance their classrooms and 
        school technology. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        January, Internet Essentials provided $100,000 in support for school foundations 
        and community-based organizations, whose participants earned the most 
        points during the inaugural three-month challenge. Over the past 18 months, 
        Internet Essentials has provided more than $200,000 in support throughout 
        the Chicago region.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Having 
        home Internet access can transform a young person's life, because it opens 
        an entire world to special programs like the Get Schooled, Get Connected 
        Challenge,&quot; said Chance the Rapper, a graduate of Jones College Prep 
        and recipient of Chicago's 2014 Outstanding Youth of the Year award for 
        his community service work. &quot;One student and one family at a time, 
        this program will help close the digital divide by engaging and educating 
        students throughout Chicago.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Chance 
        the Rapper was just one of the celebrities who helped motivate and celebrate 
        student success during the hip fall challenge. Actress and singer-songwriter 
        Christina Milian, singer-songwriter B.o.B, MTV's Sway Calloway, White 
        Sox executive vice president Ken Williams, Chicago Bears safety Ryan Mundy 
        and offensive lineman Jordan Mills, Chicago Fire forward Harry Shipp, 
        former Chicago Bears offensive lineman James &quot;Big Cat&quot; Williams 
        and former Chicago Bulls forward Sidney Green also personally engaged 
        with thousands of students during the fall initiative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Students 
        need Internet access to succeed in school, and families need it to succeed 
        economically,&quot; said Ludacris, who has gone on to become a movie and 
        rap sensation after attending Oak Park-River Forest High School. &quot;I 
        went to high school in this area, so I know first-hand how important it 
        is for students and families to have Internet access at home.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Internet 
        Essentials is a major resource for students participating in the spring 
        challenge. Eligible students and their families may receive affordable 
        Internet service at home for $9.95 per month plus tax, along with an Internet-ready 
        computer for $150 and access to free digital literacy training. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Since 
        launching in August 2011, Internet Essentials has engaged and helped more 
        Chicago families connect to the power of the Internet than any other city 
        in the country. For the fourth year in a row, the Chicago metro area leads 
        the way with more than 50,000 families benefitting, more than 200,000 
        low-income Chicagoans.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That 
        is nearly 25 percent of the eligible population in Chicago that has signed 
        up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Overall 
        in Illinois, 60,000 families or 240,000 individuals benefit from Internet 
        Essentials. Nationally, Internet Essentials has connected more than 450,000 
        low-income families or more than 1.8 million people in just three and 
        a half years. To put that in perspective, 1.8 million equals two-thirds 
        of the population of the entire city of Chicago.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It 
        is vital for CPS students and families to stay connected beyond school 
        hours to ensure they remain life-long learners,&quot; said Dr. Shawn Jackson, 
        CPS Deputy Chief of Teaching and Learning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        conjunction with Internet Essentials and the Chicago City of Learning, 
        CPS also has launched CPS Connects, which provides students free virtual 
        learning opportunities as well as live activities across Chicago at locations 
        like the Museum of Science and Industry, Adler Planetarium and Lincoln 
        Park Zoo. CPS Connects provides students with connected learning environments 
        by linking learning in school, home and community.</font></p>

        testified he crafted in about an hour in mid-2012.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams 
        told jurors that Gaye's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth. 
        But the seven-time Grammy winner said he didn't use any of it to create 
        &quot;Blurred Lines.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Gaye's 
        children &#151; Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III &#151; sued the singers 
        in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        verdict may face years of appeals.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Blurred 
        Lines&quot; has sold more than 7.3 million copies in the U.S. alone, according 
        to Nielsen SoundScan figures. It earned a Grammy Awards nomination and 
        netted Williams and Thicke millions of dollars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        case was a struggle between two of music's biggest names: Williams has 
        sold more than 100 million records worldwide during his career as a singer-producer, 
        and Gaye performed hits such as &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; and &quot;How 
        Sweet It Is (To be Loved by You)&quot; remain popular.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">During 
        closing arguments, Busch accused Thicke and Williams of lying about how 
        the song was created. He told jurors they could award Gaye's children 
        millions of dollars if they determined the copyright to &quot;Got to Give 
        It Up&quot; was infringed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Howard 
        King, lead attorney for Williams and Thicke, told the panel that a verdict 
        in favor of the Gaye family would have a chilling effect on musicians 
        who were trying to recreate a genre or homage to another artist's sound.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">King 
        denied there were any substantial similarities between &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; 
        and the sheet music Gaye submitted to obtain copyright protection.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams 
        has become a household name &#151; known simply as Pharrell &#151; thanks 
        to his hit song &quot;Happy&quot; and his work as a judge on the &quot;The 
        Voice.&quot; He wrote the majority of &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; and recorded 
        it in one night with Thicke. A segment by rapper T.I. was added later.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams, 
        41, also signed a document stating he didn't use any other artists' work 
        in the music and would be responsible if a successful copyright claim 
        was raised.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Thicke 
        testified he wasn't present when the song was written, despite receiving 
        credit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        trial focused on detailed analyses of chords and notes in both &quot;Blurred 
        Lines&quot; and &quot;Got to Give It Up.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Jurors 
        repeatedly heard the upbeat song &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; and saw snippets 
        of its music video, but Gaye's music was represented during the trial 
        in a less polished form. Jurors did not hear &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; 
        as Gaye recorded it, but rather a version created based solely on sheet 
        music submitted to gain copyright protection.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That 
        version lacked many of the elements &#151; including Gaye's voice &#151; 
        that helped make the song a hit in 1977. Busch derisively called the version 
        used in court a &quot;Frankenstein-like monster&quot; that didn't accurately 
        represent Gaye's work.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">An 
        expert for the Gaye family said there were eight distinct elements from 
        &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; that were used in &quot;Blurred Lines,&quot; 
        but an expert for Williams and Thicke denied those similarities existed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Gaye 
        died in April 1984, leaving his children the copyrights to his music.</font></p>

        PHARRELL INSISTS HE DIDN'T COPY MARVIN GAYE.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Pharrell 
        Williams told a jury Wednesday that he was trying to evoke the feel of 
        Marvin Gaye's music but did not copy the late singer's work when he crafted 
        the 2013 hit &quot;Blurred Lines.&quot;</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams 
        said he grew up listening to Gaye's music and was familiar with his song 
        &quot;Got to Give It Up,&quot; but did not use it as a basis for &quot;Blurred 
        Lines,&quot; which was a hit for him and collaborators Robin Thicke and 
        T.I.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;He's 
        one of the ones we look up to,&quot; Williams said. &quot;This is the 
        last place I want to be.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams, 
        Thicke and T.I. are being sued by Gaye's children who claim &quot;Blurred 
        Lines&quot; infringes their father's copyrights for 1977's &quot;Got to 
        Give It Up,&quot; but Williams' testimony is crucial because he wrote 
        the song's music and most of its lyrics. Although Thicke received a songwriting 
        credit on the song, he acknowledged earlier in the trial that he didn't 
        do much work on the song.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">T.I.'s 
        rap track was added later, and Williams said he wasn't involved in its 
        inclusion in &quot;Blurred Lines,&quot; which was nominated for a Grammy 
        Award. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, is expected to be among 
        the case's final witnesses on Thursday.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams 
        spent more than an hour describing his musical process and he how he crafted 
        &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; in mid-2012 in between working on tracks with 
        Miley Cyrus and rapper Earl Sweatshirt. Thicke arrived after the music 
        and lyrics had been written, Williams recalled. He quickly brought the 
        singer up to speed and they began recording what would become 2013's biggest 
        hit song.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We 
        were bopping and dancing,&quot; Williams recalled. &quot;It was a cool 
        night.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">His 
        answers were sometimes too lengthy for U.S. District Judge John A. Kronstadt, 
        who cut off Williams several times mid-sentence and didn't allow him to 
        elaborate on some of his answers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Blurred 
        Lines&quot; has earned more than $16 million in profits and more than 
        $5 million apiece for Thicke and Williams, according to testimony offered 
        earlier in the trial.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams 
        said after the song was released, he saw similarities between &quot;Blurred 
        Lines&quot; and Gaye's work but said that wasn't a conscious part of his 
        creative process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Richard 
        S. Busch, who represents the Gaye family, asked Williams whether he felt 
        &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; captured the feel of the era in which Gaye recorded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Feel,&quot; 
        Williams responded. &quot;Not infringed.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        case opened last week and featured testimony from Thicke, who told jurors 
        that he took a songwriting credit on &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; despite 
        Pharrell doing most of the work.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Thicke 
        brought a bit of showmanship to a trial that has focused on minute details 
        of chords and sheet music. He performed elements of &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; 
        and hits by U2 and The Beatles to show how different songs can include 
        similar-sounding musical elements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Williams 
        did not perform any music during his more than hour of testimony, and 
        complained that audio comparisons of &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; and &quot;Got 
        to Give It Up&quot; had been created in a way that made them sound similar.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Despite 
        the lack of vocals on the tracks, Thicke bobbed his head while his hit 
        was played.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        trial has included detailed analysis of snippets of chords and notes from 
        both songs, all created in the same key. Jurors have heard &quot;Blurred 
        Lines&quot; and lawyers for Gaye's family wanted the panel to hear &quot;Got 
        to Give It Up,&quot; but Kronstadt has limited how the song can be presented 
        in court. Rulings state Gaye's song can only be played as it appears in 
        a sheet music submitted to get the song copyright protection.</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2"><br>

        announced today the appointment of music industry veteran Brian Roberts 
        as the organization&#146;s Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Operating 
        Officer, reporting to ASCAP CEO Elizabeth Matthews. Roberts was most recently 
        Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy &amp; Operations at Warner

        KANYE GIVES BIZARRE LECTURE @ OXFORD UNIVERSITY.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Kanye 
        West visited Oxford University on Monday, and students live blogged some 
        of the crazy things the US rapper came out with. Yeezus spoke at the Oxford 
        University Museum of Natural History at a function hosted by the Oxford 
        Guild Business Society, which dates back to 1897.<br>
        The society announced the news on Facebook on Sunday after &quot;a great 
        deal of hard work and extensive negotiations.&quot; Naturally, when the 
        man himself actually took to the stage, there was much excitement. More 
        than 1,600 people said they were attending on Facebook.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Students 
        kept the public updated about their special guest on a standalone publication 
        called &quot;Versa&quot; and tweeted about the goings on using hash tags 
        such as #YesWeKanye. The Tab, the country's cross-uni student newspaper, 
        also did a live blog on Twitter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Kanye 
        got going at 3 p.m. and talked for about half an hour. Versa noted initial 
        doubts that the whole project could have been a &quot;monumental troll,&quot; 
        but just before the hour mark confirmed that he was in the building.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We 
        all know about Kanye's antics, odd thoughts, and love of Steve Jobs &#151; 
        and his university &quot;lecture&quot; didn't disappoint. It follows a 
        very different setting to his Nando's exploits last month, and his most 
        recent moment of absurdity at the Grammys, of course.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some 
        of the things he said during his speech at Oxford University, documented 
        by Versa in full, have to be among the most memorable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And 
        here are some more from Versa:<br>
        <br>
        Kanye: &quot;Now I understand that I&#146;m just serving, and with my 
        voice and my ability to build relationships, and call Elon Musk or Obama 
        out of the blue, with that I have a responsibility to serve. Why I say 
        the Matrix is like the Bible and what is my definition of the Matrix?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">K: 
        &quot;You're looking for this moment where you sit in your BMW and you 
        look at all of the work that you've done and how big your house is, and 
        somehow you think you're gonna get that level of joy that my daughter 
        had when she was seeing those wolves.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        We spoke to Versa's editor, Ruth Maclean, about the visit. She said students 
        heard about the event only the night before and &quot;everyone went crazy 
        staying up all night to get tickets. Not every lecturer at Oxford is as 
        exciting as Kanye.&quot; <font size="1">Source: Business Insider</font><br>

        Ice-T spoke as part of Bunker Hill Community College's Compelling Conversations 
        speaker series on February 26, delivering a lively talk that drew laughs 
        and applause from an overflow audience. Before his presentation, Ice-T 
        enjoyed a lunch prepared by Culinary Arts students and interacted with 
        students in two Learning Community Seminars, &quot;Connecting to Your 
        Inner Orange Line: Next Stop, Community College&quot; and &quot;Do the 
        Right Thing.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ice-T described losing 
        both of his parents at an early age and finding a substitute family as 
        an affiliate of the Rollin' 60's Crip Gang in Los Angeles, California. 
        He enlisted as a U.S. Army Ranger and served four years, he said, but 
        when a sergeant told him he wouldn't make it in real life, Ice-T decided 
        to &quot;stop being a chess piece on a board.&quot; Eventually he transformed 
        what he called crime rhymes into a rap career as the self-proclaimed original 
        gangster, and paid his dues in a handful of low-budget films before winning 
        better roles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Offering encouragement 
        to the largely student audience, Ice-T said, &quot;You are starting from 
        a better place than I did. You're right where you should be.&quot; He 
        advised students to choose their own path, stay focused and be willing 
        to work hard. After Ice-T's talk, BHCC English major and veteran Robert 
        Harrigan rapped a rhyme he wrote about suicide and PTSD that won sustained 
        applause from Ice-T and the audience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born Tracy Marrow 
        in Newark, New Jersey, Ice-T launched his rap music career in 1984 in 
        the film Breakin' and went on to record a string of groundbreaking rap 
        records. He subsequently formed the thrash metal band Body Count. His 
        acting career includes roles in the films New Jack City, Ricochet, Trespass, 
        Johnny Mnemonic, Surviving the Game, Tank Girl, and on NBC-TV's Law &amp; 
        Order: Special Victims Unit, where he plays Detective Fin Tutuola. At 
        17 years his is the longest running stint for a television cop. He serves 
        as a mentor for at-risk youth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more than a decade, 
        Compelling Conversations has brought high-profile speakers to Bunker Hill 
        Community College to discuss their professional experience and provide 
        inspiration for students&#151;from actor Giancarlo Esposito to boxer Laila

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The

        president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics in the United 
        States, will take on the same role at i.am+, a 60-person start-up based 
        in Los Angeles. Mr. Molyneux will report to Will.i.am, the company&#146;s 
        co-founder and chief executive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        company has released one product, a $399 wristband device called Puls, 
        for which it has done a limited rollout. Unlike most of the smart bracelets 
        on the market, which are primarily fitness trackers, Puls has a built-in 
        cellphone and does not require a conventional handset to make calls and 
        access the Internet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        an interview, Mr. Molyneux said the company envisioned a family of wearable 
        products merging fashion and technology, all based on a common operating 
        system that it developed, AneedA, which uses Google&#146;s Android software. 
        Unlike the smartphone business, the wearables market is young and full 
        of smaller companies like Fitbit that are garnering meaningful sales.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">They 
        dynamics of the business could change soon with the arrival of the Apple 
        Watch. Apple is expected to share further details about the product at 
        an event on March 9. Mr. Molyneux predicted that Apple&#146;s product 
        and marketing would be like the rising tide that lifts others&#146; boats.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;It&#146;s 
        significant, of course,&#148; he said. &#147;The launch of the Apple Watch 
        will bring a whole new consumer focus to the wearables area and tethered 
        devices.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mr. 
        Molyneux, who worked for Sony for 28 years in a variety of roles, said 
        there was no comparison between the agility of his new and old employers. 
        &#147;Their ability too innovate and pivot in microseconds is something 
        bigger companies can&#146;t do,&#148; he said. <font size="1">Source:

        and producer Black Milk will be touring the U.S. this spring and summer

        include collaborations with Bun B, Danny Brown, Black Thought, Robert 
        Glasper, Adrian Younge, Pete Rock, BadBadNotGood, and Blu. He released 
        his fifth and latest solo album, If There's A Hell Below in October 2014

        album of mine is the best, that's for the fans to decide,&quot; says Black 
        Milk, &quot;but at this point I feel like I'm making the best music of

        one of the most celebrated producers and rappers of his generation of 
        hip-hop artists, Black Milk has conditioned fans and critics to expect 
        the unexpected with each release. Few producers have earned the notoriety 
        and respect he has as a musician, and when that is coupled with commanding 
        talent as an emcee, it's no surprise that his solo releases are met with 
        exalted anticipation. His new full-length album, If There's A Hell Below, 
        continues Black's trend of releasing material that maintains his signature

        BIG PIMPIN LAWSUIT TAKES NEW TURN.<br>

        legal disputes in the entertainment industry are older than Osama Ahmed 
        Fahmy's eight-year war over &quot;Big Pimpin'.&quot; Jay Z himself as 
        well as MTV, Paramount Pictures, Warner Music and others are still involved 
        in an eight-year-old case examining allegations that the song's unmistakably 
        catchy hook illicitly derives from &quot;Khosara, Khosara&quot; from the 
        1960 Egyption film Fata Ahlami. As that case proceeds, a new lawsuit was 
        launched yesterday that aims to hold Live Nation responsible for its part.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">According 
        to the complaint, &quot;Big Pimpin'&quot; has been mentioned regularly 
        in Jay Z concert previews and a &quot;substantial percentage of people 
        who purchased tickets to Jay Z's shows hoped he would perform Big Pimpin', 
        expected he would perform Big Pimpin', and would have been disappointed 
        if he had not performed Big Pimpin'. On information and belief, Live Nation 
        has profited substantially from Jay Z's performance of Big Pimpin', including, 
        but not limited to, profits from ticket sales, merchandise, parking, concessions,

        latest legal action attempts to lay direct and contributory copyright 
        liability on the concert promotion giant. &quot;Live Nation knew that 
        Big Pimpin' infringed upon the Khosara, Khosara copyright, but it nevertheless 
        continued to sponsor, promote, and facilitate Jay-Z's performances of 
        the infringing work,&quot; states the lawsuit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        epic litigation over &quot;Big Pimpin',&quot; which originally came out 
        in 2000, has refused to settle and has explored some interesting legal 
        issues.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        the early days of the prior, still-ongoing lawsuit, a California federal 
        judge was forced to examine the &quot;moral rights&quot; of authors under 
        Egyptian law upon Fahmy's allegation that Jay Z had mutilated &quot;Khosara, 
        Khosara&quot; through sampling. More recently, there's been the issue 
        of laches &#151; or an unreasonable delay in pursuing a right or claim 
        &#151; and thanks to a Supreme Court opinion involving Raging Bull, the 
        judge in the case reconsidered an opinion that barred Fahmy from pursuing 
        damages during certain years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Then 
        there's the issue of how &quot;Big Pimpin&quot; producers executed in 
        2001 a settlement with EMI, which once asserted rights to &quot;Khosara, 
        Khosara&quot; based on an agreement with the Egyptian outfit Sout El Phan. 
        The agreement expired in 2006, and Fahmy argues it's void because the 
        real owners of &quot;Khosara, Khosara&quot; never consented to it. Earlier 
        this month, Fahmy brought a summary judgment motion arguing that Jay Z 
        was not conveyed a valid license to make the sample. A hearing is scheduled 
        on the matter in late March.</font></p>

        Records, a new movement and recording label created by Janelle Mon&aacute;e, 
        has teamed with Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment, 
        to announce the launch of a landmark joint venture partnership. Featuring 
        an electrifying roster of artists &#151; Jidenna, Roman GianArthur, Deep 
        Cotton, and St. Beauty &#151; the news of this partnership signals a seismic 
        shift in music and culture that will be felt for years to come.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Wondaland 
        Records is launching with the release of its dynamic first single, &quot;Classic

        will serve as the lead track on the Wondaland Records compilation arriving

        by Janelle Mon&aacute;e featuring Jidenna.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;The 
        collective talent of the Wondaland artists is awe-inspiring,&quot; said 
        LA Reid, Chairman and CEO, Epic Records. &quot;I haven't personally witnessed 
        a collective that sounds and looks this special in quite a while. I've 
        been a longtime supporter and friend of Janelle and it is an honor to 
        now work with her as a visionary businesswoman who brings an all-star 
        group of talented performers to the table.&quot;</font></p>

        voices, styles, and figures coming together with a shared mission for 
        revolutionizing the future of music, arts, and culture that is creatively 
        unmatched.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I'm 
        so thrilled to share Wondaland Records with the world. Each artist under 
        Wondaland Records has unparalleled talent, incredible vision, and brings 
        something unique to the music industry,&quot; said Janelle Mon&aacute;e. 
        &quot;Together, we're creating a new movement and space for the future 
        of music and pop culture. I'm honored to be partnering with Epic Records 
        and my friend LA Reid to present such extraordinary talent.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        son of a Nigerian chief and an American anthropologist, Jidenna is an 
        East Flatbush, Brooklyn-based lyrical wizard, a thought leader with charisma 
        to spare. His worldly origins inform the groundbreaking genre Swank, an 
        elegant and funky take on hip-hop that transforms ordinary parties into 
        sweaty soir&eacute;es.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Musical 
        iconoclasts Nate 'Rocket' Wonder and Chuck Lightning are the mad geniuses 
        behind Deep Cotton. They are thinkers and tinkerers whose approach to 
        sound creates a rollercoaster ride, taking the listener through a world 
        of falsetto-filled funk, rule-breaking ideas baked in rock 'n' roll, and 
        served up in hip-hop, all in the span of a single song. Their sole mission: 
        give you the license to freak out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        curious and brilliant composer, arranger, and producer, Roman GianArthur's 
        music is courageous, feisty, and consistently touches the soul. His live 
        show is a revelation&#151;wild, heroic guitar playing, outstanding vocals, 
        intoxicatingly original movement, and a rare charisma possessed only by 
        the greats.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Featuring 
        Alex Belle and Isis Valentino, the enchanting sound of St. Beauty feels 
        timeless. Thoughtful musicians and songwriters, they weave together melodies 
        that are impossible to forget and evocative lyrics that paint richly textured 
        emotional stories, casting a spell over the listener that cannot be broken.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        inter-disciplinary approach to creativity that the brilliant members of 
        the Wondaland Records roster possess has far-reaching implications for 
        pop culture beyond music&#151; a range of paradigm-shifting art of all 
        kinds is slated for release throughout the remainder of 2015 and beyond.<br>

        her much-talked-about performance at the Super Bowl XLIX earlier this

        a recent phone interview with SiriusXM's &quot;Sway in the Morning&quot;, 
        the raptress said that she'd be working on her new music with rapper/producer 
        Timbaland. </font></font></font></p>

        some work done,&quot; she said. Asked if she'd be making a comeback album, 
        Elliott refused to give more details. &quot;I don't want to say too much 
        because in this day and time, boy, you say something, they will come back 
        two weeks later like, 'Where your album at?' &quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Elliott 
        came out as a surprise guest at Katy Perry's headlining set during the 
        halftime show at last week's Super Bowl. In the interview, the &quot;Work 
        It&quot; hitmaker expressed her gratitude to the pop diva for asking her 
        to be a part of the event. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&quot;I 
        thank Katy because she could have picked any artist, and it was big for 
        her,&quot; she said. &quot;She said that she was a fan of mine.&quot; 
        Elliott first thought Perry would ask her to perform the remix to &quot;Friday 
        Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot;, but the 30-year-old star wanted her to play her 
        own songs. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&quot;She 
        said to me, 'God got you here for a reason.' I'm humbly grateful. I've

        Knight pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to murder, attempted murder and other 
        charges filed after he struck two men with his truck last week.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
        former rap music mogul is accused of intentionally running down two men, 
        including a friend, in Compton on Thursday after an argument on a movie 
        set.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Knight 
        remains in custody and appeared in court wearing orange jail attire.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">However, 
        his attorney James Blatt has said the collision was an accident that occurred 
        as Knight was trying to flee an altercation in which he was assaulted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
        49-year-old Knight could face life in prison if convicted. After pleading 
        not guilty in court today, TMZ is reporting that Suge was rushed to the 
        hospital for suffering a panic attack.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">On 
        Monday, prosecutors charged Knight with killing 55-year-old Terry Carter 
        and attempting to kill 51-year-old Cle &quot;Bone&quot; Sloan. Knight 
        also faces two charges of hit-and-run.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 
        addition, Knight's $2 million bail was revoked after a court commissioner 
        agreed with authorities that he was a potential flight risk and could 
        intimidate witnesses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
        ruling came after homicide detectives told the bail commissioner that 
        Knight could face a lengthy prison sentence because of a violent criminal 
        past, said Los Angeles County sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Knight 
        was out on bail in a separate robbery case when the men were hit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 
        the current case, Knight struck two men with his pickup in a Compton burger 
        stand parking lot. The collision killed his friend Carter, a founder and 
        owner of Heavyweight Records who was viewed as a local father figure and 
        tried to help mentor young men in the community, said Doug Young, a friend 
        and hip-hop music promoter. Also injured in the collision was Sloan, an 
        actor and film consultant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Authorities 
        said Knight visited the set for &quot;Straight Outta Compton,&quot; a 
        film about the rise of the rap group N.W.A., and argued with Sloan, who 
        was working at the location on Thursday. Sheriff's deputies providing 
        security asked Knight to leave.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">A 
        short time afterward, the argument resumed in a parking lot a few miles 
        away where Knight and Sloan exchanged punches through a window of the 
        pickup before the two men were run down, authorities said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Blatt 
        has said Knight was attacked by four people, including Sloan, as he pulled 
        into the parking lot after Carter requested he show up for a meeting. 
        Blatt said Knight hit the gas and fled in fear.</font></p>

        Neighbor Eileen Freeman said she heard six distinct shots just after 8

        self-published his solo album in 2001 and released more than a dozen albums

        influential Bay Area artists, including E-40, Andre Nickatina, Yukmouth, 
        Messy Marv and Keak Da Sneak.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;He

        launched in just the two markets last year, with a focus on high-quality 
        streams &#151; a factor it hopes will lead people to pay $20/month for 
        the service as opposed to the usual $10/month you&#146;ve come to expect 
        from the likes of Rdio or Deezer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        acquisition bid was made under the &#147;Project Panther Bidco Ltd&#148; 
        moniker, according to the press release, which is &#147;indirectly&#148; 
        owned by S. Carter Enterprises (SCE). You&#146;ll note that there&#146;s 
        no mention of Jay-Z in there, but that&#146;s because Jay-Z&#146;s real 
        name is &#133; Shawn Carter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">According 
        to the release, Aspiro&#146;s board of directors has &#147;unanimously 
        recommended&#148; that all Aspiro shareholders accept the offer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        offer tabled by &#147;Panther&#148; values each Aspiro share at SEK 1.05 
        ($0.13), and the total value of the deal at SEK 464 million ($56 million).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Aspiro 
        says it first received a notice of interest from SCE on December 3, and 
        on December 13 Aspiro and SCE entered into an agreement that prevented 
        Aspiro from actively soliciting offers from other potential buyers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While 
        the deal is yet to be signed and sealed, it looks certain to be given 
        the go-ahead, with the acceptance period running between February 19 and 
        March 11. The main stipulation from Panther is that, whatever the outcome 
        of any bartering or negotiations, Jay-Z wants to own at least 90 percent 
        of the company.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So 
        in effect, this is Jay-Z making a big play for the music-streaming market 
        and aligning himself with fellow rapper Dr. Dre, who cofounded the now 
        Apple-owned Beats Electronics, which also offers the Beats Music streaming 
        service in the U.S.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It&#146;s 
        an interesting move for sure, one that gives Jay-Z direct entry into the 
        on-demand U.S. music-streaming market. But it&#146;s also an incredibly 
        competitive space, with the likes of Spotify, Rdio, and Beats also offering 
        their wares. Can Jay-Z help Tidal conquer?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Just 
        as Dr. Dre made a monumental success of his premium Beats headphones brand, 
        a major celebrity such as Jay-Z aligning himself with a premium music-streaming 
        service might just work.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Tidal 
        streams at around CD-quality &#151; 44.1 kHz / 16-bit FLAC and ALAC music 
        files at 1411 kbps. This includes mobile. It&#146;s around four times 
        higher than most of its direct competitors, so it will be interesting 
        to see whether Jay-Z can &#147;sex up&#148; the brand in the right demographics 
        and tempt people to pay around double what Spotify and Beats charge.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        an interview with VentureBeat back in November, Tidal CEO Andy Chen said 
        there are enough people willing to spend a little bit more for better 
        sound. Particularly when you consider millions are willing to dig deep 
        to buy top-notch speakers and headphones. Indeed, what&#146;s the point 
        of having good hardware if the quality of the sound lets you down?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It&#146;s 
        also worth noting that this deal isn&#146;t just about the U.S. market. 
        While Beats is only available in the U.S. at the moment, Tidal is in the 
        U.K. too, and its sister brand, WiMP, has a head start in Scandinavia 
        and elsewhere in Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2015 
        is shaping up to be an interesting year in the music-streaming realm for 
        sure. <font size="1">Source: Venture Beat<br>

        in New Orleans as Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., the 32-year-old rapper said 
        in the lawsuit that his relationship with the label has been deteriorating

        promises regarding monthly accounting statements and the timely payment 
        of profits owed to Lil Wayne.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        lawsuit said the problems worsened since 2012 as Cash Money failed to 
        pay Lil Wayne a 49 percent share of net income derived from the sale of 
        solo recordings by rapper Drake for Lil Wayne's partial ownership of the 
        Young Money label, despite Drake's rise as one of the best-selling recording 
        artists in recent years. Nicki Minaj is also signed to the label.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It

        for the Young Money label even though it is required to obtain approval 
        from Lil Wayne for expenses greater than $300,000. And it said the company 
        is preventing artists recommended by Lil Wayne from being added to the 
        Young Money label and is failing to pay third parties involved with the 
        Young Money label, leading to lawsuits and additional costs.</font></p>

        Mixtape consists of people with whom we have built relationships throughout 
        the years. We have local, regional, national and international artists 
        on Vol. 2. There is a mixture of legendary, seasonal and upcoming artists 
        on this project.&quot; Anaheim Mixtape is sponsored in part by Club Judah

        with Gospel Hip-Hop.&quot;</font></p>

        incorporated as the second city in Los Angeles County on March 18, 1876. 
        The name Anaheim means &quot;home by the river&quot; or just &quot;home.&quot; 
        We want to pay our respects to the founding fathers of our city of Anaheim, 
        CA. Our vision for the mixtape is to give those who are in union with 
        the Gospel Hip-Hop genre the blessing to feel at home in our area of the 
        West Coast. This mixtape is a peace treaty with other artists from around 
        the country, letting them know that they are not alone. </font></p>

        the former lead singer for the legendary Latin Rock Band Malo, which is 
        known for their hit song, Suavecito. We have agreed to visit the University

        of Hip-Hop concerts, workshops, interviews, revivals, feeding the homeless, 
        and building up those who have lost everything. The plan is to give out 
        the Anaheim Mixtape Vol. 2 for free to those who are down and out. It 
        is time to reach out to the people of Hawaii.</font></p>

        Mixtape update: Anaheim Mixtape, Vol. 1 was dedicated to Michael Martinez, 
        Jr. who was killed Saturday, Aug. 30, 2013, and to all the families who 
        have lost loved ones to gang violence. In December of last year, San Bernardino 
        police arrested more than 30 gang members and confiscated dozens of weapons 
        in a month-long operation to crack down on gang violence. As a result, 
        authorities believe they arrested the murderer of Michael Martinez, Jr., 
        a man named Cory Thomas, 20, an alleged gang member. We want to take this 
        time to thank all those who have supported our Vol. 1 Mixtape. Thank you

        times, but a legally binding agreement that puts that into action has 
        remained elusive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        key sticking point is how to pay for it. Another is how much historical

        say.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        Manhattan federal court jury awarded the group most of the $2 million 
        it requested at a June trial, but that was not enough to cover costs that 
        lawyers said were worsened by the actions of the Corona, California-based 
        Monster Energy Co., the musicians' lawyers said in papers filed in Manhattan 
        federal court.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">They 
        said more than two years of litigation punctuated by Monster's failure 
        to engage in good-faith negotiations, an eight-day trial and Monster's 
        effort to overturn the verdict ran up the legal bill.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Monster's 
        tactics significantly increased the costs for Beastie Boys to vindicate 
        their intellectual property rights, such that, absent an award of attorney's 
        fees and costs, plaintiff's success at trial would become a Pyrrhic victory,&quot; 
        they wrote in a filing Saturday.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Monster 
        had admitted wrongly using the group's songs in a video that was online 
        for five weeks. But the beverage maker said at trial it should owe no 
        more than $125,000. The company's lawyers did not immediately respond 
        to messages seeking comment Monday.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Beastie Boys, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, have 
        turned out four No. 1 albums and sold more than 40 million records as 
        they helped bring hip-hop to the mainstream over the last three decades. 
        In 1986, they topped the charts with their debut, &quot;Licensed to Ill,&quot; 
        which include the anthem &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot;</font></p>

        Boys' band members Adam &quot;Ad-Rock&quot; Horovitz and Michael &quot;Mike 
        D&quot; Diamond both testified at trial, with Horovitz waiting throughout 
        several hours of jury deliberations to be in court for the outcome. Another 
        member of the band, the gravelly-voiced rapper Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch, 
        died of cancer in May 2012 at age 47.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Horovitz

        endorse commercial products.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        a December ruling upholding the verdict and award, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer 
        said that five Beastie Boys songs used by Monster in a video made it easy 
        to conclude that the Beastie Boys were endorsing Monster products. He 
        also said the jury's finding that Monster acted in bad faith would be 
        relevant to an award of attorney's fees.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        group's lawyers said Monster had offered as much as $250,000 to settle 
        before trial but had demanded the Beastie Boys drop their demands to below 
        $1 million. The lawyers said the group had agreed to reduce its demands 
        to $1.65 million.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">They 
        said the Beastie Boys even offered to negotiate a deal post-trial to curb 
        additional litigation costs, but Monster did not respond to the offer. 
        As a result, they added, they should be awarded attorney's fees of $2.38 
        million, including $895,926 spent prior to trial, $1.28 million during 
        trial and the $200,438 post-trial cost through December</font>.</p>

        Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has accused President Barack Obama and his 
        wife Michelle of parenting by double-standard, in an interview published 
        Tuesday, saying they shelter their daughters from some things but allow 
        them to listen to the music of Beyonc&eacute;.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While 
        promoting his new book, Huckabee told People magazine, &quot;I don't understand 
        how on one hand they can be such doting parents and so careful about the 
        intake of everything &#151; how much broccoli they eat and where they 
        go to school ... and yet they don't see anything that might not be suitable&quot; 
        in the lyrics and a Beyonc&eacute; choreography &quot;best left for the 
        privacy of her bedroom.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Huckabee 
        described the Grammy Award-winning Beyonc&eacute; in his book as &quot;mental 
        poison.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Beyonc&eacute; 
        could not be a better role model for my girls,&quot; Obama said.</font></p>

        birthday party at the White House.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Huckabee's 
        latest book, titled &quot;God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,&quot; is full of 
        criticism of Washington, New York and Hollywood and serves as a direct 
        appeal to cultural conservatives, long part of his political base. Huckabee's 
        rhetoric is likely to win him more fans among conservative activists who 
        have tremendous sway in picking the GOP's presidential nominees in early 
        nominating states such as Iowa and South Carolina.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Huckabee 
        recently stepped down from his role as host of a weekend program on Fox 
        News Channel. He ran for president in 2008, considered running in 2012, 
        and has said he's weighing whether to seek the GOP nomination in 2016.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
        he enters the contest, he has a strong network of pastors in the early 
        states who can help mobilize their faithful. That network helped him win 
        the lead-off Iowa caucuses in 2008, as well as earn victories in Alabama, 
        Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Virginia.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Huckabee 
        is no stranger to such pointed statements. At a Republican National Committee 
        meeting last year in Washington, he suggested Democrats wanted women to 
        believe they were helpless without government-financed birth control.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;If 
        the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe 
        that they are helpless without 'Uncle Sugar' coming in and providing for 
        them a prescription each month for birth control, because they cannot 
        control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of 
        the government, then so be it,&quot; Huckabee said. &quot;Let us take 
        that discussion all across America.&quot;</font></p>

        the American Revolutionary War became the first settlement of Black Canadians.

        DJ Premier finishes all the last minute tasks, taking down the soundproofing, 
        in-wall speakers and moving the last bit of his equipment, furniture and 
        hundreds of vinyl records, it&#146;s certainly a hectic time in his life---but 
        it does not mean there isn&#146;t time to reflect on one of the cornerstones 
        of his legacy.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On 
        January 7th, 2015, after nearly twenty-five years, the iconic D&amp;D 
        Studios on the fourth floor of 320 West 37th Street shut its doors. Premier 
        first set up shop at D&amp;D in 1991 to record Gang Starr&#146;s third 
        album, Daily Operation, and ever since it has been both a home and a conduit 
        for artists of all genre&#146;s to attach their lyrics to Preemo&#146;s 
        complex rhythm of the streets. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
        have been innumerable sessions with hundreds of established and emerging 
        artists, a veritable slew of classic recordings and even more stories 
        created at D&amp;D Studios, as Premier set up camp to put his stamp on 
        timeless music from Gang Starr, Rakim, KRS-One, Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, 
        Nas, Christina Aguilera, D&#146;Angelo, Janet Jackson, Mos Def, Common,

        to still unheard and recent recordings with Miguel, Wale, Scarface, De 
        La Soul, Busta Rhymes and Joey Bada$$; all of which were birthed at the 
        legendary Studio.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Twelve 
        years after Premier first set foot in D&amp;D, he bought the studio from 
        its founders, Douglas Grama and David Lotwin, in 2003 and renamed it &#145;HeadQcourterz&#146; 
        after his late friend Kenneth &#147;HeadQcourterz&#148; Walker. While 
        Premier knows the end of D&amp;D closes the book on a major chapter of 
        Hip-Hop history, he also realizes it&#146;s the start of a new phase of 
        his career. &quot;The building was sold in order to change it from commercial 
        business to residential and our leases would not be renewed, so basically 
        that means Everybody Out! It is tough to accept after so many years making 
        that much history there, but life is good and I will continue to make 
        hot music. Passion never leaves your soul and I have a lot of it so I'm 
        ready to continue on.&quot; says Premier.</font></p>

        UNIVERSAL MUSIC FILES COPYRIGHT LAWSUIT OVER MIXTAPES SENT TO PRISONERS.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On 
        Tuesday, Universal Music filed a lawsuit against a group of companies 
        including the Centric Group and Keefe Group alleged to be selling &quot;care 
        packages&quot; that family members and friends can send to inmates who 
        are incarcerated in correctional facilities.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Among 
        the items being sent to prisoners, according to a complaint filed in California 
        federal court, are mixtapes featuring performances by artists like James 
        Brown, Eminem, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Defendants 
        boast on their website that their business 'was developed to eliminate 
        contraband,' yet the infringing copies of Plaintiffs&#146; sound recordings 
        and musical compositions, in which Defendants unlawfully transact and 
        from which they unjustly profit, are contraband personified,&quot; states 
        the lawsuit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        few months ago, Universal put DJ music up for legal examination, and now 
        the company is doing the same for mixtapes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
        the complaint explains, &quot;Mixtapes are a form of recorded music in 
        which DJs combine (or 'mix') tracks, often recorded by different artists, 
        onto a single CD, sometimes creating overlaps and fades between songs, 
        and/or reflecting a common theme or mood. Such so-called 'mixtapes,' unless 
        authorized by the copyright owner or owner of corresponding state law 
        rights, are nothing more than collections of infringing, piratical compilations 
        of copyrighted or otherwise legally protected sound recordings and copyrighted 
        musical composition.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Universal 
        says the &quot;mixtape&quot; is &quot;frequently a cover for piracy,&quot; 
        but acknowledges there are authorized distributors out there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        defendants are alleged not to be in that authorized category, that they 
        are infringing the copyrights of Universal's records and publishing divisions 
        as a &quot;door opener to solicit customers.&quot; Indeed, Universal says 
        that the defendants sometimes sell the music at a financial loss, using 
        items like a hip-hop mixtape as a &quot;loss leader to boost sales of 
        their other goods and services.&quot; Presumably, Universal doesn't believe 
        the mixtapes fall as a fair use.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For 
        allegedly reproducing, distributing and preparing derivative works based 
        on their compositions, Universal is demanding maximum statutory damages 
        in the amount of $150,000 to each copyrighted work infringed. The plaintiff 
        also is asserting state unfair competition claims and seeking the imposition 
        of a constructive trust, restitution of unlawful proceeds, punitive damages 
        and more. The lawsuit is being handled by Jeffrey Goldman at Jeffer Mangels 
        Butler &amp; Mitchell.<font size="1">Source: Hollywood reporter</font></font></p>

        SUES BEATS AND DR. DRE &amp; JIMMY IOVINE.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Monster, 
        which co-designed the original Beats By Dr. Dre headphones, is filing 
        suit against Beats Electronics, the firm acquired by Apple in May and 
        co-founded by musician Dr. Dre and producer Jimmy Iovine.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        audio tech company and its CEO, Noel Lee, say in the suit that he and 
        Monster invented the technology behind the Beats By Dr. Dre headphones. 
        The suit claims that Iovine and Dre (Andre Young) committed fraud in pirating 
        the headphones away from Lee and Monster.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        suit, filed in San Mateo (Calif.) County Superior Court, charges that 
        the Beats co-founders concealed the role of Monster and Lee in designing 
        and engineering the headphone line, as well as educating them about engineering, 
        manufacturing, distributing and selling the headphones that Monster and 
        Lee invented.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
        severing ties with Monster, Beats was purchased by Apple for $3 billion. 
        But as the Beats co-founders made millions, Monster lost millions from 
        its investment in the rise of Beats, the suit charges. Had Lee retained 
        his original 5% interest in Beats, his total stake in the Beats-Apple 
        deal would have been worth over $100 million, the suit alleges.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
        contacted, Apple said that it did not have comment on the suit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Founded 
        in Nevada in 1979 as Monster Cable, Monster assisted in the design of 
        the popular Beats By Dr. Dre headphones. In a previous interview, Lee, 
        who at one time had been a laser-fusion design engineer at Lawrence Livermore 
        Laboratory, said that Monster made 150 samples before Dre and Iovine saw 
        any prototypes. &quot;They went through 20 before it felt right,&quot; 
        Lee said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
        hitting the market in 2008, the headphones virtually created a high-end 
        styles category of $300-plus headphones. High-end headphones became a 
        $1 billion market in wholesale revenue in 2013, and Iovine has said Beats 
        itself had revenue surpassing $1 billion last year.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Even 
        before Beats and Monster's five-year manufacturing and distribution deal 
        ended, HTC invested $300 million in Beats in 2011.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Iovine 
        and Dre bought back the entirety of Beats in 2013, a year before Apple 
        acquired the company for $3 billion. Monster lists HTC and Beats board 
        member Paul Wachter among the defendants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Those 
        transactions were a &quot;sham&quot; that Beats used to exercise its &quot;change 
        of control rights&quot; to fraudulently get the headphones away from Monster, 
        said Joseph Cotchett, an attorney with the California-based law firm of 
        Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy, which is representing Monster. &quot;Had 
        the partnership expired on its own terms, there would have been no transfer 
        of Monster's years of work on Beats By Dr. Dre.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
        conspiring to get rid of Monster, Beats also damaged Monster's reputation 
        for developing products, the suit says.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Monster 
        and Lee are asking for punitive damages.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        an exclusive story published last year by Gizmodo, Monster founder Noel 
        Lee and son Kevin Lee shed light on how they were outmaneuvered by the 
        might of Dre, Iovine and Interscope and suggested that they weren't properly 
        compensated for the development of the original headphones. <font size="1">Source:

        &quot;I've been a fan of Mello Music Group since 2009 when I first heard 
        Diamond District's &quot;In The Ruff&quot; and then yU's &quot;Before 
        Taxes&quot;. I was drawn to the music and what appeared to be a dedication 
        to quality from an independent record label that was just getting going. 
        I've looked up to Apollo Brown, Oddisee, Quelle Chris and most of Mello's 
        roster. After releasing Ugly Heroes, I was approached by the label head 
        and Mello Music himself, Mike Tolle, and offered a deal to put out my 
        own solo material with the label. Starting first as a fan, then as part 
        of an incredible Apollo Brown project and now being able to say that I'm 
        officially part of the Mello Music Group roster is amazing. You grow up 
        wanting to find a record label. Wanting to have your music exposed to 
        a loyal, supportive and incredible fanbase. It takes years and years of 
        hard work, patience and a little bit of delusion to think it can ever 
        happen. I'm happy for the opportunity that I've been given from Mello 
        Music Group and excited to start releasing new music with them.&quot;</font></p>

        LEGENDARY SUPER GROUP JODECI RETURNS AFTER 18-YR HIATUS.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One 
        of the most impactful artists of the 1990's has returned after an 18-year 
        hiatus. The super group responsible for unforgettable records such as 
        &quot;Come and Talk to Me,&quot; &quot;Forever My Lady,&quot; and &quot;Feenin&quot; 
        gave fans a sneak peek at their newest record &quot;Nobody Wins&quot; 
        with a performance at the Soul Train Awards last month on Sunday, Nov. 
        30, 2014. Jodeci performed a snippet of the record as part of a medley 
        performance of the group's most popular hit songs.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        fact, Jodeci has continued to record records over the past 18 years. However, 
        the group didn't feel a cohesive creative direction until now. &quot;We've 
        recorded hundreds of songs, even if it's bits and pieces and fragments 
        of songs that we could probably live off of for the rest of our lives,&quot; 
        Mr. Dalvin explained to RollingStone Magazine. &quot;But when creating 
        this album, we chose a body of work that really represents us as a group 
        and represents what people are expecting to hear from Jodeci as a group. 
        People will be pleasantly surprised.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Jodeci 
        feels that now is the time to return with new music. But the group feels 
        that their return comes with a responsibility. As an important group that 
        has always had a voice in culture, Jodeci wants to return with great music 
        that also serves to entertain and inspire. &quot;Nobody Wins&quot; is 
        a record that discourages domestic violence and violence in general and 
        is a message personal to each member of Jodeci.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We 
        aren't immune to issues that are important in our community. Domestic 
        violence has always been an issue in relationships, but lately it's been 
        brought to the front of our community consciousness,&quot; K-Ci explains.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Jodeci 
        is scheduling the release of their new album in the first quarter of 2015,

        finds NE-YO collaborating with some of the most talented names in music 
        today. Juicy J is featured on the new single, &#147;She Knows,&#148; which 
        was produced by powerhouse pop guru Dr. Luke (Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus). 
        Billboard hailed the track as &#147;spare and hard-hitting&#148; while 
        Complex praised its &#147;traditional R&amp;B style.&#148; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;This 
        track is dedicated to the kind of strong, confident woman who demands 
        attention when she walks in the room. All you can think of is, &#145;yeah 
        she knows.&#146; She knows she is beautiful. She knows all eyes are on 
        her. She knows how to command the room,&#148; explains NE-YO. &#147;Dr. 
        Luke&#146;s production is incredible and J brings his club swag to the 
        track. No matter what the song is about, he can always take the subject 
        matter home.&#148; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Other 
        featured artists include Candice, David Guetta, Jeezy, Charisse Mills, 
        Schoolboy Q and T.I. &#147;Time of Our Lives,&#148; NE-YO&#146;s new collaboration 
        with Pitbull, appears on both Non-Fiction and Pitbull&#146;s new album.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        pre-order for Non-Fiction launches today. Fans who pre-order Non-Fiction 
        on iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon will instantly receive &#147;She Knows&#148; 
        feat. Juicy J, &#147;Money Can&#146;t Buy&#148; feat. Jeezy and &#147;Religious.&#148; 
        Non-Fiction will be available in standard and deluxe configurations. The 
        iTunes and Target editions of the deluxe album will each contain two additional 
        tracks exclusive to those retailers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
        its title suggests, every song on Non-Fiction is derived from a true story. 
        Some are NE-YO&#146;s own personal tales while others were submitted by 
        fans on social-media platforms like Twitter and Instagram. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;I 
        didn&#146;t just want to tell my story. I like letting people try to guess 
        which is which!&#148; explains NE-YO. &#147;I&#146;m a storyteller: with 
        this album, I wanted to put a magnifying glass on that. I wanted Non-Fiction 
        to feel cinematic: each track gives listeners something entertaining, 
        yet if they take their time with it, they&#146;ll discover different dimensions 
        and subplots.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">NE-YO 
        was joined in the studio by production mainstays from throughout his career 
        such as Shae Taylor and Stargate plus new associates Key Wayne and Glass 
        John and members of his own Compound Music production team, including 
        Corporal. DJ Camper (JAY Z, Kanye West, John Legend) also worked on many 
        tracks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        new songs are the kind of ultra-relevant narratives blended with powerful 
        hooks that NE-YO became renowned for &#150; both on his own hits like 
        &#147;So Sick,&#148; &#147;Closer&#148; and &#147;Miss Independent&#148; 
        and tracks he&#146;s helped craft for Rihanna, Beyonc&eacute;, Celine 
        Dion, Carrie Underwood, Whitney Houston, Pitbull, Ciara and many others. 
        Non-Fiction follows his late 2012 release, R.E.D. (Realizing Every Dream), 
        which received stellar reviews. USA Today noted, &quot;There isn't a more 
        natural singer/songwriter in contemporary R&amp;B than NE-YO&quot; and 
        The Washington Post hailed him as an &#147;extremely gifted and versatile 
        songwriter.&quot; NE-YO's first three studio albums debuted at No. 1 on 
        the SoundScan chart and were all certified RIAA Platinum. He is a three-time 
        GRAMMY&reg; winner and a two-time winner at the BET, MOBO and Soul Train 
        Music awards.<br>

        L. Campbell, president and CEO, National Coalition on Black Civic Participation 
        (NCBCP) and convener, Black Women's Roundtable, released the following 
        statement regarding the Ferguson grand jury's decision not to indict officer 
        Darren Wilson in the unjust killing of Michael Brown:</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        decision by the grand jury in Ferguson, MO not to indict officer Darren 
        Wilson in the shooting and killing of unarmed Michael Brown is a travesty 
        of justice. We believe the St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch's 
        gross mishandling of this case is inexcusable. <br>
        <br>
        The prosecutor appeared to serve as a defense attorney instead of prosecuting 
        attorney seeking justice for an unarmed 18-year-old teenager. Further, 
        the prosecutor's reckless decision to release the grand jury decision 
        at 9 pm is a critical example of his mishandling of this case.<br>
        <br>
        We urge the U. S. Justice Department to continue its full federal investigation 
        in the wrongful death of Michael Brown, as well as its investigation of 
        excessive police misconduct in the Ferguson Police Department and hope 
        they bring civil rights charges against Officer Wilson<br>
        <br>
        The National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, Black Women's Roundtable 
        and Black Youth Vote joins the civil rights and social justice community 
        in a call for an end to racial profiling of our young Black men and women 
        who are losing their lives across the country at alarming rates at the 
        hands of police officers who are sworn to protect and serve.<br>
        <br>
        Further, we continue to pray that justice will prevail for the Brown family 
        and stand with them in solidarity in their call for peaceful protest and 
        justice for their son Michael.<br>

        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Today 
        Privateer Holdings announced the creation of Marley Natural, the world&#146;s 
        first global cannabis brand. Privateer Holdings is the world&#146;s first 
        private equity firm investing exclusively in the legal cannabis industry. 
        Marley Natural will offer premium cannabis products that honor the life 
        and legacy of Bob Marley as well as his belief in the benefits of cannabis.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;We 
        are joining with Privateer Holdings because they understand and respect 
        our father&#146;s legacy,&#148; said Rohan Marley, Bob&#146;s son.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Starting 
        in late 2015 in certain jurisdictions where regulations permit, Marley 
        Natural will begin offering heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains inspired 
        by those Bob Marley enjoyed. In addition to cannabis, Marley Natural will 
        offer cannabis- and hemp-infused topicals, including sun repair creams 
        and lotions containing Jamaican botanicals such as aloe and coconut, as 
        well as accessories, including limited edition products based on those 
        that Bob preferred. As a brand with a strong social conscience, Marley 
        Natural&#146;s business model and philanthropic initiatives will be built 
        to ensure that families and communities who have been harmed by prohibition 
        have the opportunity to benefit from the new, legal cannabis economy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Bob 
        Marley, a Jamaican-born musician, became a global superstar and advocated 
        for peace, unity, social justice and personal freedom through his music. 
        His greatest hits compilation, Legend, is the world&#146;s best-selling 
        reggae album, with more than 27 million copies sold worldwide. Marley 
        was also a well-known advocate for &#147;the herb,&#148; as he called 
        cannabis, which he said brought him inner peace and furthered his creativity. 
        &#147;When you smoke the herb it reveals you to yourself,&#148; Marley 
        said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Privateer 
        Holdings and the Marley family began discussing the possibility of working 
        together in early 2013 and quickly realized their common values &#150; 
        social change, environmental sustainability and building a professional, 
        responsible and legal cannabis industry. Privateer Holdings is committed 
        to ending the social harms caused by prohibition, just as the Marley family 
        carries on Bob&#146;s vision of social justice through their charitable 
        and business ventures. The Marley family&#146;s strong commitment to sustainability 
        will be carried forward by Marley Natural&#146;s use of organic growing 
        mediums and fertilizers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;My 
        dad would be so happy to see people understanding the healing power of 
        the herb,&#148; said Cedella Marley, Bob&#146;s daughter. &#147;He viewed 
        the herb as something spiritual that could awaken our well-being, deepen 
        our reflection, connect us to nature and liberate our creativity. Marley 
        Natural is an authentic way to honor his legacy by adding his voice to 
        the conversation about cannabis and helping end the social harms caused 
        by prohibition.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;Marley 
        Natural is a partnership between two cannabis pioneers,&#148; said Brendan 
        Kennedy, CEO of Privateer Holdings. &#147;The Marley family has been an

        most celebrated rappers of his generation. The Baton Rouge native first 
        lit up the hip hop underground at just 17 and soon teamed with the renowned

        &quot;SUPERBAD: THE RETURN OF BOOSIE BADAZZ.&quot; His fifth and most 
        recent solo album, 2010's &quot;INCARCERATED,&quot; was recorded and released 
        while serving a 96-month prison sentence at Angola Louisiana State Penitentiary. 
        The album earned widespread acclaim, with SPIN hailing it as &quot;an 
        enormously heartfelt album that makes his legal plight even more of a

        D'Angelo:<br>
        Michael D'Angelo Archer was born in Richmond, VA to the son of a Pentecostal 
        minister. He began teaching himself piano as a very young child, and at 
        age 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater 
        three weeks in a row. In 1991, he signed a publishing deal with EMI.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">D'Angelo's 
        first major success came in 1994 as a writer/producer, helming the single 
        &quot;U Will Know&quot; on the Jason Lyric soundtrack; That helped lead 
        to the success of his debut solo album, 1995's Brown Sugar, which went 
        on to sell over 2 million copies. With the title track &quot;Lady&quot; 
        the album continued to soar on the charts. Defining D'Angelo as one of 
        the founding fathers and leading lights of the neo-soul movement of the 
        mid-to-late '90s; along with artists like Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill and 
        Maxwell.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        early 2000, D'Angelo released his sophomore album, Voodoo which debuted 
        at number one, an indication of just how large and devoted his fan base 
        was. The lead single &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; was a smash 
        on the R&amp;B charts and won a Grammy for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal; likewise, 
        Voodoo won for Best R&amp;B album.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
        nearly a decade, D'Angelo is back and is proud to announce The Second

        singer Keyshia Cole attacked Birdman's personal assistant in a jealous

        $1 million lawsuit.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        her Tuesday lawsuit in Superior Court, Sabrina Mercadel says she has been 
        &quot;platonic friends&quot; since childhood with Birdman, whose real 
        name is Bryan Williams, and has been his personal assistant for several 
        years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mercadel 
        claims she was the victim of Cole's unprovoked attack when she visited 
        the rapper at his Westwood home on Sept. 19 to listen to his new album 
        &quot;Rich Gang,&quot; and offer feedback. Mercadel says Cole confronted 
        her as she walked out of the bathroom and was getting ready to leave, 
        screaming: &quot;'Who the fuck are you! What are you doin' with my man!?'&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Though 
        rumors were swirling about a romantic relationship between Birdman and 
        Cole, Mercadel maintains that she could care less who her old friend was 
        dating. &quot;Given the fact that Mercadel's relationship with Williams 
        was strictly platonic, it was of no consequence to her who Williams was 
        dating,&quot; the 9-page lawsuit states.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
        suggesting that Mercadel was a prostitute by telling her in a &quot;belligerent 
        and condescending manner, 'You can get your money later,'&quot; Cole attacked 
        Mercadel, following her all the way out of the house to the elevators, 
        according to the lawsuit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mercadel 
        claims that by the time she made it to the lobby, Cole had hit her on 
        the butt and in the face, pulled her hair, clawed her &quot;nails against 
        Mercadel's face and inside her mouth,&quot; and threw several &quot;hard 
        objects&quot; at her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">According 
        to the complaint, Cole was arrested for the assault while Mercadel went 
        to hospital to treat her injuries. Mercadel also sued Active Property 
        Management, and Carlyle Residences Home Owners Association for letting 
        Cole into Birdman's home.</font></p>

        A multi-platinum certified and GRAMMY&reg; Award-nominated singer, actor, 
        author, and producer, Omarion is a 21st century superstar of the first 
        order. &quot;O,&quot; his 2005 solo debut, was a chart-topping phenomenon, 
        entering the Billboard 200 at #1 on its way to RIAA platinum certification. 
        The album's 2006 follow-up, &quot;21,&quot; also arrived atop the SoundScan/Billboard 
        200, fueled in part by the gold certified smash single, &quot;Ice Box.&quot; 
        In 2012, Omarion joined forces with Maybach Music Group CEO Rick Ross 
        for the blockbuster single, &quot;Let's Talk,&quot; featured on MMG's 
        hugely successful &quot;SELF MADE VOL. 2&quot; compilation. The &quot;CARE 
        PACKAGE&quot; and &quot;CARE PACKAGE 2&quot; EPs soon followed, as did

        the two-day music festival promoted by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti 
        and held outside City Hall.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Garcetti 
        aides expect the city's tab for the commercial event, held over Labor 
        Day weekend, will reach nearly $670,000. The company that staged the event, 
        Live Nation, was required to provide $500,000 to pay for police patrols, 
        street closures, trash removal and other city services.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        Garcetti played a major role in bringing the festival to L.A. for the 
        first time. Held in downtown's Grand Park, it drew tens of thousands of 
        people and was restricted to those who bought tickets or received complimentary 
        passes. On Monday, the mayor argued the event provided a benefit to the 
        city that exceeded any unreimbursed expenses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We 
        will absolutely net more as a city than we would&quot; if it hadn't happened, 
        he said. &quot;I'm confident of that.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One 
        neighborhood activist said Garcetti and other city officials should have 
        driven a harder bargain with Live Nation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I 
        just don't think the city should pay a penny,&quot; said James O'Sullivan, 
        president of the Miracle Mile Residential Assn. &quot;How many sidewalks 
        can that pay for? How many pipes can it fix? That crucial infrastructure 
        is crumbling, or deteriorating, under our feet.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Initially, 
        single-day tickets for the festival sold for just under $100, with weekend 
        passes costing $185. Prices were discounted in the final days before the 
        event.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        comprehensive analysis of the festival's costs and economic benefits will 
        be provided later this year, said City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana, 
        the city's top budget official.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Garcetti 
        has argued that the festival, which featured such acts as Kanye West, 
        Iggy Azalea and Imagine Dragons, showed L.A. is capable of hosting a huge 
        outdoor music event. Carol Schatz, who heads the downtown-based Central 
        City Assn., said businesses there viewed the festival &#151; and the customers 
        it generated for nearby hotels and restaurants &#151; as &quot;a big plus 
        for downtown.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It's 
        not just a dollar-for-dollar comparison. It's about the perception that 
        it generates &#133; that L.A. is really the place to do this and the place 
        to do this in L.A. is downtown,&quot; Schatz said. That kind of publicity, 
        she added, &quot;is worth millions.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Garcetti 
        said Philadelphia, which has hosted three Made in America festivals, offers 
        an example of the gains cities can realize from such events. A 2012 report 
        released by Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter estimated the two-day festival 
        generated at least $10 million for the city's economy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        Los Angeles, the city's Board of Police Commissioners received a report 
        last week showing Made in America required more than $475,000 in police 
        overtime pay. Services provided by the Department of Transportation, which 
        handled street closures and other services, totaled more than $122,000, 
        Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb said. And the city Fire Department provided 
        more than $35,000 in services, Robb said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Scores 
        of free tickets to the event were distributed by Garcetti aides to city 
        officials, commissioners and staffers, including 12 of the 15 City Council 
        members.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Los 
        Angeles County negotiated a separate agreement that required Live Nation 
        to provide $600,000 for use of Grand Park plus reimbursement for any damage 
        to the park and its surroundings. County officials are seeking $83,000

        In less than eight years since it was first released, the brand became 
        a must-have item at every top nightclub in the world and scored better 
        among wine critics than some of the world&#146;s most famous luxury Champagne 
        marques. To establish an iconic, credible high-end Champagne in such a

        INKS DEAL WITH WARNER MUSIC.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">SoundCloud&#146;s 
        175 million users dwarf Pandora&#146;s 76 million and Spotify&#146;s 40 
        million. But unlike those digital music rivals, SoundCloud had done practically 
        nothing to turn those legions of users into a real business. Now that&#146;s 
        starting to change with its first-ever major label deal, announced on 
        Tuesday, with Warner Music Group.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        agreement doesn&#146;t follow the pattern of previous licensing pacts 
        between a label and a streaming service. Warner will get to place ads 
        on some of its songs and then share the revenue with SoundCloud. About 
        40 bands and smaller labels are already doing this through a program SoundCloud 
        launched in August, with brands like Sonos, Jaguar, and Red Bull advertising 
        on the site.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Warner 
        is likely to leave many songs up on SoundCloud without expecting anything 
        in return. SoundCloud already has lots of music from major and independent 
        labels, and entertainment lawyers haven&#146;t been showing up at its 
        headquarters with pitchforks even though no one is making money from the 
        site. Digital music is valuable for the music industry even if it doesn&#146;t 
        directly lead to revenue. Getting compensated in hype and exposure instead 
        of cash has been controversial inside the industry, but record executives 
        have tended to accept this logic when it comes to SoundCloud. Many users 
        of the service are looking for obscure or unreleased music rather than 
        hit songs or a single place to find a comprehensive catalog.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">SoundCloud 
        Chief Executive Alex Ljung insists any future deals will maintain the 
        flexibility to make money from some songs while leaving many others without 
        ads. &#147;They can start to monetize the things that are there, and they 
        can start letting their artist put more things up,&#148; he says. &#147;It&#146;s 
        not a deal where we say you have to put up your whole catalog.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">SoundCloud 
        still claims it isn&#146;t aiming to create a comprehensive collection 
        of the world&#146;s music and may never strike deals with all the major 
        labels. Ljung declined to discuss the state of negotiations with Universal 
        Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment, which had stalled last month, 
        according to the Financial Times.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Warner 
        is under more pressure than those labels to find innovative ways to make 
        money from digital music because it is smaller. It has been talking to 
        SoundCloud for some time, but a key reason for the breakthrough was SoundCloud&#146;s 
        commitment to develop a paid subscription service early next year. This 
        service could provide ad-free music, songs that aren&#146;t available 
        to free customers, and the ability to store some music on mobile devices 
        for offline listening. Record labels like paid subscription services because 
        they make more from royalties when customers actually pay for the music 
        they&#146;re listening to. <font size="1"><br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Recognized 
        as one of the first hip hop bands, Digital Underground included Chopmaster 
        J, Shock G, Money B, DJ Fuze and the then 18-year-old Tupac Amaru Shakur. 
        The group's meteoric rise to fame in the early '90's was accentuated with 
        chart topping hits like &quot;Doowutchyalike,&quot; &quot;Freaks of the 
        Industry,&quot; &quot;Same Song&quot; and &quot;Kiss You Back.&quot; The 
        band made waves with their colorful and costumed attire, animated stage 
        antics and innovative dance styling and moves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Digital 
        Underground is best remembered for turning hip hop on its proverbial head 
        and invading the realm of pop with their 1990 pivotal Grammy nominated 
        release &quot;The Humpty Dance.&quot; &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; climbed 
        all the way to #11 on the pop charts, #7 on the R&amp;B charts, and #1 
        on the Billboard Rap Singles chart. In 2008, &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; 
        was ranked #30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop and #65 on VH1's 
        100 Greatest Songs of the 90's in 2007. The song was selected in the musical 
        reference book, 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die: And 10,001 You 
        Must Download and nominated for Best Rap Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music 
        Awards. &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; is one of the most sampled songs 
        recorded by a hip hop/rap artist. Shock G and Money B performed as &quot;Digital 
        Underground&quot; at the BET Hip Hop Awards in 2010.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
        group's contribution to history has tentacles that reach even further 
        though. From their 12 inch drop, &quot;Doowutchyalike&quot; to their debut 
        album &quot;Sex Packets,&quot; D.U.'s music unfastened a door in hip hop 
        that was previously non-existent, mixing mad merriment, mayhem and sex 
        with rhyme, rhythm and rap. Factor in the detail that rap music's biggest 
        legend, Tupuc Shakur, started his music career with the group as their 
        roadie, dancer and emcee and the D.U. legacy is all but cemented in the 
        annals of pop music history.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
        crux of the anniversary celebration, the feature length documentary film, 
        &quot;D.U. Days: Adventures in Digital Underground the Apprenticeship 
        of Tupac Shakur,&quot; will chronicle the turbulent times of the hip hop 
        super group. Chopmaster J and Abbott plan to take the viewer on a historic 
        tour recounting D.U.'s rise and fall. The film will recount a time when 
        the mega rap tour was in its heyday. From sold out US tours, to Tokyo 
        sex clubs, to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the young irreverent hip hop 
        band from the San Francisco Bay Area traveled to every corner of the world 
        entertaining millions of eager pop and hip hop music fans.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Abbott, 
        who directed, co-wrote and edited the platinum-selling, short film / music 
        video &quot;Streets is Watching,&quot; and directed the underground hip 
        hop cult classic, &quot;State Property,&quot; both starring hip hop icon 
        Jay Z, believes the documentary will play a crucial role in music history. 
        &quot;The movie is about the rise and fall of a would-be hip hop dynasty 
        during the 'Golden Age of Hip Hop,'&quot; he explains. &quot;But more 
        importantly, the film features the birth of the career of music giant, 
        Tupac Shakur. Fans who contribute to the Indiegogo crowdfunding effort 
        will play an important part in helping to document this significant time 
        in pop culture.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&quot;This 
        project will be a must have for any true hip hop head,&quot; adds Chopmaster 
        J. &quot;The inclusion of some of Tupac's never before released first 
        recordings are alone worth the price of admission!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Crowdfunding 
        participants can donate $5.00 and become a part of hip hop history while 
        collecting unique D.U. memorabilia! Monies raised will support the completion 
        of the documentary for a 2015 release.<br>

        School for Creative and Performing Arts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Budget 
        cuts resulted in the loss of 19 teachers and staff members since 2012. 
        Funding for clubs and extracurricular activities has been eliminated, 
        and the school's annual theater production was canceled.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I'm 
        taking this as a state of emergency,&quot; said Roots drummer Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; 
        Thompson. He and band member Tariq &quot;Black Thought&quot; Trotter formed 
        the band in 1987 after meeting at CAPA, regarded as Philadelphia's premiere 
        performing arts high school.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Roots are the house band for NBC's &quot;Tonight&quot; show. Other musical

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It 
        cultivated us. It educated us,&quot; Thompson said of CAPA. &quot;This 
        is more than just pay it forward or celeb guilt. This is necessary. ... 
        It keeps you out of trouble. It helps develop your personality. If you 
        take that away, you're just a machine.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Thompson 
        considered donating $1 million, but his manager persuaded him to use his 
        relationship with corporate sponsors. The drummer said there are a few 
        companies willing to help, and a &quot;substantial&quot; amount has been 
        donated, with &quot;seed money&quot; from Thompson and Trotter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        nonprofit organization aims to raise $500,000 annually for the first five

        Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant has parted ways with agent Eugene Parker 
        and joined JAY Zs Roc Nation sports management team. Bryant was represented 
        by Parker when he was drafted by the Cowboys in 2010, however, the two 
        parted ways and Bryant joined Drew Rosenhaus in Dec. 2011. <br>
        <br>
        Bryant then left Rosenhaus and rejoined Parker in Aug. 2012. Bryant, who 
        is in the final year of his rookie contract, is coming off his first Pro 
        Bowl appearance. Bryant said before the season started that he would table 
        negotiations if the two sides couldnt reach a long-term agreement by 
        Week 1. <br>
        <br>
        When asked last month about getting contract extensions done with Bryant 
        and Pro Bowl running back DeMarco Murray during the season, Cowboys chief 
        operating officer Stephen Jones said he wouldnt rule it out. I think 
        its very difficult, Jones said on 105.3 The Fan [KRLD-FM]. Everybodys 
        focused on the season at hand. You try to get some of those things done 
        early on. I would never rule it out. We would certainly sit down with 
        anybody at any time and see if something made sense. Our goal is to keep 
        good football players in our organization. <br>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        result shows that students who achieved above-average scores prefer music

        empire keeps expanding its reach: first Rutgers started a course devoted 
        to the singer; then Harvard Business School began to study her; now, a 
        radio station in Houston has rebranded itself as a Beyonce-only radio 
        station.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        station's website posted a statement announcing its closure: &quot;News92, 
        Houston&#146;s first FM all-news radio station aired its last broadcast 
        Wednesday, October 8, 2014... This difficult decision is a result of sustained 
        poor ratings performance and significant financial losses over the past 
        three years despite the substantial financial and human resources we invested.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Radio 
        One owns the station-formerly-known-as-News92. Yashima Azilove, who works

        what we know,&quot; Azilove told ABC13. &quot;We know urban radio. We're 
        in Houston, the combination seemed like a winning one.&quot; Well, it's 
        a win for Radio One and Beyonce at least -- 47 employees of the station 
        were laid off.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
        the new station only plays Beyonce's solo catalog, it will have five albums 
        to choose from. Not including various bonus tracks, remixes, live versions 
        or tracks from other artists featuring Beyonce, those records contain 
        63 songs, adding up to roughly 4 hours and 15 minutes of music. Of course, 
        if the station is willing to dig into Beyonce's work with Destiny's Child, 
        that will expand their pool of possible tunes to draw from -- Destiny's 
        Child recorded 5 albums (if you count their Christmas album), containing 
        67 songs and around 4.5 hours of music. <font size="1">Source: Billboard</font></font></p>

        Bros. Records (WBR) has announced that it has signed a global recording 
        contract with legendary rap group Wu-Tang Clan, including RZA, GZA, Method 
        Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa, and 
        Cappadonna. As a group, Wu-Tang has sold over 6.5 million records in the 
        US, while they've sold nearly 40 million records worldwide, including 
        individual members' album sales as well as group sales collectively. The 
        group's first release on the label will be the highly-anticipated 20th 
        anniversary album, A Better Tomorrow, which will be available December 
        2nd.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Wu-Tang 
        Clan said, &quot;Wu-Tang Clan is excited to join the Warner family of 
        esteemed artists. After 20 years in the business with different label 
        outlets, we are delighted to be amongst a team of industry professionals 
        who understand our unique artistry and will help spread it to the masses 
        unadulterated. RZA and his brother Divine CEO of Wu-Tang felt synergy 
        with executive/producer Rob Cavallo and Cameron Strang, and decided Warner 
        Bros. would be a suitable home for their brand and band, and a great place 
        to carry on the Wu-Tang saga. In the words of Ghostface, when it comes 
        to being signed to Warner Bros., 'we're getting Bugs Bunny money.'&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Cameron 
        Strang, Chairman &amp; CEO, Warner Bros. Records, told Billboard, &quot;Wu-Tang 
        Clan is responsible for creating a deep discography of iconic rap music, 
        spawning incredibly successful careers for each of the group's individual 
        members, and launching Wu-Tang into a full-fledged brand beyond their 
        music. Two decades on, they remain a major force in hip hop. I speak for 
        everyone on our team when I say how thrilled we are to be the new home 
        for one of hip hop's most influential groups. This is an exciting day 
        in the history of Warner Bros. Records, and we can't wait to contribute 
        to the next phase of their careers.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Over 
        the course of their career, the group has released five studio albums 
        and 19 compilation albums. Each of their first three albums-- Enter the 
        Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), Wu-Tang Forever and The W-have been certified platinum 
        by the RIAA, with Wu-Tang Forever having debuted at the No. 1 spot on 
        the Billboard 200.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Emerging 
        in 1993, the Staten Island, NY-based Wu-Tang Clan proved to be the most 
        revolutionary rap group of the mid-'90s. Turning the standard concept 
        of a hip-hop crew inside out, the Wu-Tang Clan were assembled as a loose 
        congregation of nine MCs. Instead of releasing one album after another, 
        the idea was to establish the Wu-Tang as a force with their debut album 
        and then spin off into as many side projects as possible. In the process, 
        the members all became individual stars. </font><br>

        continue to deliver a Millennial audience to cable providers across the

        a leader in portable audio, partnered with Robert &#147;RZA&#148; Diggs 
        from the Wu-Tang Clan to release the newest Boombot REX, featuring six 
        songs and two instrumental tracks from the currently unreleased Wu-Tang 
        Clan album, &#147;A Better Tomorrow.&#148; The collaboration began when 
        RZA approached Boombotix with the idea of embedding music into a Boombot 
        REX. The Boombot REX &#150; 20th Anniversary Wu-Tang Edition will be released 
        to the public in advance of the general release for &#147;A Better Tomorrow.&#148;</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Boombot 
        REXs feature advanced audio engineering and are tuned to meet the highest

        songs from the album, has a 50 percent increase in battery life compared 
        to previous models. With full Bluetooth integration, Boombot REXs give

        experiment in music exclusivity, the Boombot REX &#151; 20th Anniversary 
        Wu-Tang Edition is designed to spark conversation regarding the economics 
        of music in a climate of Internet piracy and streaming services. Instead 
        lining up outside stores for new releases, music fans access music from 
        the cloud or download it illegally. According to RZA, this process degrades 
        the artistic value of music and the immense amount of time devoted to 
        creating it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;To 
        me, there's something transcendent about being able to physically hold 
        music,&quot; said RZA. &quot;Back in the day, holding a vinyl helped you 
        appreciate just how much time and sweat an artist put into creating a 
        single track, let alone an entire album. Over the last decade, we've lost 
        that sensation. With this project, I hope to strengthen the bond between 
        fan and artist. Boombotix puts the artist back in your hands so you can 
        stay connected to your music.&quot;</font></p>

        DR. DRE TOPS FORBES CASH KINGS 2014 LIST<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Earlier 
        this year Apple AAPL +1.55% shelled out $3 billion to purchase Beats, 
        the company founded by Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre. Though the latter quickly 
        claimed to be hip-hop&#146;s first billionaire, a nine-figure tax bill 
        means that won&#146;t happen immediately&#151;but he&#146;s well on his 
        way.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        the meantime, Dre has been racking up plenty of other financial accomplishments. 
        His latest: capturing this year&#146;s hip-hop cash crown with pretax 
        earnings of $620 million. Not only is that the highest annual total of 
        any entertainer ever evaluated by FORBES, it&#146;s more than the combined 
        earnings of all 24 of his companions on the 2014 Hip-Hop Cash Kings list.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;It&#146;s 
        safe to say headphones is a good business,&#148; says DJ Khaled, who makes 
        his debut at No. 20 with estimated earnings of $7 million.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It&#146;s 
        a long way down to the No. 2 spot, where Diddy and Jay Z sit tied at $60 
        million. Hov&#146;s total is his highest since 2010, bolstered by a diverse 
        list of ventures including his growing Roc Nation empire ; 68 concerts 
        in our scoring period, D&#146;Uss&eacute; cognac and his latest album, 
        which was certified platinum before it was released due to an agreement 
        with Samsung to buy 1 million copies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Like 
        Jay Z, Diddy is still working as hard as ever to earn his $60 million 
        payday. His agreement with Diageo's Ciroc vodka accounts for the bulk 
        of those bucks, but he gets a boost from other ventures like DeLeon tequila, 
        Blue Flame marketing, Sean Jean clothing, and Revolt TV.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;I 
        love going where the hustle is,&#148; he told FORBES earlier this year. 
        &#147;I love going where like-minded people are.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One 
        person who could be counted in that category is Drake, who ranks fourth 
        with $33 million in earnings. His fourth studio album, Nothing Was the 
        Same, has sold about 4 million copies worldwide; additional checks from 
        an arena tour and endorsement deal with Nike&#146;s Jordan line have tripled 
        Drake&#146;s 2013 earnings of $10.5 million.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Macklemore 
        &amp; Ryan Lewis round out the top five with a combined $32 million. The 
        Seattle duo kicked off 2014 with a bang, winning four of the seven Grammy 
        awards for which they were nominated&#151;including Best New Artist and 
        Best Rap Album for The Heist. That type of acclaim has translated to big 
        bucks on the road, pushing the pair to more than triple last year&#146;s 
        $9 million take.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
        form this year&#146;s Cash Kings list, we considered income from touring, 
        record sales, publishing, merchandise sales, endorsements and other ventures. 
        Management, agent and attorney fees are not deducted. Earnings are calculated 
        from June 2013 to June 2014 and based on data from Pollstar, the RIAA 
        and Nielsen SoundScan, and from interviews with managers, lawyers, executives 
        and some of the artists themselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Another 
        highlight of the list: the inclusion of two newcomers, DJ Khaled and J. 
        Cole, who are tied for No. 20 with earnings of $7 million. New albums 
        in 2013&#151;Cole&#146;s Born Sinner and Khaled&#146;s Suffering From 
        Success&#151;and the live gigs that followed boosted both artists to the 
        greatest financial heights of their respective careers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;It 
        worked out even better than I imagined,&#148; said Cole. &#147;And I&#146;ll 
        leave it at that.&#148;</font></p>

        LAWSUIT AGAINST NICKI MINAJ DISMISSED.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        federal judge in Atlanta has tossed out a lawsuit filed against Nicki 
        Minaj by her former wig designer.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        a lawsuit in February, Terrence Davidson accused Onika Maraj, who uses 
        the stage name &quot;Nicki Minaj,&quot; and Pink Personality LLC of breaking 
        implied contracts, reneging on discussions to launch a reality TV show 
        and a wig line, and misappropriating his designs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lawyers 
        for Minaj filed a motion in May to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that Davidson 
        failed to state a valid claim.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">U.S. 
        District Judge Harold Murphy on Tuesday did just that. He agreed that 
        Davidson did not state viable claims against Minaj and Pink Personality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        lawyer for Davidson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment 
        Thursday.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Davidson, 
        who lives in Georgia, said in the lawsuit that he began working as Minaj's 
        hair stylist in early 2010. He created multiple wigs for the rapper, known 
        for her flamboyant hairpieces, that she wore to a preshow for MTV's Video 
        Music Awards, during media appearances in London and for the music video 
        &quot;SuperBass.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Davidson 
        said he turned down a contract for a reality TV show at the urging of 
        a Minaj representative. At the time, Davidson said he was discussing doing 
        a joint reality show with Minaj and launching a line of wigs with the 
        music star. But months passed, and Davidson said Minaj and her team shut 
        him out. He stopped working as her stylist in early 2013.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
        said Minaj took his designs without his consent and used them to start 
        her own wig line.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Minaj's 
        lawyers countered that Davidson &quot;is upset because he lost his most 
        famous client&quot; and was seeking to force himself into a business relationship 
        that Minaj and Pink Personality developed without him to get money from 
        them that he didn't earn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        judge wrote in his order that the verbal promises of future business Davidson 
        said he got from Minaj and her team were too vague and that it was unreasonable 
        for Davidson to rely on them as a done deal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        judge also wrote that Davidson claims his wigs are distinctive because 
        of their design and color and that there's no evidence that he made any 
        attempt to connect them to himself in the public mind or that anyone was 
        confusing the wigs sold by him with wigs sold by Minaj.</font></p>

        REPORTS RECORD-BREAKING REVENUE.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Broadcast 
        Music, Inc. has reported that it has achieved the highest revenues and 
        royalty distributions in the Company&#146;s 75-year history for its fiscal 
        year ended June 30th. BMI generated record revenues of $977 million, and 
        distributed and administered more than $840 million to its songwriters, 
        composers and music publishers. These results cap a ten-year period during 
        which BMI has generated more than $8 billion in revenues and distributed 
        royalties of more than $7.5 billion. BMI operates on a non-profit-making 
        basis and returns more than 85% of all revenue to the musical creators 
        and copyright owners it represents. A key to that sustained success has 
        been BMI&#146;s continuous drive to diversify its sources of revenue. 
        This year, the largest category of the Company&#146;s domestic revenue 
        was delivered by the steady-growth sectors of cable and satellite distributed 
        entertainment. Licensing income from digital services, international sources 
        and from businesses such as bars, hotels, fitness facilities and restaurants 
        all posted significant gains.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">BMI 
        President and Chief Executive Officer Michael O&#146;Neill said, &#147;We 
        are extremely pleased with these results and are already hard at work 
        trying to better them this year. BMI has a well-earned reputation as a 
        trusted broker between the creative community and businesses that perform 
        music to enhance their customer experience. In an ever-evolving marketplace 
        for music rights, our leadership, operational expertise and ability to 
        deliver value at so many different levels to our songwriters, composers, 
        publishers and licensees, enables us to maximize royalties for the creative 
        community.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        creativity and worldwide appeal of BMI&#146;s repertoire are unmatched 
        in today&#146;s marketplace. BMI singer/songwriters including Taylor Swift, 
        Adam Levine, Shakira, Miranda Lambert, P!nk and Nicki Minaj contributed 
        some of the most-performed songs of the year. Audiences were thrilled 
        by GRAMMY-winning hits from Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis, Daft Punk and 
        Nile Rodgers, Kacey Musgraves and Imagine Dragons, among others. BMI film 
        and television composers including James Newton Howard, Steve Jablonsky, 
        Mark Mothersbaugh, Brian Tyler and the legendary John Williams contributed 
        scores to the year&#146;s worldwide blockbusters and hit network and cable 
        television series. The Oscar-winning original song &#147;Let It Go,&#148; 
        from the highest-grossing animated film of all time, Disney&#146;s Frozen, 
        by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the charts in more 
        than 30 countries.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">BMI 
        has agreements with more than 650,000 licensees across all business sectors, 
        and the Company&#146;s licensing efforts during the year included almost 
        3 million outgoing sales calls followed up by more than 1 million pieces 
        of business correspondence. In administering the distributions of royalties, 
        the Company processed more than 500 billion copyright transactions during 
        the year, establishing values for each musical performance based on comprehensive 
        and proprietary metrics. BMI musical creators and copyright owners receive 
        the industry&#146;s most detailed statements of how, when and where their 
        music was performed, and how royalties are computed for those performances, 
        whether at home or abroad. Thousands of BMI affiliates now access this 
        information via BMI&#146;s suite of online apps for mobile devices. BMI&#146;s 
        songwriters, composers and publishers have always had the security of 
        knowing that it is the only major performing rights organization in the 
        United States that operates under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
        (GAAP).<br>

        Beverly Hills. Hosted by Lush One, with the live voice of FilmOn CEO Alki 
        David beamed in from Greece, the conference outlined the details of the 
        Dec. 6 battle -- including the announcement that it will take place at 
        Santa Monica Airport in Hanger 8 -- and served as a 'Lyrical Weigh-In' 
        to test the rappers' preparedness. </font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One 
        of hip hop's most revered genres, Battle Rap, has seen a resurgence in 
        recent years with the creation of Battle Rap TV on FilmOn Networks being 
        the most vital sign of its having achieved a new level. Cassidy is famous 
        as a pioneer of the genre who walked away more than ten years ago. Dizaster 
        is one of the rising stars to come out of the Fresh Coast Media Group 
        run by Lush One. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Cassidy's

        very pleased with the enthusiasm of the fans that turned out today,&quot; 
        said David. &quot;This is going to be a battle for the ages -- and will 
        introduce our new ETV platform for one of a kind event television.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        trash talk got brutal, with the crowd enjoying every insult and take down. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We 
        learned tonight there is far more genuine animosity between Diz &amp;

        CO-FOUNDER STARTS NEW AUDIO COMPANY.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">About 
        a week before Apple agreed to buy Beats for $3 billion, one of the company's 
        earliest employees filed a lawsuit against the headphone-maker, accusing 
        it of cutting him and others out of potentially millions in royalties. 
        That man is Steven Lamar. In his lawsuit, he claims that he came up with 
        the idea for Beats and was instrumental in developing three of its first 
        models, as well as the company's logo and branding.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now 
        Lamar has started another headphone venture aimed at eating Beats' lunch, 
        called Roam, and its first product is Ropes, $299 earbuds designed to 
        hang on your neck when you're not using them, like a fashion statement. 
        Lamar boldly says they also happen to be the best-sounding earbuds on 
        the market, with the most customizable sound.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While 
        much was made over the bass-heavy sound of Beats, Lamar is trying to define 
        Ropes with an adjustable five-band equalizer and presets for different 
        types of music, similar to what you'd find bundled in your phone or MP3 
        player's settings. The difference is that you can adjust the sound straight 
        to the headphones using a mobile app, then carry those presets to any 
        other device with an audio source.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Making 
        those changes to the sound involves plugging the earbuds into a small 
        pendant that dangles from the headphones, almost like a necklace. Inside 
        is a rechargeable battery, amp, and Bluetooth to let the headphones work 
        wirelessly. The pendant powers the sound into the headphones (which work 
        on their own when plugged in, though passively), as well as the EQ settings, 
        which can be adjusted through a companion app.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That 
        customization is key, Lamar says. &quot;Everybody is different. Everybody 
        hears things differently in the left ear than the right ear,&quot; he 
        says. &quot;I'm going to give you an app to personalize it the way you 
        want to hear it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lamar 
        admits that there's nothing particularly unique about the EQ presets that 
        will be offered in his company's app, but believes he's done it in a way 
        that people will not only use, but also want to share with others. &quot;It 
        means I am going to have a different setting on the phone for Beethoven 
        and the [Red Hot] Chili Peppers,&quot; he says. &quot;You can have different 
        settings for your listening habits, and you can share those settings with 
        your friends.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
        are some downsides for using a pendant, though. Despite the benefits you 
        get with turning wired earbuds wireless, it still takes juice. The battery 
        is rated for six hours of use, which is similar to what you get with other 
        wireless earbuds &#151; including an exercise pair made by Beats. After 
        that, you can still use the headphones plugged directly into an audio 
        source, but you'll miss out on the EQ settings. It also adds one more 
        dangling element if you plan to use Ropes and the pendant while exercising, 
        though Lamar says there is a clip that helps mitigates that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lamar 
        sees Ropes as a rebuke to the laziness he says has developed in the headphone 
        market. Picking up two different pairs of Beats headphones &#151; the 
        larger &quot;can&quot; style headphones and the earbuds &#151; in the 
        conference room where we're speaking, Lamar says this very important accessory 
        for listening isn't keeping up with the times.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Where's 
        the evolution? Smartphones evolve every six months to one year. Where 
        is that in this?&quot; he asks while holding up the Beats earbuds. &quot;We've 
        tolerated the shit they give us. But I like good sound, and we don't have 
        to have that crappy sound anymore.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Funnily 
        enough, Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine said something similar back in May 
        when talking about Apple's pack-in white headphones onstage at the Code 
        Conference. &quot;You listen to Apocalypse Now, and the helicopter sounds 
        like a mosquito,&quot; he said. The main difference, of course is price, 
        with Beats' entry-level headphones coming in at $99, or more than three 
        times the price Apple charges for its EarPods.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
        for how good Ropes will sound by comparison, you're going to have to take 
        Lamar's word for it &#151; at least for now. When we met last week, the 
        company was not ready with hardware it could demonstrate, and Lamar said 
        he'd be ready to show it off for real sometime later this month. In the 
        meantime, the company plans to have Ropes ready for the holiday season, 
        and is taking preorders from its online store, which will be the only 
        place to buy them. The company plans to branch out to other retail avenues, 
        and add additional models, including one Lamar described as &quot;very 
        fashion-forward.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lamar 
        eventually envisions Ropes reaching a level of popularity where people 
        will be able to spot them from across the room instantly, in a similar 
        fashion to Apple's white earbuds, and what ultimately happened with the 
        seemingly endless array of colors from Beats. That involves plans to offer 
        ropes in a large palette of colors beyond the silver-and-black, orange-and-gray 
        options available at launch. In the meantime though, Lamar thinks he's 
        already nailed the look.</font></p>

        have toured across the United States meeting many people with many musical 
        talents for years. One of the issues that we recognized on our travels 
        is that there is not enough marketing outlets for the indie artist that 
        you can trust. We plan to bridge a gap between the East, South, Midwest, 
        West and the many islands. We also cross lines of cultural barriers introducing 
        music to urban and Native American communities. Our goal for the Anaheim 
        Mixtape is for the artist to gain national recognition and sales. Driving 
        traffic to websites and building social communities is our second goal.&quot;

        BROWN PLEADS GUILTY.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Chris 
        Brown pleaded guilty on Tuesday to hitting a man outside a Washington 
        hotel, an assault that occurred while the singer was on probation for 
        attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown 
        pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to time served. 
        He spent two days in a District of Columbia jail in this case.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Grammy-winning singer was arrested in October. The victim told police 
        Brown hit him after he tried to get in a picture the singer was taking 
        with two women.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown 
        had previously pleaded not guilty in the case. His trial had been set 
        for April, but it was delayed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At 
        the time of his Washington arrest, Brown was on probation in a felony 
        assault case in California for attacking his then-girlfriend, pop star 
        Rihanna, hours before the 2009 Grammy Awards. Because Brown was still 
        on probation, the outcome of his Washington case had potential repercussions 
        in California. During a court hearing in May, a Los Angeles judge sentenced 
        Brown to serve an additional 131 days in jail. He was released in June.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown's 
        attorney, Danny Onorato, argued that Brown had already been punished extensively 
        for the assault, noting the time he spent in jail in California and four 
        months he spent receiving inpatient counseling after his probation was 
        revoked.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;To 
        say that he's been punished severely in this matter is an understatement,&quot; 
        Onorato said. He said Brown's career has been on hold for nearly a year 
        and he wanted to take responsibility for his actions so he could go back 
        to work, including a tour in support of a new album.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown 
        spoke only briefly, saying: &quot;I would like to say to the court that 
        I'm sorry.&quot; He did not comment as he left court, swarmed by photographers 
        and a handful of fans.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown's 
        bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, was also charged in the same Washington 
        scuffle. He was accused of being the second person after Brown to strike 
        Parker Adams outside the W hotel. Hollosy was convicted of misdemeanor 
        assault in April. He has not yet been sentenced.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brown, 
        24, had a squeaky clean image before his attack on Rihanna, but since 
        then he has had several flare-ups that have been reported to authorities 
        and noted by Los Angeles prosecutors. Brown broke a window after a 2011 
        &quot;Good Morning America&quot; interview in New York and was accused 
        of snatching a woman's cellphone in Miami after she tried to snap pictures 
        of the singer. He was also slightly injured in a New York nightclub brawl 
        and, earlier this year, was accused of being involved in a fistfight with 
        Frank Ocean's entourage over a parking spot at a West Hollywood recording 
        studio.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">-He 
        was not charged in any of the incidents, but they have tarnished his public 
        image, even as legions of fans continue to support him.</font></p>

        new outdoor music festival in downtown Los Angeles reflected the city's 
        diversity with a lineup that included rap, rock, punk, blues and Latin 
        music. Kanye West, Cypress Hill, Weezer, Rise Against, John Mayer and 
        Juanes were among Sunday's performers.</font></font></font></p>

        from the Budweiser Made in America festival's main stage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        two-day concert, held simultaneously with a sister show in Philadelphia, 
        featured more than 30 acts. Iggy Azalea, Metric, Kendrick Lamar and Imagine 
        Dragons took the stage Saturday in Los Angeles. The Philadelphia festival 
        included performers such as Kings of Leon, Tiesto and Pharrell Williams. 
        West and DJ Steve Aoki performed in both cities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">More 
        than 37,000 people attended the Los Angeles festival's second day in downtown's 
        Grand Park &#151; the first time the two-year-old park has been used for 
        a large, ticketed event. Authorities made 59 arrests Sunday &#151; including 
        four for narcotics-related felonies &#151; and cited 67 others for alcohol-related 
        offenses, Los Angeles Police spokesman Lt. Andy Neiman said. Nearly 50 
        people were treated for alcohol-related problems and released, and three 
        others were taken to a hospital for treatment, he added.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But 
        the music, food and festive atmosphere were the stars at LA's inaugural 
        Made in America festival. Here's a look:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">MUSIC: 
        Kanye brought the house down with a dramatic hour-long set to close out 
        the concert. He commanded the stage alone, donning two different spangled 
        face masks and injecting a bit of his trademark ranting into his abbreviated 
        performance. &quot;I know there's more people that love me than hate me,&quot; 
        he insisted. Mayer brought the day's folksy blues, playing several of 
        his hits, along with a cover of &quot;All Along the Watchtower.&quot; 
        Juanes did almost his entire set in Spanish, inspiring Latin dance moves 
        throughout the audience. Weezer delivered feel-good rock, along with news 
        of a new album in October and a preview of its first single. Rise Against 
        brought slam-dancing punk. Los Angeles natives Cypress Hill played 20-year-old 
        tunes to an enthusiastically receptive crowd. Singer B-Real smoked an 
        enormous joint onstage before urging California voters to &quot;legalize 
        it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mayor 
        Eric Garcetti, who championed the Made in America event and fast-tracked 
        it through city approvals, appeared onstage during Aoki's misplaced set 
        Sunday night. The mayor said nothing, while Aoki repeatedly implored the 
        crowd to &quot;make some noise.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        a statement Monday the mayor praised organizers and city departments for 
        making sure the event &quot;went off in an orderly and safe manner.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We 
        showed LA can do big things for our economy and people's enjoyment,&quot; 
        Garcetti said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Saturday's 
        highlights included a sexy performance by Azalea that featured rump-shaking 
        dancers and a surprise appearance by Rita Ora; a hit-packed set by Sublime 
        with Rome, whose singer sounds eerily similar to Sublime's late former 
        frontman Bradley Nowell; and a rousing performance by LA's own Lamar.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">FOOD: 
        Gourmet food trucks were stationed on the streets that span and surround 
        Grand Park. Hungry concertgoers could choose from Thai, Argentinian, Greek, 
        Japanese, Korean and American grub. There were also ice cream cookie sandwiches, 
        churros and shave ice. Unfortunately, lines stretched more than 20 diners 
        long at most trucks. Budweiser brews were available at various beer gardens 
        onsite for $14 a cup. No liquor was sold, but plenty of empty airplane-sized 
        booze bottles dotted the festival grounds. Also, there weren't enough 
        trash cans.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">ATMOSPHERE: 
        Los Angeles City Hall provided a stately backdrop for the concert's main 
        stage, the building's columns perfectly framing the performance space. 
        A second stage stood just adjacent, and acts alternated between the two. 
        There was a smaller, third stage on a different tier of the multi-level 
        park, plus a skate-park area that featured stunt skateboarders and a dance 
        DJ. Though crowds pooled around the food trucks and stages, Grand Park 
        offered enough space for attendees &#151; but not enough shade. Concertgoers 
        crammed under scant trees and tarps during the sunniest afternoon hours. 
        The audience was notably more diverse than those seen at the Coachella 
        or Stagecoach festivals, but the vibe was just as unified and festive. 
        The event's &quot;Made in America&quot; name even inspired sartorial patriotism 
        in some concertgoers, who wore red, white and blue.<br>

        1st at San Antonio's White Rabbit and then travel through late November 
        (see itinerary below). Ty is also busy completing work on his hugely anticipated

        in Irvine, CA. The Los Angeles-based artist has spent much of the past 
        year on the road, with highlights including a Stadium Stage set at the 
        2014 Hot 97 Summer Jam and his own wildly successful US run of &quot;The 
        Beach House Tour,&quot; with the international run kicking off on August 
        29th in Hanover and includes stops in London, Paris, Milan, Amsterdam 
        and more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ty 
        has fast become one of hip-hop's most highly demanded collaborators. Recent 
        highlights include Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa &amp; Ty Dolla $ign (Feat. Kill

        hit single from Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies' blockbuster

        single from Ty's acclaimed major label debut, &quot;BEACH HOUSE EP&quot; 
        -- has proven an undeniable smash. The single, which is rapidly approaching 
        Gold certification, exploded as the Most Added track at Urban radio outlets 
        nationwide upon its spring release before ascending the top 10 on the 
        iTunes Store's &quot;Top Hip-Hop/Rap Songs&quot; chart. In addition, the 
        &quot;Or Nah (Remix) (Feat. The Weeknd, Wiz Khalifa &amp; DJ Mustard)&quot; 
        companion video -- directed by Ryan Patrick -- is an online sensation, 
        drawing nearly 17 million individual views.</font></p>

        &quot;Paranoid (Feat. B.o.B),&quot; the EP's first breakout hit single,

        a top 5 Urban radio smash earlier this year while also crashing the top 
        10 on both Billboard's &quot;Hot R&amp;B Songs&quot; and &quot;Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop 
        Songs&quot; charts. The &quot;Paranoid&quot; companion video -- directed

        Records was founded in 1999 by Eminem, the biggest-selling artist in hip-hop 
        history, and his manager Paul Rosenberg. The first artist signed, D12, 
        hit double platinum and #1 with their debut album, Devil's Night. 2002 
        saw the soundtrack album to 8 Mile open with a #1 berth on the charts 
        and sell quadruple platinum, with &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; becoming the 
        first hip-hop song to win an Academy Award (Best Original Song). Shady 
        artist 50 Cent then debuted with the #1 Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), 
        an eight times platinum smash and the fastest-selling debut in history.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Shady 
        Reccords continued its streak with 50 Cent's next release, the #1 and 
        five times platinum The Massacre (2005) plus the platinum Curtis (2007) 
        and gold Before I Self Destruct (2009). D12 peaked at #1 again with the 
        double platinum D12 World (2004). Next came the various artists disc Eminem 
        Presents: The Re-Up (2006) earned #2 and platinum. The label also found

        was the reigning queen of Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards.<br>
        The diva closed the awards show with an epic nearly 20-minute performance. 
        Tears streamed down her face as she was joined onstage by her beaming 
        husband and daughter, amid the numerous rumors surrounding her marriage.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Beyonce 
        sang and danced in a metallic leotard while Blue Ivy and Jay Z watched 
        from their seats as the diva declared: &quot;MTV, welcome to my world.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
        Beyonce accepted the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award, the VMA's version 
        of a lifetime achievement award, at The Forum in Inglewood, California, 
        she kissed her daughter and husband Jay Z, who called her the &quot;greatest 
        living entertainer.&quot; The duo won best collaboration for the hit &quot;Drunk 
        In Love.&quot;</font></p>

        have nothing to say but I am filled with so much gratitude,&quot; she 
        told the cheering crowd as they chanted her name repeatedly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Her 
        performance easily outdid her competition throughout the night, though 
        Beyonce lost video of the year, which instead went to Miley Cyrus who 
        let a homeless man accept her award. It was in sharp contrast to the 2013 
        VMAs, when Cyrus twerked and danced shockingly onstage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Thank 
        y'all, my name is Jesse and I am accepting this award on behalf of the 
        1.6 million runaways and homeless youth in the United States who are starving, 
        lost and scared for their lives right now. I know this because I am one 
        of these people,&quot; he said, as a teary Cyrus looked on. &quot;Though 
        I may have been invisible to you in the streets, I have a lot of the same 
        dreams that brought many of you here tonight.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Cyrus' 
        decision to let someone else accept her award to promote a cause was reminiscent 
        of Marlon Brando's 1973 Academy Awards best actor win, when he gave a 
        Native American activist the stage rather than accept his Oscar trophy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        two-hour show was tamer than past VMAs: the most shocking moment was Nicki 
        Minaj's rump-shaking during her performance of &quot;Anaconda&quot; in 
        the show's first minutes and her wardrobe malfunction when she joined 
        Ariana Grande and Jessie J for &quot;Bang, Bang.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It

        zipped up,&quot; Minaj said backstage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Taylor 
        Swift was a crowd favorite when she performed her new single &quot;Shake 
        It Off&quot; in shimmery, fringed shorts and a crop top. She got to the 
        top of the stage, and as her tuxedoed male background dancers stood with 
        their arms wide open waiting for Swift to jump she said, &quot;One second. 
        I don't care if it's the VMAs. I'm not jumping off there.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She 
        continued: &quot;It's all kinds of people getting bitten by snakes. Dangerous.&quot;</font></p>

        who held hands with rapper Big Sean backstage, kicked off the show with 
        a performance of her EDM hit, &quot;Break Free&quot; in a Beyonce-inspired 
        leotard. The 21-year-old won best pop video for her smash single &quot;Problem,&quot; 
        but lost best female video to Katy Perry, who won for &quot;Dark Horse.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Perry 
        sported a figure-hugging denim dress and was joined by Riff Raff in a

        a moment of silence for Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old who was 
        fatally shot by a police officer on Aug. 9, before he presented the award 
        for best hip-hop video.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Hip-hop 
        has always been about truth and has been a powerful instrument of social 
        change, from Melle Mel to Public Enemy to Kendrick Lamar,&quot; Common

        Whatever you hold sacred isn't above aggressive inquiry. The album displays 
        their undeniable synergy. When Ras Kass crucifies supposed facts over 
        Apollo's beats, it's clear he is the West Coast's preeminent philosopher. 
        When Apollo's blaring suites soothe your soul, it's an ontological fact

        in 2012 on Mike's R.A.P. Music album (produced by El-P) and El's Cancer

        such as from A-Plus' Molly's Dirty Water, Phesto's Infared Rum and Casual's 
        group project entitled The School System. The crew also recently released 
        an animated video for their track &quot;Golden,&quot; which morphs the

        from Pep Love and Souls of Mischief nearing, the group will be performing 
        new songs, never heard before in front of a live audience. In addition 
        to what has turned out to be an amazing year, the Hieroglyphics are gearing

        Souls of Mischief, who are releasing their epic sixth studio album, There

        shows. There Is Only Now is an epic work of art that demonstrates the 
        group's dedication, discipline, and level of skill rarely seen today in 
        rap. Recorded and produced by Adrian Younge without the use of a single 
        computer, the concept album was created like a blaxploitation film, complete 
        with a storyline, narration, and live instrumentation only. Souls of Mischief

        Hieroglyphics crew, known as pioneers of independent hip-hop, is made 
        up of members Del The Funky Homosapien, Casual, Pep Love, Domino, and 
        Souls of Mischief, who include A-Plus, Opio, Phesto, Tajaj. Not only are 
        they considered to be one of the first hip-hop artist collectives to start 
        their own record label, but they introduced a different side of hip hop 
        that was virtually unknown on a mainstream level. When Elektra Records 
        signed Del the Funky Homosapien and JIVE signed Souls of Mischief in the 
        early '90s, the Hiero crew soon became internationally known as the leaders 
        of a new movement in rap that represented peace and unity, despite having 
        come from a city rife with violent crime. Considered to be some of the 
        most highly skilled lyricists in rap from their inception to today, the 
        Hiero crew continued to break hip-hop norms with personal, emotional rhymes 
        rather than solely gangster-rap. Souls Of Mischief's &quot;93 'Til Infinity&quot; 
        remains one of the most respected and well-known hip-hop classics, referred 
        to in pop culture time and time again. The third eye logo, designed by 
        Del, was ranked as the 3rd most recognizable music logo by Rolling Stone 
        Magazine, and it is not uncommon for fans to show Hiero members their 
        third eye logo tattoos.</font></p>

        Mane, whose real name is Radric Davis, was sentenced to 39 months in federal 
        prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to a firearms charge.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Davis, 
        who has been in custody for 11 months awaiting resolution of the case, 
        will have to serve 28 months before being released on three years probation. 
        Davis asked the judge to recommend he serve his sentence in a west coast 
        prison with a drug rehab program to allow him to get away from local influences 
        in Atlanta.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        charge, related to two incidents in September, carries a maximum penalty 
        of 10 years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000, but prosecutors recommended 
        that Davis be sentenced to serve three years and three months in prison. 
        Sentencing is set for July, his attorney said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Davis, 
        who was indicted in November, has remained incarcerated since the September 
        incidents.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">According 
        to the indictment, on Sept. 12, Davis had a Taurus 45-caliber handgun 
        and eight rounds of ammunition. Two days later, a friend concerned about 
        the rapper&#146;s behavior called Atlanta police.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">About 
        1 a.m. Sept. 14, authorities found Davis walking near Moreland and East 
        Confederate avenues, and Davis became &#147;increasingly agitated with 
        officers and began cursing and threatening them.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        officers arrested Davis and discovered he was carrying a handgun and small 
        amount of marijuana, police said at the time. The federal indictment claims 
        he was in possession of a Glock 40-caliber handgun and 11 rounds of ammunition.<br>
        U.S. District Court Judge Steve Jones, a self professed Four Tops fan, 
        said he was unfamiliar with Davis&#146; music but added, &#147;&#148;young 
        people &#150; my nieces and nephews &#150; tell me you are quite cool.&#148;

        </font></b><br>
        The Smoker's Club has just announced their line-up and dates for their 
        5th annual tour kicking off October 14 in Providence, RI at Lupo's Heartbreak 
        Hotel. The world's largest hot-box will be headlined by multi-platinum 
        recording artists METHOD MAN &amp; REDMAN with a supporting cast of B-REAL 
        (from the Grammy nominated Cypress Hill), Taylor Gang's BERNER, and new 
        Cinematic artist MICK JENKINS. The 37-city US Tour will wrap up November 
        26th at New York City's Best Buy Theater. Tickets go on-sale Friday, August 
        15th at 10am EST.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Launched in 2010 by 
        Cinematic Music Group Founder Jonny Shipes, Steven &quot;Steve-O&quot; 
        Brown, Shiest Bubz, and recording artist Smoke DZA, The Smoker's Club 
        Tour has flourished into one of the most successful independent concert 
        tours in the world. The tour has featured performers such as Big K.R.I.T, 
        Curren$y, Method Man, Juicy J, Joey Bada$$, Ab Soul and others. After 
        the success of the first show at the South by Southwest Music Festival 
        in 2010, all four founders saw the potential and never looked back. Fast 
        forward to 2014 and the tour has reached its five year anniversary.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Method Man and Redman have been staples in my playlists since I 
        can remember. I have probably smoked 5 lbs of weed listening to their 
        music &amp; watching &quot;How High&quot; on repeat during my life, LOL. 
        It was a no brainer &amp; honor to have them headline this year's tour,&quot; 
        says Smoker's Club founder Jonny Shipes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Smoker's Club 
        Tour will also feature: B-Real, Berner, and Mick Jenkins. B-REAL has led 
        Cypress Hill as one of the biggest global hip hop groups ever with over 
        18 million albums sold, three Grammy nominations and an MTV Award. With 
        a co-sign from Wiz Khalifa, BERNER has established himself as a legitimate 
        musical entity in Taylor Gang while developing and promoting his passion 
        for marijuana. With his love for all things weed, Berner couldn't have 
        found himself on a more appropriate tour. Upstart MICK JENKINS has been 
        making waves in the Chicago rap scene since the release of his Trees &amp; 
        Truths mixtape last year. Propelled by the success of &quot;Martyrs&quot; 
        (where Mick outspokenly speaks on the state of Chicago), Mick is full 
        steam ahead with his second project The Water[s] which just released on 
        August 12th, along with the recent announcement of his signing to Cinematic 
        Music Group.<br>

        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill pleaded to be released from jail Monday 
        to resume his music career and support his son and 30-person entourage, 
        but the judge who jailed him on a parole violation last month was unmoved.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She 
        ordered the 27-year-old to take anger management classes for what prosecutors 
        called a parole office &quot;tantrum&quot; over travel restrictions, and 
        a Twitter rant aimed at a parole officer and prosecutor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I 
        wanted him to be able to grow and get to the next level (of his career),&quot; 
        Common Pleas Judge Genese Brinkley said. &quot;But I can't do that with 
        him thumbing his nose at me.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mill, 
        born Robert Williams, has been on probation for about five years following 
        a 2009 drug and gun case conviction, for which he served about a year 
        of house arrest. He has since emerged as a gifted rapper who has been 
        tapped to perform with Jay-Z.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But 
        his career has been interrupted the past two years by what he considers 
        an increasingly fraught relationship with a new parole officer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We 
        never clicked 100 percent,&quot; Mill said Monday, his voice sounding 
        ready to crack.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
        has not committed any new crimes while on probation, but was flagged this 
        year after failing a drug test and appearing to use a gun in a music video. 
        Defense lawyer Dennis Cogan said Mill had a prescription for the OxyContin 
        after spraining his ankle, and said the video prop was a water pistol.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
        also said his client's tweets, however unwise, were protected by the First 
        Amendment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;You 
        never said, 'As a condition of probation, you can't speak outside the 
        courtroom about the district attorney or the probation officer,'&quot; 
        Cogan argued to the judge.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
        has asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and grant bail.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        prison official, a music promoter and a professor of race relations spoke 
        on Mill's behalf Monday, and spoke of the difficulty of growing up fatherless 
        &#151; Mill's father was killed when he was young &#151; and staying out 
        of the crosshairs of the parole system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It's 
        not set up for a man to win in society &#151; a black man,&quot; said 
        local music promoter and mentor Charles Alstin, known as Charlie Mack.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mill, 
        lean, lanky and baby-faced, has been kept in protective custody at Curran-Fromhold 
        Correctional Facility, but complained Tuesday that his neighbors on the 
        high-security block are rapists and murderers. He also questioned whether 
        he would be able to take the required anger management class there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brinkley 
        said she had called the warden last week about the plan. She agreed to 
        rescind her protective custody order, but warned Cogan &quot;if something 
        happens ... it's going to be on you.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mill 
        released his debut album, &quot;Dreams &amp; Nightmares,&quot; in late 
        2012.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        album's launch party was delayed when Mill and three others &#151; including 
        an Atlantic Records executive and a police officer friend &#151; were 
        stopped in a Range Rover and detained by Philadelphia police for several 
        hours. No drugs were found and no charges filed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Meek 
        sued the city over the arrest, but a mostly-white federal jury in Philadelphia 
        this spring rejected the civil rights lawsuit.<br>

        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Southern 
        rap fans mourned the loss of one of their heroes when UGK producer/rapper 
        Chad &#147;Pimp C&#148; Butler was found deceased in an upscale Hollywood 
        hotel room. But much like the real story of the days leading up to this 
        tragic event, most of this enigmatic musician&#146;s life has remained 
        a mystery, relegated to rumors and entertaining tales relayed in late-night 
        studio sessions while the truth is lost to the hands of time. Until now.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Under 
        the guidance of Pimp C&#146;s beloved mother and manager Weslyn &#147;Mama 
        Wes&#148; Monroe, former OZONE Magazine Publisher and Editor-in-Chief 
        Julia Beverly brings the charismatic entertainer back to life in an upcoming 
        biography, recreating both the highs and lows of his life and career in 
        vivid detail. The book includes a foreword by rapper Too $hort and is 
        based on in-depth interviews with 250 of Pimp C&#146;s family members, 
        friends, and collaborators including UGK partner Bun B, Snoop Dogg, Three 
        6 Mafia, 8Ball &amp; MJG, the Geto Boys, Master P, David Banner, Slim 
        Thug, Paul Wall, Ice-T, Goodie Mob, Lil Keke, Z-Ro, Trae, Webbie, Mannie 
        Fresh, and many more. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Prior 
        to his untimely passing, Pimp C was a regular correspondent for OZONE 
        Magazine, first with the &#147;Prison Diaries&#148; series and later with 
        his controversial monthly column &#147;The Chronicles of Pimp C.&#148; 
        The book also utilizes numerous interviews he did with Beverly, whom he 
        once christened &#147;the only media person I talk to.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">&#147;People 
        often remember Pimp C for his flamboyant style and controversial interviews, 
        but few understand just how complex and talented he was and how connected 
        he was to the success of many other artists,&#148; Beverly says. &#147;Initially, 
        I felt this was an important project because he hadn&#146;t received a 
        proper tribute. The more I researched, I realized his story is one that 
        needs to be told, and I&#146;m in the perfect position to tell it.&#148; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 
        addition to being a compelling biography, the project also serves as a 
        historical record of the era documented in UGK&#146;s music. In telling 
        Pimp C&#146;s story, the book explores Houston&#146;s dynamic music culture, 
        the pitfalls of the entertainment industry, the economics and racial disparity 
        of the massive Texas Criminal Justice system, the realities of the pimp/prostitute 
        subculture and human trafficking, the hazards of drug abuse and much more.</font></p>

        police in Ferguson broke their weeklong silence on Friday and identified 
        the officer involved in the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American 
        teenager, saying that the teenager was believed to have taken part in 
        a robbery at a nearby convenience store shortly before the shooting.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson, said the officer was Darren Wilson, 
        a six-year veteran of the force who had no disciplinary actions taken 
        against him. Chief Jackson did not disclose any other information about 
        the officer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Chief 
        Jackson said that Officer Wilson had been alerted to the robbery shortly 
        before the encounter with the teenager, Michael Brown, 18, who was walking 
        home from a store on Saturday when he was shot.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Ferguson police released security camera video after the news conference 
        that showed a confrontation inside the store about 15 minutes before Saturday&#146;s 
        shooting. The images show a man, identified by the police as Mr. Brown, 
        who appears to be pushing a store clerk.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        police said that Mr. Brown, who was in the store with a friend, had stolen 
        a box of Swisher Sweets cigars. When confronted by the clerk, Mr. Brown 
        &#147;forcefully pushed him back into a display rack&#148; before leaving, 
        a police report said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        release of the police report was met with renewed anger by residents of 
        Ferguson, who said they believed the disclosure was an attempt to justify 
        the shooting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Captain 
        Ron Johnson, the Highway Patrol official who is heading security in Ferguson,

        officer in broad daylight.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;The

        the way that the police are handling the distribution of information,&#148; 
        Mr. Crump said. &#147;The police are not being transparent and they are 
        strategically trying to justify this execution-style murder.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mr. 
        Brown&#146;s death had ignited several days of protests that have been

        of demonstrators.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Earlier,

        lot of the stakeholders had a big meeting conversation yesterday, and

        revenue growth by U.S. based programmers (and international services conducting

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hip-Hop 
        Culture, in its 41st year of existence, has come a very long way. From 
        parties in the park in the Bronx, NY, all the way to the smallest town 
        in the far reaches of the globe, Hip-Hop Culture is the driving force 
        that has shaped a generation. We must take time out to step back, observe, 
        and see what we all have contributed to this vast and genius culture through 
        the avenues of innovation, industry, commerce, education, and technology. 
        It is very safe to say that there is nothing Hip-Hop Culture can't touch, 
        shape, form, or influence. In my 32 years of being a fan, a participant, 
        and a protector of our culture, I am very proud to see the road we all 
        have traveled. We've come from so many vessels and all walks of life, 
        placing our own imprint on the culture, while also continuing to push 
        the culture forward. We are indeed, building an institution. Record sales, 
        money, and all material things may come and go, but it is the institution 
        that is being built by all of us that will make this culture stand the 
        test of time.<br>
        <br>
        This year, as we celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the A3C Festival in 
        Atlanta, GA, let's continue to build on the foundation of that very institution. 
        At A3C, let's continue to learn, grow, incite, educate, push, and influence 
        the next generation of artists, to assure that the institution and the 
        culture of Hip-Hop will never waver or fall, and that it continues to 
        get stronger for years to come. For some of you this will be your first 
        time coming to A3C, so we say welcome! For those who have been to A3C 
        year after year and have seen it grow from one room and one stage to taking 
        over Atlanta, we say thank you for believing in the vision. Thank you 
        for adding to the cornerstones of the house of A3C, that indeed we all 
        have help build.</font></p>

        J and DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia, the Oscar-winning southern rap group formed 
        in 1991, and their label businesses (Select-O-Hits, S.A.T. Entertainment 
        Music and Scale-A-Thon Entertainment) have been accused by Reggie Boyland, 
        a rap label owner (of On The Strength Records and Bank Bag Publishing), 
        of copyright infringement. The suit was filed by Boyland Aug. 7th in Atlanta 
        District Court.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        complaint claims that two songs that Boyland controls, &quot;Pimps In 
        The House&quot; and &quot;Listen to the Lyrics,&quot; both performed and 
        written by the rap duo 8Ball &amp; MJG on their debut record Listen To 
        The Lyrics, were involved in several infringing copyrights by Three 6 
        Mafia, beginning in 1996. Boyland filed copyright applications for the 
        songs in May of this year. The suit does not mention any remuneration 
        for 8Ball or MJG that would result from the lawsuit, nor do they seem 
        to be involved in the case in any way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        pair collaborated with Three 6 Mafia previously on the song &quot;Stay 
        Fly,&quot; released in 2005.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First, 
        Boyland claims that Three 6 Mafia sampled &quot;Listen to the Lyrics&quot; 
        on its second album Chapter 1: The End, in the song &quot;Where Da Bud,&quot; 
        which was re-released in Nov., 2013 under the title &quot;Where Da Bud 
        At?&quot; Second, that Three 6 Mafia's sampling of 8Ball &amp; MJG's &quot;Pimps 
        in the House&quot; on its third album, Chapter 2: World Domination, was 
        licensed at the time of its release, but that a five-year agreement expired 
        in 2002. Third, that the compilation record Three 6 Mafia Presents: Hypnotize 
        Camp Posse samples &quot;Listen to the Lyrics&quot; on the song &quot;Fie 
        It On Up.&quot; Fourth, that a version of &quot;Where the Bud At?&quot; 
        titled &quot;Where's Da Bud Part 2,&quot; included on Three 6 Mafia's 
        Greatest Hits, also improperly sampled &quot;Listening to the Lyrics.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Fifth, 
        that Three 6 Mafia's songs containing samples of Boyland's copyrights 
        were licensed and sampled themselves by other artists, adding a layer 
        of meta-complexity to the relatively straightforward case.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        complaint seeks an unspecified amount in damages, as well as an injunction 
        against the defendants' sale of the infringing works, as well as attorney's 
        fees, from Juicy J, DJ Paul, Select-O-Hits, S.A.T. Entertainment Music

        E-40&#146;S WINE IS A SELL-OUT.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On 
        the streets, he&#146;s known as E-40, a Vallejo rapper who has spent more 
        than two decades hustling in the hip-hop game. But in the world of wine, 
        E-40 goes by his birth name, Earl Stevens, and his line of wines has scored 
        a surprise smash hit in the ultra-competitive beverage industry.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">E-40 
        has turned into the Robert Mondavi of hip-hop via his Earl Stevens Selections. 
        His three wines include a red blend called &#147;Function,&#148; a moscato 
        and high-alcohol fortified wine called &#147;Mangoscato.&#148; Since their 
        October release, sales of E-40&#146;s wines are already on par with such 
        supermarket stalwarts as Rodney Strong and Ferrari-Carano. Earl Stevens 
        Selections have sold more than 180,000 bottles in Northern California 
        this year, an astonishing amount for a new wine brand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;I&#146;ve 
        always loved wine,&#148; said Stevens, in a phone call from his Bay Area 
        home. &#147;Sometimes you&#146;ve got to roll the dice, but I had a good 
        vibe about it. We&#146;re making progress.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        voice behind such West Coast classics as &#147;Yay Area&#148; and &#147;Sprinkle 
        Me&#148; has become an unlikely ambassador of fermented grapes, a guy 
        who&#146;s usually more aligned with the rapper Too $hort than winemakers 
        like Bob Trinchero. Many upstart vintners could only dream of creating 
        the sales buzz E-40 is enjoying. A bottle-signing event at Costco on Arden 
        Way in March drew nearly 1,000 fans, and the distributor for Earl Stevens 
        Selections initially struggled to keep up with demand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Earl 
        Stevens Selections is finding traction not only in a competitive wine 
        industry, but in a market that&#146;s already crowded with celebrity brands, 
        whether they&#146;re bottle lines launched by KISS, Carlos Santana, Fergie 
        or the rapper Lil Jon. Few of them have matched the success of Earl Stevens 
        Selections. E-40 raps about street life, but he&#146;s also a taste-maker 
        and entrepreneur whose wine is designed as more than a mere vanity project. 
        He hopes to establish Earl Stevens Selections as a bona fide supermarket 
        brand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;I&#146;m 
        a wine drinker,&#148; Stevens said. &#147;It&#146;s one of those drinks 
        that was always around. Any rapper can have a wine and say, &#145;Hey, 
        buy it.&#146; But you have to be a person who&#146;s real out there. I&#146;m 
        street dude but I&#146;m a person you can walk up to and approach.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        46-year-old rapper has been synonymous with West Coast hip-hop since the 
        early 1990s. E-40 might not have the same kind of familiarity with Middle 
        America as Jay-Z or Kanye West, but his reputation as a lyrical stylist 
        and musical innovator is well cemented, having earned notoriety as figurehead 
        of the the early 2000s &#147;hyphy&#148; movement, a boisterous Bay-Area 
        rap style.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">E-40 
        is credited for his numerous contributions to hip-hop&#146;s vernacular, 
        a kind of early influencer whose contributions later filter into more 
        mainstream pop culture. If you&#146;ve ever said &#147;You feel me?&#148; 
        or &#147;fo&#146; shizzle,&#148; you&#146;ve parroted E-40.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Known 
        for a prodigious musical output,including releasing three albums in 2012, 
        and four albums expected to drop this month, he&#146;s also registered 
        high on the charts. In 2006, his record &#147;My Ghetto Report Card&#148; 
        debuted at No. 1 on Billboard&#146;s R&amp;B/hip-hop albums.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;He&#146;s 
        the king of the Bay,&#148; said Billy Jam, a historian of Bay Area rap 
        and founder of Hip-Hop Slam Records. &#147;It&#146;s not like he&#146;s 
        some guy coming back from 1995. He&#146;s stayed relevant to all ages, 
        and E-40 clearly influenced a generation because of the slang. Not only 
        has he influenced people&#146;s taste, but other rappers. It&#146;s a 
        Bay thing.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">E-40 
        has long paired his music with entrepreneurship. He launched a line of 
        40 Water energy drinks in 2007, and opened a string of Wingstop franchises 
        in Vallejo and other cities around the 707 area code. He&#146;s also shown 
        a particular affinity for alcohol. The &#147;40&#148; in his moniker refers 
        to a fondness for 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor, and he&#146;s sprinkled 
        wine references into his tracks since 1993&#146;s &#147;Carlos Rossi&#148; 
        &#150; an ode to the jug wine Carlo Rossi. E-40 also became a face of 
        Landy Cognac in 2008.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">His 
        move into wine makes geographical sense; his Vallejo stomping grounds 
        are only about 20 minutes from Napa. His mom worked for 14 years at Napa 
        State Hospital.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;Both 
        Vallejo and Napa are (in the) 707 (area code),&#148; Stevens said. &#147;When 
        I was 23 going on 24, me and my wife used to go on the Napa Wine Train 
        all the time. In 1993, I had a song called &#145;Practice Lookin&#146; 
        Hard&#146; that said instead of work at the oil refinery, I&#146;d rather 
        work in Napa at the winery.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While 
        his longevity in the music biz and his loyal fan base have certainly contributed 
        to its popularity, Earl Stevens Wines are marketed with everyday consumers 
        in mind. There&#146;s no likeness of E-40 &#150; with his signature bifocals 
        &#150; on the label, and no wording that states &#147;E-40.&#148; The 
        bottle design includes &#147;Earl Stevens&#148; written in a stately font 
        and a regal crest that incorporates the 707 area code.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;The 
        way something looks has a lot to do with your future sales,&#148; Stevens 
        said. &#147;(People) think that just because I&#146;m a rapper, the bottle 
        will have musical notes. But this (bottle) looks like it&#146;s been around 
        for 100 years. Rodney Strong and Kendall-Jackson, those are successful 
        brands. If they can do that, why not Earl Stevens?&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        bottle style of Earl Stevens Selections ideally speaks to both his longtime 
        fans as well as to anyone simply looking for an affordable wine. The wines 
        are $9.99 to $15.99.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;A 
        lot of his (fans) were listening to E-40 in 1992, and fast forward 20 
        years later, those are the same people who are looking for a bottle of 
        wine to take home,&#148; Jam said. &#147;Let&#146;s face it. With so many 
        wine choices, sometimes people just go by &#133; the bottle. There&#146;s 
        name recognition here.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Earl 
        Stevens Selections were created by Steve Burch, a UC Davis alum who works 
        as a winemaker-for-hire for various projects. Burch developed Mangria, 
        a fortified red wine brand conceived by comedian Adam Carolla, and crafted 
        an upcoming wine for pop singer Michelle Branch.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Burch 
        knows how difficult it is to create a hit wine, even with a celebrity 
        connection, and to compete on supermarket shelves with established brands. 
        But Earl Stevens Selections, he said, has surpassed expectations, with 
        upward of 8,000 cases selling in a month.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;Winemakers 
        dream about that kind of success,&#148; said Burch, who owned the now-defunct 
        Burch Hall Winery in Grass Valley. &#147;I&#146;d be happy to do the kind 
        of sales in five years that (Earl Stevens Selections) has done in six 
        months. It&#146;s absolutely insane, but that&#146;s what makes it fun.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        next challenge is sustaining those kind of sales. &#147;There&#146;s always 
        a risk of something like this to have a novelty appeal,&#148; Burch said. 
        &#147;My feeling was you might buy the first bottle because it&#146;s 
        Earl, but you&#146;ll buy the second because you like it.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Burch 
        initially created the wines at Napa-based California Shiners. Production 
        has shifted to DFV Wines, the parent company of Delicato, Gnarly Head 
        and others. With 7 million in annual case sales in 2013, the Manteca-based 
        operation ranked as the country&#146;s eighth-largest wine company by 
        Wine Business Monthly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        grapes in Earl Stevens Selections come primarily from California&#146;s 
        Central Valley, including the moscato. Wines made of this sweet white 
        grape found its sales spike starting in 2009, after being name checked 
        in hip-hop songs by Drake, Lil&#146; Kim and others.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Function 
        Red Blend is a mix of Lodi zinfandel and cabernet. Retailing for $9.99, 
        it&#146;s crafted with segments of French oak in large tanks, versus spending 
        extensive time in small barrels. Burch&#146;s goal was to create a consumer-friendly 
        wine using methods to keep down costs and speed up production.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;It 
        all comes down to who&#146;s buying your wine,&#148; said Burch. &#147;I 
        love Earl and he has a great fan base, but not a single one of them gives 
        a you-know-what if it&#146;s 55 percent cabernet sauvignon or 58 percent. 
        I know winemakers who will agonize over that decision, and in the process 
        waste a lot of time.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Southern 
        Wine &amp; Spirits, a leading distributor, added Earl Stevens Selections 
        to its portfolio in January. According to Paul Thompson, vice president 
        and regional sales director for Southern Wine &amp; Spirits, the supply 
        of wines couldn&#146;t keep up with demand in those early months.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Earl 
        Stevens Selections quickly became one of the fastest-growing brands, he 
        said, adding $2 million in gross sales to its distributor. Those sales 
        dwarfed other celebrity wines carried by Southern Wine &amp; Spirits, 
        including Bethenny Frankel&#146;s Skinny Girl wines and Save Me, San Francisco, 
        a wine by the rock group Train. Earl Stevens Selections are now a staple 
        in Northern California supermarkets and bottle shops, including BevMo!, 
        Total Wine &amp; More, Coscto and SaveMart.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;It&#146;s 
        been phenomenal,&#148; Thompson said. &#147;It just took off and we couldn&#146;t 
        keep up &#150; and really, it&#146;s just getting started.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Mangoscato has emerged as the runaway favorite. Of the 15,000 cases of 
        Stevens wine distributed since the beginning of the year by Southern Wine 
        &amp; Spirits, about 10,000 of those sales have been for the Mangoscato, 
        the fruity fortified wine. The remaining 3,000 of case sales have gone 
        toward the Function Red Blend, and 2,000 cases of the moscato.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mangoscato 
        isn&#146;t geared for fine dining or to win over wine judges. At 18 percent 
        alcohol, Mangoscato &#147;packs a punch,&#148; said Thompson. &#147;We 
        recommend you pour it over ice as you would a cocktail. It&#146;s more 
        than a wine or a dessert wine. It&#146;s a cocktail and made to be consumed 
        that way.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Burch 
        said Stevens took a hands-on approach to the wine-making process, doing 
        more than simply slapping his name on the label. The rapper participated 
        in blending and tasting sessions, noting if one approach to the red blend 
        was too puckery, while keeping a keen eye on the packaging.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;He&#146;s 
        a very detail-oriented guy and certainly had input on the wines as we 
        created them,&#148; Burch said. &#147;At one point, the company that printed 
        labels for us had trouble with the foil. The impression wasn&#146;t as 
        deep on some labels as others. The only person who caught that was Earl.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Given 
        the out-the-box success of Earl Stevens Selections, three wine styles 
        doesn&#146;t look to be enough. There&#146;s already talk of expanding 
        this line of wines in the near future, and maybe branch into other adult 
        beverages.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">E-40 
        credits Carlo Rossi for being his gateway wine, in both his appreciation 
        of the beverage and its business.</font></p>

        RULING VACATED IN JAY Z CASE.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
        federal judge vacated an order that found an Egyptian man's copyright 
        infringement claims against Jay-Z's &quot;Big Pimpin'&quot; are barred 
        under a legal doctrine used to dismiss unreasonably delayed lawsuits.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">U.S. 
        District Judge Christina Snyder issued the ruling on July 21, in light 
        of the U.S. Supreme Court's May 2014 rulingin Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 
        a copyright battle over authorship of the screenplay to the 1980s Martin 
        Scorsese classic &quot;Raging Bull.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a 9th Circuit ruling that 
        the plaintiffs could not make a damages claim against MGM under the doctrine 
        of laches, which allows courts to dismiss claims where there is an unwarranted 
        delay in filing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Snyder 
        had ruledin December 2011 that the statute of limitations barred plaintiff 
        Osama Ahmed Fahmy from seeking damages for infringement before Aug. 31, 
        2004, or three years before Fahmy sued Jay-Z and several other defendants 
        including EMI. But the judge gave the green light for a trial to settle 
        the case.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Fahmy 
        is the nephew of the late Egyptian composer Baligh Hamdy, who composed 
        &quot;Khosara, Khosara,&quot; which was sampled on &quot;Big Pimpin.'&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        copyright for &quot;Khosara, Khosara&quot; is split between Hamdy, his 
        uncle and his three siblings. In the mid-2000s, Fahmy authorized a third 
        party, Ahab Nafal Joseph, to file claims on behalf of the Hamdy relatives. 
        But the claims were thrown out of court because Nafal was a nonexclusive 
        licensee. Fahmy's suit followed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Fahmy 
        also sought to recover the rapper's profits from concert performances 
        of the chart-topper, released in April 2000. Last year Snyder issued another 
        order, agreeing that Jay-Z's defense of laches barred Fahmy's claims for 
        damages from March 30, 2011 to the present.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
        the Supreme Court ruling in Petrella, Fahmy filed a motion for reconsideration.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Snyder 
        granted that motion in the July 21 order and vacated the claims barred 
        by laches.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Petrella 
        holds that laches is not a bar to the adjudication of claims for damages 
        brought within the Copyright Act's three-year statute of limitations,&quot; 
        Snyder wrote in the 10-page order. &quot;This holding represents a substantial 
        change in the law governing laches in the Ninth Circuit, which, prior 
        to the Supreme Court's ruling, was 'the most hostile to copyright owners 
        of all the circuits' in its application of laches.'&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Snyder 
        noted that while the Supreme Court did &quot;not banish laches from copyright 
        law altogether,&quot; Jay-Z did not present &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; 
        that would defeat Fahmy's motion for reconsideration.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Defendants respond that extraordinary circumstances exist in the 
        present case because, as a result of plaintiff's delay in bringing suit, 
        defendants have suffered evidentiary prejudice from the death of a key 
        witness, Magdi Amorousi, and have suffered expectations-based prejudice 
        because they made substantial investments in the exploitation of 'Big 
        Pimpin'' in reliance on the assumption that there were no 'unasserted 
        claims' of copyright infringement,&quot; Snyder wrote.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">(As 
        principal of Egyptian music recording company, Amorousi had allegedly 
        transferred rights to &quot;Khosara Khosara&quot; to EMI).<br>
        But the judge said that though the defendants may have &quot;suffered 
        prejudice as a result of plaintiff's delay, this prejudice does not rise 
        to the level of the 'extraordinary circumstances.'&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Accordingly, 
        the court concludes that it is not appropriate to curtail plaintiff's 
        entitlement to equitable relief at this stage,&quot; Snyder wrote.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        judge rejected Jay-Z's argument to divide the trial into one part for 
        liability and damages, and another for equitable remedies.<br>

        &#147;A stronger release schedule, combined with sustained investment 
        in exceptional artistic talent and first-class execution by our operators, 
        delivered robust results this quarter,&#148; said Stephen Cooper, Warner 
        Music Group&#146;s CEO. &#147;We are especially pleased to see our strategic 
        moves pay off, with the acquisition of Parlophone Label Group (PLG) being 
        a key contributor to this quarter&#146;s success. We expect our momentum 
        to continue through the remainder of the fiscal year, due to several exciting 
        artist releases in the coming months.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;We are pleased with our financial performance with key highlights 
        including solid revenue growth, improvement in Adjusted OIBDA and an increase 
        in our cash balance as compared to the prior-year quarter,&#148; added 
        Brian Roberts, Warner Music Group&#146;s Executive Vice President and 
        CFO. &#147;Excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the PLG acquisition

        West, a whimsical addition to the cryptocurrency craze, whose founders 
        hitched its name and logo to the wagon of one of the biggest stars in 
        hip-hop, has officially died. In documents filed July 22 in New York, 
        a U.S. District Court declared Kanye West the victor over most of Coinye's 
        makers, some of them John-and-Jane Does, by default because they never 
        bothered to respond to his complaints.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        parody electronic currency was announced in January but quickly shut down 
        after West filed a cease-and-desist order and sued the large group of 
        defendants for unspecified damages. The lawsuit complained that the defendants 
        &quot;usurped West's name and likeness for the sole purpose of propping 
        up the perceived 'value' of the defendants' 'digital coin mine' and its 
        'crypto currency.'&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        coin's first logo was of West's face wearing his trademark windowshade 
        sunglasses. Following the lawsuit, the logo was altered to make West a 
        cartoon fish (ala &quot;South Park&quot;). The Coinye site, coinyecoin.org, 
        still invites people to &quot;Start using CoinyeCoin today.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        March, two months after Coinye was abandoned, a frustrated West amended 
        his lawsuit to include names, background and even emails of some of the 
        defendants, who &quot;cowardly sought to remain anonymous by using Registry 
        privacy services and other means&quot; to stay hidden,&quot; he alleged. 
        The suit claimed defendants came from a wide range of places, including 
        the United States, China, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Slovakia.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        the end, only three of the defendants, Richard McCord, David McEnery and 
        Harry Willis, settled with West. In court papers, McCord, of California, 
        denied being involved in the coin's creation. According to a report by 
        coindesk.com, McCord's lawyer called it &quot;unfortunate that a parody 
        turned into such an expensive endeavor.&quot; <font size="1">Source: Billboard</font></font></p>

        IS IGGY AZALEA THE NEXT BIG THING?<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Australian rapper, Iggy Azalea, joined the legendary Beatles in the US 
        chart records, when her hit &quot;Fancy&quot; topped the Billboard Hot 
        100, followed by &quot;Problem&quot;, Iggy's collaboration with Ariana 
        Grande, in second place. Since the Fab Four from Liverpool lead the charts 
        with &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; 
        in 1964, no artist has managed to get two hits on top of the Billboard 
        charts at the same time -- until now. And it does not look like she is 
        willing to give up her place on top either -- Iggy has been occupying 
        the top ranks seven weeks in a row already. Apparently proud of her achievement, 
        she tweeted &quot;Let this serve as proof anything is possible,&quot; 
        when she learned about the great news.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        2007, the then 16-year old Amethyst Amelia Kelly relocated from Down Under 
        and came to Miami, Florida, determined to pursue a music career in the 
        United States. She adopted her stage name, a combination of her childhood 
        dog, Iggy, and the street she lived on as a child, Azalea Street, and 
        sallied out to make connections in the music world. Iggy moved from Miami 
        to Houston to Atlanta, before she ended up in Los Angeles, where she met 
        T.I. and released two mixtapes that were widely recognized in the hip-hop 
        scene. When her initial success sizzled out in 2012, T.I. introduced Iggy 
        to his booking agent, Cara Lewis, who saw great potential in the blonde 
        Aussie girl and agreed to help her. Now, almost two years later, Iggy 
        Azalea is on top of the charts with debut studio album, &quot;The New 
        Classic&quot;, which was released in April.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Cara 
        Lewis knows talent when she sees, or more accurately, hears it. Named 
        one of the most powerful women in music by Billboard for four consecutive 
        years, she has helped many musical talents to fame over the course of 
        her career. After 23 years of experience as the hip-hop agent representing 
        stars such as Eminem, 50 Cent, Kanye West, Common, B.o.B. and the Roots, 
        she joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2012, much to the delight 
        of Rob Light, CAA's head of music and managing partner: &quot;Cara has 
        built a remarkable career cultivating the careers of some of the most 
        acclaimed artists in music today. Her expertise of the urban market, ability 
        to innovate, and keen eye for talent will be great assets to our continued 
        growth.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Anchored 
        by humble beginnings as a receptionist, agent Cara Lewis has made herself 
        an industry legend. Thanks to the help of a longtime friend, Russell Simmons, 
        combined with her unparalleled instincts and work ethic, Cara was one 
        of the first agents to recognize the crossover potential of urban music, 
        and played an integral role in turning an underground movement into a 
        mainstream business. She has opened doors for many up-and-coming hip-hop 
        artists and R&amp;B singers by exposing them to a mainstream audience, 
        allowing them to venture into other business opportunities such as clothing 
        lines, sports drinks as well as film and television roles. Lewis has represented 
        a long list of legendary acts throughout her career, including The Beastie 
        Boys, New Edition, Run DMC, Pharrell Williams, Outkast, the Black Eyed 
        Peas, and Rihanna, to just name a few. Lewis has been named one of the 
        &quot;20 Most Influential People in Black Music&quot; by Essence Magazine, 
        and is listed in the &quot;20 Music Industry Innovators&quot; by The Hollywood

        New Mexico resident announces his official signing to DMX&#146;s Ruff 
        Ryders/Bloodline label.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Word 
        One tells the story of how he met DMX through friends and legendary hip-hop 
        collective, Bone Thugs N Harmony. &#147;It started with my friends Bone 
        Thugs N Harmony plugging me in. I was kicking it on the tour bus with 
        them after a show they invited me to in El Paso, TX and Flesh &amp; Krayzie 
        plugged me in with the tour manager and told me about the next tour being 
        DMX. They recommended me to the tour manager, and 6 days later, I was 
        on tour, opening for DMX.&#148; It was soon after that Word One met Montana, 
        DMX&#146;s manager and director of Ruff Ryders, in Houston, TX.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;When 
        we got to the next city (which was San Antonio), DMX had me come into 
        his green room and spit 16 bars. After I spit the verse, he expressed 
        how he liked my style and how real my words were. That&#146;s when I caught 
        his attention. We then had Denny&#146;s that night with his wife, manager 
        and security and got to know each other on a more personal level.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Word 
        One spent much of the early part of the tour spitting verses for DMX, 
        showing the legendary rapper that he too had what it takes to share a 
        stage. Word One, who was already in a label situation with a Sony Records 
        subsidiary expressed to DMX&#146;s manager Montana that he wanted to be 
        signed to a label that acted as a family &amp; had his best interests 
        at heart. Montana, who was very impressed by Word One&#146;s ability to 
        control the crowd and work the stage, proposed that he manage Word One 
        as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Following 
        the tour, Word One met up with DMX once again for Houston&#146;s Summer 
        Fest concert series where he told an excited DMX the news of them sharing 
        management. &#147;DMX was excited to hear that news, saying &#147;YESSSSSSS&#148; 
        when I told him. We talked about how things were going much better for 
        me since the tour and that&#146;s when X said to me that he &#145;wants 
        to be a part of it&#146; and proposed to me the type of deal I would have 
        with him. I thought it was awesome.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It

        at the conclusion of this year's event. Both Landrieu and Ebanks said 
        they're committed to locking the festival into a new deal, but several 
        pieces to the puzzle remained in flux.</font></p>

        know the outcome.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Landrieu 
        recalled that before the festival launched 20 years ago, the city was 
        dead in terms of visitors over the July 4th holiday. He said hotel bookings 
        were at about 3 percent compared to today when occupancy over that same 
        weekend is now consistently at about 97 percent each year.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Twenty

        rapper&#146;s yearslong battle with neighbors over his annual Fourth of

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Flavor 
        Flav (real name, William Drayton Jr.), has been setting off thousands 
        of dollars worth of illegal fireworks since 2009 and this wasn&#146;t 
        his first clash with police over the party in his gated community outside 
        his home. The home is in the 7800 block of Via Ventura Court on the south 
        side of the Las Vegas Valley.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">His 
        festivities were foiled last year when TMZ reported he planned to set 
        off $8,000 worth of fireworks. After the story broke, the Metropolitan 
        Police Department threatened to throw the rapper in jail if he set off 
        any of the illegal fireworks and Drayton moved the party elsewhere, said 
        Finisterre Homeowners Association board member Harold Ewing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
        year, neighbors, who asked not to be named, said the rapper had three 
        or four pallets of fireworks stacked 4 feet high. Drayton said he set 
        off most of them all at once in hopes that police wouldn&#146;t become 
        involved. In previous years, neighbors said he set off the fireworks in 
        batches, using a police scanner to avoid run-ins with the law.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Police 
        put a stop to this year&#146;s show after neighbors called. Officers responded 
        just before 8 p.m. Police confiscated more than 100 pounds of Drayton&#146;s 
        remaining fireworks and gave him two fireworks-related citations, said 
        Lt. Ken Romaine. He was unable to name the exact citations the rapper 
        received.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        number of explosives required that Metro send a special unit to dispose 
        of the fireworks, he said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ewing 
        said police followed up with neighbors on Saturday, suggesting that they 
        petition the district attorney&#146;s office to see if it will do something 
        about the rapper&#146;s behavior.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Police 
        have written four fireworks citations in the valley over the past two 
        years, according to officer Larry Hadfield.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ewing 
        said the police have more or less said, &#147;Eh&#133;it&#146;s going 
        to happen.&#148; Neighbors said officers told them to consider how many 
        other fireworks calls Metro must deal with throughout the valley.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Several 
        of Drayton&#146;s neighbors are terrified to leave their homes on the 
        holiday, fearing their property will catch fire, Ewing said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ewing 
        said he plans to contact the DA&#146;s office to see what can be done.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But 
        Drayton said his neighbors won&#146;t have to worry about his fireworks 
        show next year. The rapper is moving his party out of the neighborhood.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;I 
        don&#146;t want to go to jail for fireworks,&#148; he said, lamenting 
        the loss of his tradition and noting that several people told him this 
        year was the best Fourth of July of their life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Drayton 
        estimated he had about 110 people over, a smaller crowd than previous 
        years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;We 
        all had a ball until the police came,&#148; Drayton said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        party was so good that evidence of it still remained, he said, pointing 
        to the empty beer cans outside his home and fireworks gunpowder residue 
        on the street.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some

        a rare announcement for hip-hop heads everywhere, all eight members of 
        The Hieroglyphics Imperium crew will be heading out to perform at special 
        venues on the East Coast this coming August, along with longtime Hiero 
        affiliate DJ Toure. With four select dates on the East Coast, including 
        stops inBoston, New York, Philadelphia, and Stephentown, New York, this 
        tour proves to be a unique, rare opportunity for fans to see the entire 
        original crew performing together. As part of an already eventful year, 
        the upcoming Hiero tour will be another major highlight for the collective.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2014 
        has been quite the year for the Hieroglyphics members, who have released 
        several new projects including Souls of Mischief member A-Plus' Molly's 
        Dirty Water, Phesto's Infared Rum, and Casual's new group project, The 
        School System. Upcoming releases from Pep Love along with Adrian Younge 
        and Souls of Mischief have kept the collective busy and working hard. 
        In addition to this upcoming tour, the Hieroglyphics will begin work on 
        the new crew album. After the tour ends, fans in Heiro's hometown of Oakland 
        will be met with the group's return home, just in time for their free 
        annual block party, Hiero Day, which was recognized an an official day 
        by the mayor of Oakland at last year's event.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Hieroglyphics crew, known as pioneers of independent hip-hop, is made 
        up of members Del The Funky Homosapien, Casual, Pep Love, Domino, and 
        Souls of Mischief, who include A-Plus, Opio, Phesto, Tajaj. Not only are 
        they considered to be one of the first hip-hop artist collectives to start 
        their own record label, but they introduced a different side of hip hop 
        that was virtually unknown on a mainstream level. When Elektra Records 
        signed Del the Funky Homosapien and JIVE signed Souls of Mischief in the 
        early '90s, the Hiero crew soon became internationally known as the leaders 
        of a new movement in rap that represented peace and unity, despite having 
        come from a city rife with violent crime. Considered to be some of the 
        most highly skilled lyricists in rap from their inception to today, the 
        Hiero crew continued to break hip-hop norms with personal, emotional rhymes 
        rather than solely gangster-rap. Souls Of Mischief's &quot;93 'Till Infinity&quot; 
        remains one of the most respected and well-known hip-hop classics, referred 
        to in pop culture time and time again. The third eye logo, designed by 
        Del, was ranked as the 3rd most recognizeable music logo by Rolling Stone 
        Magazine, and it is not uncommon for fans to show Hiero members their 
        third eye logo tattoos.</font></p>

        Autism is a serious problem. Not everybody knows that every 1 child from 
        88 children suffers from this disease. Life of these kids often means 
        sad isolation from normal society. Diagnosis at early stages and good 
        therapy including proper diet helps to cure this disease and make life 
        easier and improve it. Many famous people including Mozart, Albert Einstein, 
        Isaac Newton or Marilyn Monroe had autism at some stage of their life. 
        Today if we talk about autism we think of such great people as Bill Gates, 
        Keanu Reeves, Robbie Williams or one of the best football players Leo 
        Messi from Barcelona club.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;It`s 
        very important that we all help the kids. Our help can really change their 
        life. If someone buys the CD all of the profits will go to the New Hope 
        Foundation to help children with autism. If you can`t afford the CD you 
        can also share this recording on your facebook or twitter profile. You 
        can watch commercials on youtube to gain money for the children. I would 
        also like to ask the media to show big heart for children with autism 
        by promoting the song, especially the radio stations and tv channels.

        LILES TALKS D'ANGELO.<br>

        caught up with Kevin Liles and got the scoop on What's going on with D'Angelo. 
        </font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So 
        what's going on with D'Angelo?<br>
        Here's the thing: with D'Angelo was a process. He didn't perform for 10 
        years and he's been working on an album for the past 12 years. I actually 
        got him to go out and do 30 shows [in 2011-2012], and then we did some 
        &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; shows [with ?uestlove last year]. I said, 
        &quot;We have to get motivated around what people want to hear from you, 
        and what does it mean to come back to that space?&quot; He very bluntly 
        put it, &quot;Kev, the studio and the stage: that's my lifeblood. Now 
        that I've touched it again, now that I see it again, I wanna be sure that 
        the baby I'm about to have &#151; the album &#151; that I take it to the 
        point where it's all it can be.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        There'll be an album this year: there's 14 records so far, we might have 
        a couple of bonus records, but all the recording is basically done we're 
        mixing and mastering now. Definitely, he'll be back. We'll probably start 
        an international tour in October, we'll come back [to the States]. We're 
        doing a James Brown tribute in August [at the Hollywood Bowl] and some 
        one-off things. But the touring will probably start in October and 2015.<br>
        <br>
        What's the album like?<br>
        To limit it to soul is not the case, because there is a rock influence. 
        But at the same time, it's very melodic and there's an influence of all 
        the things he loves: there's James Brown, there's Prince, and everything 
        people grew up loving D'Angelo for, from &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; to &quot;Voodoo.&quot; 
        It's a mixture and an evolution of where he is right now. And you have 
        to think that when you have the opportunity to work 10 years on an album, 
        that album's truly gonna be what you want it to be. Is it limited to the 
        kind of sound that he did with the earlier records? No, it's not.<br>
        <br>
        Does it have a name yet?<br>
        There is a potential name, but I don't wanna give you a potential name 
        and then change it.<br>
        <br>
        And it's definitely coming in 2014?<br>
        Yep. Sooner than later!</font></p>

        shooting involving rapper ScHoolboy Q after a concert at the historic

        is not just a coincidence. We think there is probably more to it than 
        that,&quot; said Jacki Kelley, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County 
        Sheriff's Office. &quot;It does seem to be more targeted than random.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        rapper was not hurt in Thursday night's shooting, but three other people 
        in the vehicle he was in sustained non-life threatening injuries. One 
        of the victims was released from the hospital Friday morning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">No 
        arrests have been made, but Kelley said investigators have received numerous 
        tips and are trying to determine a motive for the attack in a parking 
        lot at the outdoor venue, where the Beatles and Grateful Dead have performed 
        and U2 filmed &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">ScHoolboy 
        Q, whose birth name is Quincy Matthew Hanley, is from Los Angeles. His 
        most recent album, &quot;Oxymoron,&quot; debuted at No. 1 earlier this 
        year and reflects his life as a father and former gang member.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
        and Kendrick Lamar, who was nominated for seven Grammys this year, are

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        March, when ScHoolboy Q played at a sold-out show in Denver, someone in 
        the crowd threw an object at the performer, who jumped off the stage to 
        confront the person, The Denver Post reported. Security staff separated 
        them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ray 
        Alba, a representative for ScHoolboy Q, didn't immediately return a phone 
        call seeking comment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        rapper and at least four other people were in the white SUV that was fired 
        on at the venue in the foothills west of Denver, authorities said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">They 
        drove themselves to a Denver intersection about 15 miles away, apparently 
        in search of a hospital, before being stopped by Denver police and taken 
        for medical attention, Kelley said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">ScHoolboy 
        Q and another uninjured person were briefly handcuffed while police assessed 
        the situation, but no one in the vehicle was arrested. Kelley said ScHoolboy 
        Q was not a suspect in the shooting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Nas 
        and Flying Lotus also performed at the concert that benefited three groups, 
        including the Gang Rescue and Support Project of Denver. Kelley said she

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Promoters 
        said the gang rescue group received 5 percent of the profits. Two other

        COOL KIDS' SIR MICHAEL ROCKS ON DECK.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Born 
        Antoine Reed, Sir Michael Rocks has always been a a little ahead of his 
        time, a little more original than his peers, a little bit more creative. 
        Since he and fellow The Cool Kids member Chuck Inglish burst onto the 
        scene in 2007 as teenagers, they've helped redefine the image of underground, 
        independent rap for the Internet era with their effortlessly cool aesthetic 
        and catchy, creative, music. Having grown older and wiser over the years, 
        the ever-evolving and defining style icon Sir Michael Rocks has recently 
        traded in his hallmark throwback, flashy aesthetic to embrace a more simple, 
        back-to-the-land aesthetic, selling off his old diamond-studded jewelry 
        in favor of handmade wooden pieces that offer significant and power. As 
        he explores an increasingly far-ranging set of ideas, his lifelong impulse 
        to explore and innovate remains at the forefront of what Rocks is trying 
        to accomplish and is very much present in his upcoming debut solo album, 
        Banco, which is slated for release on July 29th and pre-order starting 
        July 1st, 2014.<br>
        <br>
        With features from Too $hort, Mac Miller, Twista, Iamsu, Trinidad James, 
        Casey Veggies, Robb Bank$, Pouya and Chuck Inglish and production from 
        DJ Mustard, Banco showcases Sir Michael at his most inventive and most 
        personal. Whether he's bragging about his juicer or sharing a tragic story 
        involving a family member's fatal car accident, Sir Michael Rocks keeps 
        the vibe positive and honest,<br>
        upholding the notion that nothing can be made without giving something 
        up, and that people can make anything they want if they're willing to 
        do so. A lifelong love of video games and anime has nurtured other values 
        as well: hard work, respect for others, and, above all, a refusal to let 
        his surroundings temper his innate sense of joy. Being surrounded by nature 
        and animals is another thing that brings the former Chicago native joy, 
        and now that he lives in wildlife-teeming South Florida in Miami, he's 
        incorporated those themes more than ever into his music and Photoshop-driven 
        collage cover art, which he created himself. Banco is a fascinating left 
        turn of an album that finds Rocks making the most experimental, energetic, 
        and varied music of his career.<br>
        <br>
        Sir Michael Rocks also announced via Twitter that The Cool Kids will be 
        ending their hiatus and reuniting to release their highly anticipated 
        album Shark Week by the end of the year. This will mark the first album 
        The Cool Kids will have released since their 2011 album When Fish Ride 
        Bicycles. Sir Michael Rocks is also prepping for a multi-city Florida 
        tour alongside Robb Bank$.</font></font></font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2"><br>

        Records have announced the promotion of Wendy Goldstein from Senior Vice 
        President of A&amp;R to Executive Vice President and Head of Urban A&amp;R. 
        This announcement officially comes from the label's Executive Vice President, 
        Rob Stevenson and founders and chief executives Monte and Avery Lipman.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
        Senior Vice President of A&amp;R since 2011, Goldstein has focused on 
        cultivating and bolstering the label&#146;s presence within the urban 
        realm. In 2013, she collaborated with Ariana Grande on the conception 
        and release of her full-length debut, Yours Truly, which debuted #1 on 
        the Billboard Top 200 upon release and yielded the #1 double-platinum 
        smash, &#147;The Way&#148;[featuring Mac Miller]. Capitalizing on this 
        success, Goldstein helped Grande catapult to the next level once again 
        with 2014&#146;s &#147;Problem&#148; [featuring Iggy Azalea]. Upon release, 
        it was the biggest single debut of the year so far and the fourth highest 
        for a female in history with over 435,000-plus digital downloads sold. 
        Moreover, it became the eight highest digital song debut of all-time.<br>
        <br>
        Under Goldstein&#146;s tenure, Republic Records signed Bay Area hip-hop 
        sensation Sage The Gemini, soul crooner Adrian Marcel, and super producer 
        DJ Mustard via a venture with Roc Nation. In addition, she handled A&amp;R 
        duties for Enrique Iglesias, Mika, Colbie Caillat, and more. Her diligence, 
        work ethic, and prescient perspective contributed to establishing the 
        label as a powerful force in the urban marketplace.<br>
        Monte Lipman states, &quot;Wendy has worked with many of today&#146;s 
        most popular artists and is widely respected throughout the industry. 
        She has overseen the production of many significant albums that have made 
        a tremendous impact on pop culture. Her contribution to Republic remains 
        invaluable.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Avery 
        Lipman continues, &#147;Wendy&#146;s been a part of this family since 
        the beginning. We have a tremendous professional history together. Her 
        knack for helping artists realize their true potential is genuinely one 
        of a kind. It&#146;s an honor to build upon our legacy as a team.&#148;<br>
        Stevenson adds, &#147;Wendy has a keen sense for finding talent and is 
        dedicated to her artists. She will be an integral to the label&#146;s 
        expansion within the world of hip-hop and R&amp;B, and we&#146;re excited 
        to see who she discovers next!&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Goldstein 
        comments, &quot;I want to continue building the urban presence of Republic 
        Records. Monte, Avery, and Rob are the greatest. They encourage everyone 
        around them to thrive. We all share the same mindset. We have a common 
        goal to finish number one. It&#146;s one of the best environments I&#146;ve 
        worked in. We all love music, and we want to build a legacy for the Republic 
        brand.&#148;<br>

        it has shaped my life. We made history together in so many ways and I 
        will cherish those memories and my friendships forever. This was one of

        to move on, to grow and to be challenged in new ways. Saying goodbye is 
        always emotional and bitter sweet but I am extremely excited about the

        unimaginable journey. Today will be my last show -- stay tuned.... Love,

        OF MISCHIEF ANNOUNCE 6TH ALBUM.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Legendary 
        hip-hop group Souls of Mischief announce that they're releasing a conceptual 
        collaboration with renowned producer and multi-instrumentalist Adrian 
        Younge entitled There Is Only Now on Adrian's newly launched record label, 
        Linear Labs on August 26th, 2014. Inspired by a near-fatal incident involving 
        group members A-Plus, Opio, Tajai, and Phesto early in their careers, 
        the unique and cinematic crime tale creatively and expertly weaves stories 
        of love, loss, and revenge throughout the entire album. Set in 1994, There 
        is Only Now serves as a bookend to two decades of music since the release 
        of their seminal debut album, '93 Til Infinity.<br>
        <br>
        There Is Only Now sees the Souls of Mischief crew members trading bars 
        with a cast of hip-hop and soul luminaries. Narrated by A Tribe Called 
        Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammed - as DJ for fictional local Oakland 
        radio station K-NOW - the album's story unfolds under his all-seeing eye. 
        Busta Rhymes makes an appearance as the story's villain, Womack, on &quot;Womack's 
        Lament,&quot; while William Hart of the legendary vocal soul group, The 
        Delfonics, lends his buttery falsetto to the contemplative &quot;Another 
        Side of You.&quot; Snoop Dogg drops knowledge on the situation between 
        Stoney and Womack with an ice cold verse on the title track &quot;There 
        Is Only Now,&quot; and Scarub from Living Legends goes in on &quot;Stone 
        Cold.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        Souls of Mischief and Adrian Younge have created a hip-hop album like 
        no other. Recorded solely on 2&quot; analogue tape, using only acoustic 
        live instrumentation played mostly by Adrian himself, and recorded together 
        as a group in one room, the project boasts incredible dedication, discipline, 
        and skill sets that few others in modern day can match. Adrian employed 
        no computers, no drum sampling, and everything was recorded in one take. 
        The result of a special moment for all involved, There Is Only Now proves 
        that after two decades in the rap game hip-hop's Fab Four remains committed 
        to the expansion of their legacy as hip-hop innovators and pioneers.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Starting 
        with their landmark debut '93 'til Infinity, Oakland's four-person rap 
        group Souls of Mischief has blazed the trail for hip hop's evolution. 
        Members Tajai, A-Plus, Phesto, and Opio have left their mark sonically, 
        lyrically, and stylistically on Kanye West, Just Blaze, Big Sean, Big 
        K.R.I.T., P. Diddy, Vampire Weekend, John Mayer, and many more who have 
        cited them as cultural icons and influencers. Souls is also credited as 
        having pioneered the independent label movement when they started Hieroglyphic 
        Imperium Records in 1997 following their departure with JIVE Records, 
        creating the infrastructure blueprint for other succesful independent 
        hip hop labels. Co-founders of the Hiero label also include emcees Del 
        Tha Funky Homosapien, Casual, Pep Love, and producer Domino. Souls' also 
        forged hip-hop's relationship with the skate, surf, and snowboard communities 
        after iconic skate brands included their music in their VHS videotapes 
        in the mid-90's. The group's creative output and legacy as a whole continues 
        to thrive, and they show no sign of stopping. In 2013, Souls celebrated 
        the 20 year anniversary of '93 til Infinity, prepped a documentary film, 
        embarked on a 50-city &quot;Still Infinity Tour,&quot; and released a 
        joint 20th anniversary limited edition tee shirt capsule collection with 
        Ecko Unlimited. They are now prepping for the August 26th release of their 
        sixth studio album, There Is Only Now, a cinematic collaborative effort 
        with renowned producer Adrian Younge on Adrian's newly launched Linear 
        Labs record label.</font></p>

        BIOPIC FINALLY GETS GREEN LIGHT.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
        more than five years, four writers and a tough-to-please trio that holds 
        cast and script veto power, Universal's N.W.A biopic &quot;Straight Outta 
        Compton&quot; is finally getting the green light.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sources say the studio 
        has assembled its leading threesome to tackle the roles of Ice Cube, Dr. 
        Dre and the late Eazy-E. The three parties with approval - Cube, Dre and 
        Eazy-E's widow Tomica Wright - have signed off on the actors who will 
        play the core members of the seminal rap group.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's no secret that 
        Cube has been lobbying for his son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., 24, to be cast 
        as the teen version of his father, and it appears he got his wish.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Less known is the 
        classically trained actor who is said to have won the role of Dre, Marcus 
        Callender. Although the alum of New York's Shakespeare Lab at the Public 
        Theater might be more familiar with Chekhov than Compton's gang-plagued 
        streets, he beat out a phalanx of would-be rappers (the Beats co-founder 
        originally wanted Michael B. Jordan to play him, but the actor is about 
        to take on a Fantastic Four reboot at Fox). Still, Callender has some 
        screen credits, including the pilot for Steve Zaillian's Criminal Justice 
        on HBO, as well as bit parts in the CBS series Blue Bloods and Elementary.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even more obscure 
        is Jason Mitchell, who insiders say landed the role of Eazy-E after an 
        out-of-the-park screen test. If his casting sticks, it will make for a 
        great backstory, given that he is said to have no acting background and 
        works in a kitchen. (Ironically, IMDB.com already lists two actors that 
        are not correct: Donat Sean Abiff as Dre and Brian Gilbert as Cube.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The casting of the 
        film has been followed breathlessly for some time, ever since the studio 
        first announced plans to bring the gangsta rap pioneers to the big screen. 
        Despite scripts by Alan Wenkus, S. Leigh Savidge and Andrea Berloff, the 
        project languished for years. But in 2012, F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) 
        became attached to the project, reviving its prospects. And in late 2013, 
        Jonathan Herman did a major script overhaul, which got the studio excited. 
        Then, in the spring, Universal shot a sequence in Los Angeles in order 
        to qualify for California's film tax credit, which is set to expire. With 
        the film technically underway, Universal had to find its cast. Sources 
        say Wright was the final holdout, but she has finally given her stamp 
        of approval, paving the way for principal photography to begin in less 
        than two months. <font size="1">Source: Billboard</font></font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

        <font color="#FFCC66"><b>KANYE RETURNS TO BONNAROO.</b></font><br>
        With new wife Kim Kardashian looking on along with 80,000 fans, Kanye 
        West showed up pretty much on time at the Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">West seemed to be 
        in a good mood Friday night at the annual festival just three weeks after 
        his marriage to Kardashian in Florence, Italy. The 37-year-old rapper 
        made no mention of his new wife, but Kardashian was on hand for the show. 
        She watched from the soundboard, about 50 yards from her husband on the 
        main stage, in stylish &#151; but muddy Bonnaroo-unfriendly &#151; high 
        heels and white pants. She sang along and occasionally waved her hands 
        in the air with the crowd.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The show comes six 
        years after West famously began his first Bonnaroo appearance at 4:30 
        a.m. following technical delays with his set. West mentioned that appearance, 
        again skewering Pearl Jam for delaying his start and the media he says 
        inaccurately portrayed the reasons for his late start.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At one point, West 
        stopped his set and repeatedly shouted: &quot;Where the press at? Where 
        the press at?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were many reporters 
        on hand to catch the performance, marking what time he'd show up. West 
        appeared 10 minutes after his listed start time and played a mix of hits 
        and cuts from his 2013 album &quot;Yeezus,&quot; which offered the most 
        visually arresting moments of the night. He wrapped his set with the powerful 
        &quot;Blood on the Leaves&quot; after about 90 minutes, 20 minutes before 
        his scheduled finish.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The show, played under 
        a full moon, included elements from West's recent arena tour, including 
        one of the masks he wore. But he ditched the snow-capped mountain and 
        white Jesus in favor of a 30-foot-tall LED screen. West performed mostly 
        in silhouette, relying on the big screen to relay his distorted image 
        to much of the crowd. Though most sang along with West, many fans could 
        not see the artist perform.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the elements 
        in the show will be familiar to fans who've seen him recently. He gave 
        a pep talk at one point, encouraging creative people to pursue their dreams. 
        And he compared himself to John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison, 
        calling himself the biggest rock star in the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And he returned to 
        a favorite speech about how he no longer needs hit songs or radio airplay 
        because he's not competing with other living artists. He's looking to 
        install himself as a timeless cultural icon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I ain't going 
        after nobody on the radio,&quot; West said. &quot;I'm going after Shakespeare. 
        I'm going after Walt Disney. I'm going after Howard Hughes. I'm going 
        after Genghis Khan. I'm going after Henry Ford ...&quot;</font><br>

        BIRDMAN ENTERS PARTNERSHIP WITH MALOOF VENTURES.<br>
        </font></font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="3"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Cash 
        Money Records co-founder Bryan Williams aka Birdman has initiated a partnership 
        with Maloof Ventures in regards to Never Hungover. The groundbreaking 
        hangover prevention supplement is available across the country. Given 
        its early success, availability will expand exponentially within the coming 
        months.</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Over 
        the past two decades, Birdman has forged a longstanding professional and 
        personal relationship with the Maloof family. Given that bond, Maloof 
        Ventures presented Never Hungover to the visionary entrepreneur and Cash 
        Money Records co-leader, and he immediately saw potential in the brand, 
        initiating this collaboration. Together, these two entities strive to 
        lift the brand up as a household name and the &#147;leader in hangover 
        prevention.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">About 
        the partnership, Birdman comments, &#147;It was only a matter of time 
        before I would get to do something with the Maloof family. As soon as 
        they showed me Never Hungover, I realized its immense promise, and I wanted 
        to be a part of the brand. We all share the same enthusiasm and excitement. 
        Through this partnership, we&#146;re going to make a big impact on the 
        marketplace.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#147;I've 
        known Birdman for several years and found him to be an engaging personality 
        and brilliant business mind. His building of Cash Money Records to prominence 
        is an amazing American success story. The combination of Maloof Ventures 
        with Birdman and his team is going to take Never Hungover to even greater 
        heights,&#148; shares Gavin Maloof.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Steven 
        Ferraro of Maloof Ventures says, &#147;By coming together, we provide 
        a lot of power. It&#146;s an effective direct-to-market approach resulting 
        from this formidable alliance. Together, we&#146;re aspiring to make Never 
        Hungover part of people&#146;s lifestyle, maximize visibility, and accelerate 
        rapid growth for the brand.&#148;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That 
        growth is due to the brand&#146;s validity. Already, it has been featured 
        on the television show Doctors. Expect more news about this partnership 
        soon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Never 
        Hungover founder &amp; C.E.O. Parrish Whitaker discovered this &#147;drink, 
        before you drink&#148; serendipitously. When his sister was undergoing 
        treatment for Lupus, he realized that the supplement that aided in her 
        recovery could also be used to help prevent hangovers. After experimenting 
        with different uses of this proprietary formula, Whitaker discovered that 
        the mix of ingredients also helped minimize the effects caused by hangover 
        symptoms when consumed before or while drinking. He immediately trademarked 
        the name and began working on launching the product. Phil Maloof sampled 
        Never Hungover at a spirit trade convention, and he realized that it actually 
        worked. At that point, Maloof Ventures acquired Never Hungover and put 
        it into official production, refining a satisfying lime-aid flavor, creating 
        a clean, engaging bottle design and packaging, and officially bringing 
        it to market in January 2014 at GNC stores nationwide.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Never 
        Hungover is a great tasting dietary supplement that is comprised of a 
        natural vitamin blend, antioxidants, amino acids, nutrients, and minerals. 
        It is packaged as a 2oz serving in a bottle that can be consumed as a 
        shot or mixer, as well as a 750ML bottle for on premise locations. It 
        is designed to take up to an hour before or while consuming alcohol and 
        experiences optimal results when taking one bottle per four drinks. It 
        is caffeine and gluten-free. It contains zero carbs, calories, and no 
        sugar.</font><br>

        FOR THE DAY.</b></font><br>
        On Thursday, June 12 from 9 until 11 a.m., recording artist and Detroit 
        native, Big Sean will return to his hometown to act as &quot;Principal 
        for the Day&quot; at Bates Academy (Bates), an Excellent Schools Detroit 
        &quot;Top K-8 Recommended School.&quot; Competing against thousands of 
        students from 37 Detroit Public Schools' (DPS) middle and high schools, 
        Bates won the Get Schooled Detroit Attendance Challenge this spring. More 
        than half of all participating schools posted attendance increases during 
        the challenge. Joining the Bates students will be eighth graders from 
        Durfee Elementary-Middle School (Durfee), who saw their attendance jump 
        a district high of 11 percent through their participation in the Challenge. 
        Shade 45 radio host Sway will serve as host and emcee of the day's events 
        along with local radio personality, DJ Fingers, of FM 98 WJLB.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        an effort to combat chronic absenteeism across the district, DPS partnered 
        with Get Schooled and its founding partner, Viacom, through the company's 
        Viacommunity social responsibility umbrella, to offer the Detroit Attendance 
        Challenge in support of the district's &quot;On Time. All Day. Every Day.&quot; 
        Campaign. The Attendance Campaign falls under the district's five-year 
        Strategic Plan to initiate new methods to better serve the needs of students 
        and families. The district implemented a new Attendance Policy in the 
        fall of 2013 to provide a standardized and consistent district-wide policy 
        for better enforcement and increase accountability among students, parents, 
        staff and support agencies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;The 
        correlation between success in life and daily attendance in school is 
        inarguable,&quot; said Big Sean. &quot;As a former DPS student, I could 
        not be more proud of the district for taking the issue of attendance seriously, 
        and of Bates Academy for its awesome achievement. I'm excited to have 
        the chance to celebrate the students' commitment to showing up for school, 
        all day, every day.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
        recognition of the role youth leadership played in affecting change on 
        school campuses during the Challenge, Get Schooled and Viacom have founded 
        the Get Schooled Student Leadership Corps in partnership with Detroit-based 
        nonprofit, the Coleman A. Young Foundation (CAYF). At the recommendation 
        of The Skillman Foundation, Get Schooled tapped the longstanding CAYF 
        to serve as the implementation partner for the new initiative. As principal 
        for the day, Big Sean will help launch the Corps' inaugural class of 30 
        students from across DPS. He will join Sway, Mike Grams, metro Detroit 
        native and Chief Operating Officer of Taco Bell, and Get Schooled Executive 
        Director, Marie Groark, along with senior leadership from DPS in a conversation 
        about leadership with the inaugural class of the Get Schooled Leadership 
        Corps.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Detroit 
        students have been working hard all year to boost their attendance,&quot; 
        said Marie Groark, Executive Director of Get Schooled. &quot;We are excited 
        Big Sean is able to recognize their hard work and determination, and even 
        more thrilled that he will be able to join us for the announcement of 
        our first-ever student leadership corps, right here in Detroit.&quot;<br>
        Big Sean attended the Detroit Waldorf School, a school of art, from kindergarten 
        to eighth grade. He later attended and graduated from Cass Technical High 
        School. The chart-topping artist was first signed to Kanye West's music 
        label GOOD in 2007 and then to Island Def Jam in 2008. Following the release 
        of the trilogy of mixtapes for which he was initially recognized, Def 
        Jam dropped the artist's hit album, Finally Famous in July of 2011, followed 
        by the award-winning mixtape Detroit in September 2012 and Hall of Fame, 
        which debuted at number three in the Billboard 200, in August of 2013.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Challenge, which is made possible by a partnership between Get Schooled, 
        Viacom and DPS, took place over three rounds of competition this spring. 
        More than half of all DPS middle and high schools were active and engaged 
        in the campaign by checking into school every day on the Get Schooled 
        website, and participating in online discussions about school involvement, 
        career aspirations and study tips. The final round of the competition 
        included the prize of a visit from Big Sean.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I 
        am beyond pleased by the hard work and dedication our students have demonstrated 
        throughout the course of this campaign,&quot; said Dr. Cleo M. Moody, 
        principal at Bates Academy. &quot;Get Schooled has done a remarkable job 
        of making the very important issue of attendance relevant to students 
        by connecting it to popular culture. Seeing our kids come together in 
        pursuit of a common goal that resulted in improved attendance and an increased 
        level of engagement, was truly rewarding.&quot;</font></p>

        &quot;If we're going to develop a prepared workforce and the future leaders

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
        announce the initiative, Pharrell Williams headlined a kickoff event at

        June 7. More than 800 students, administrators, and community members 
        attended the event including Virginia delegate Ron Villanueva and Virginia
