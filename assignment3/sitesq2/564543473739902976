				<p>Opportunities within the field of advertising are vast and the majority of large ad agencies are headquarted or have offices in London. An internship presents a viable way of gaining experience and an insight into different areas of the industry. Below are a selection of handy hints and tips that we’ve put together to point those of you seeking careers within advertising in the direction of ad internship success!</p>
			</div>

				<p>Numbers. Data. Excel. Analytics just got sexy. With increasing an increasing proportion of our lives being conducted online, the amount of data being created in the world has increased exponentially in the past twenty years. This data is being used to inform organisations’ decisions and plays a major role in everything from Google’s business strategy to start up companies’ marketing plans. Analytics’ prominence in business is such that it touches a range of areas (from marketing to accounting) as well as being an individual discipline in its own right.</p>

				<p>With such rapid growth, Analytics is a brilliant area to break into and there are many ways you can impress potential employers.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="col-md-12 padding_left_right">
				<h3>Top free:</h3>
				<p>Comfortably the most prominent web analytics tool is <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>. This free service allows website owners to measure traffic to their website along with a huge range of information such as where visitors have come from, what platform they are using to view the website, how long they spend on each page – the list goes on. The only prerequisite for Google Analytics is that you have a website, so if you want to start using the tool it is advisable to set up your own blog or similar to practice with. Once Analytics is set-up it is advisable to read through Google’s extensive help documents to get an idea for the basics and also consult other guides on the internet (the <a href="http://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/microsites/google-analytics-guide/" target="_blank">Simply Business guide</a>, for example) to make sure you haven't missed anything. There is no substitute, however, for practice so try and use it on a live website to get a feel for how Google Analytics operates.</p>

				<p>A lot of data and information can be derived from social media, thus knowledge of analytics in this area is also a desirable trait. Have a look through <a href="http://tweakyourbiz.com/marketing/2013/03/06/10-top-social-media-monitoring-analytics-tools/" target="_blank">this useful list of tools</a>, many of which are free, to acclimatise yourself with the sorts of analysis you might be doing in an analytics internship. </p>

				<p>Of course there is one piece of software that is essential for analytics – Microsoft Excel. Excel is an incredibly powerful tool for working with data and a good working knowledge of it is very important for analytics roles. Much like Google Analytics, there is a wealth of free resources online to teach you how to use its many features. For basic business purposes, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/excel-countif-sum-functions-if-sumproduct-dollar-sign-2013-7?op=1" target="_blank">this article</a> is a good starting point.</p>

				<h3>Top paid:</h3>
				<p>Another important Google platform is Adwords, which allows advertisers to place adverts across the Google network and monitor their performance. Anyone looking for a career in advertising or digital should have a working knowledge of Adwords and again practice is the best way to learn. If you have set up your own website why not set aside a bit of money and try promoting your site. Experiment writing adverts, choosing keywords and monitoring what works and what doesn’t. You can normally get free credit when you spend a little (<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/adwords/coupons/" target="_blank">currently £75 free if you spend £25</a>) so a little goes a long way.</p>

				<p>Going back to Excel, if you want to go beyond the basics or have a little more in-depth guidance, there is a wealth of books available to talk you through all of the program’s functions. One of the most popular is John Walkenbach’s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Excel-2010-Bible-John-Walkenbach/dp/0470474874/ref=sr_1_1_bnp_1_pap?ie=UTF8&qid=1378892538&sr=8-1&keywords=excel+2010+bible" target="_blank">Excel 2010 Bible</a> but there are lots of alternatives available too. If you would prefer face-to-face tuition your local adult college may well have a course available, or a number of universities run more expensive courses such as this <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/courses/short-courses/applied-ms-excel-for-business" target="_blank">Applied MS Excel for Business</a> short course from City University.</p>

				<p>Internships in London within the third sector are notoriously competitive with many graduates keen to secure these prized opportunities. In order to help you fight off the competition, the following are a collection of recommended sources to help support your applications putting you in good stead for internship success.

				<p>One of the key pre-requisites that charities look for in candidates is previous evidence of involvement in charity work. The concept of starting small and volunteering first to build up contacts has proven to be successful method of entry to this sector, and there are many ways that you can go about obtaining such experience. It can be as simple and easy as addressing your local community and seeing where you can make a difference. Websites such as <a href="http://www.yoursquaremile.co.uk/" target="_blank">Your Square Mile</a> exist to help you find out how you can get involved in local activities and make a positive difference. Likewise, sites such as <a href="http://www.do-it.org.uk/)" target="_blank">Do-it</a> and <a href="http://greaterlondonvolunteering.org.uk/for-volunteers-2/?p=events-calendar.xml" target="_blank">Greater London Volunteering</a> act as a directory for sourcing local volunteering opportunities. <a href="http://vinspired.com/" target="_blank">vInspired</a> is another unique charity worth considering, with their focus on connecting young people with volunteering opportunities. For a more detailed insight into all aspects of volunteering check out <a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk/" target="_blank">Volunteering England</a>.</p>

				<p>Using your initiative and contacting charities directly and offering to volunteer with them is a pro-active approach worth considering. <a href="http://ivo.org/" target="_blank">Ivo</a> is a social network for the community-minded, connecting people and organisations that want to make their worlds a better place. It allows you to search through thousands of volunteering opportunities connecting with those that are advertising the vacancies.</p>

				<p>It’s also worth checking out KnowHow NonProfit's <a href="http://knowhownonprofit.org/people/volunteers/how-to-guides-volunteering" target="_blank">How-to guides to volunteering</a> - they are written by people with real world experience on subjects that matter to you.

				<p>The world we live in is becoming ever more digital-and IT-focused: from smartphones to social media, these disciplines are prominent features of our lives that are only going to continue developing and growing. As such they are a great place to start your career. They also span a huge range of industries and sectors, so developing digital and IT skills is relevant for many different career paths.

				<p>There are a huge range of free courses and resources available online to boost your CV and impress potential employers. <a href="http://econsultancy.com/" target="_blank">Econsultancy.com</a> is a great place to start. They post a huge range of brilliant blogs featuring industry trends, tips and advice to keep you up-to-date with the fast-moving world of digital. Members also get access to a range of reports and up-to-date research (key in an ever-changing landscape).</p>

				<p>The best thing for learning digital skills is to try doing things for yourself. Most digital-savvy candidates will be active on Facebook and Twitter so regularly using these (ideally to promote a society, organisation or even your own work/blog) is a pre-requisite. You can start to stand out from the crowd, however, by trying your hand at some of the other social networks: using Pinterest, Instagram and Vine to promote something is a great way to demonstrate an understanding of the ever-changing social landscape and your knowledge of some of its newer elements.</p>

				<p>If, however, you really want to make a good impression with employers you should really be engaging with platforms like <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank">Blogger</a>. While these are typically used as blogging platforms, they can also function as free-standing websites. Indeed many business websites are built on Wordpress, so experimenting by setting up your own site and gaining an understanding of how it works is a very desirable trait in a candidate. There are plenty of clear guides available online to help you get started.</p>

				<p>If you do set up your own website make sure that you install Google Analytics and use this to monitor the traffic – analytics is a major part of the digital world and a basic knowledge of it is often a must-have for these roles. See the Analytics section for more details!</p>

				<p>On the IT side of things, the vast majority of employers look very favourably upon anyone with (even basic) knowledge of coding or programming. Many people get intimidated by the idea of coding and think it is just for maths geniuses – but this isn't true! Anyone can code, and there is a range of free tools online to take you through the basics step-by-step. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> have a selection of brilliant courses that cover everything from HTML and CSS to Javascript and Python.

Have a look through and see if you can apply any of the principles to something you’re doing at the moment. Still at uni? Help publicise a society! Already graduated?

				<p>If you’ve got your eye on a career in PR, it’s also important to do your market research.

Some companies also upload press releases to their blog so you can learn how specific companies write press releases. For example, if you want to work within consumer PR, have a look at <a href="http://www.frankpr.it/" target="_blank">Frank</a>, <a href="http://www.thisismission.com/" target="_blank">Mission</a> and <a href="http://www.bluerubicon.com/" target="_blank">Blue Rubicon</a>.
