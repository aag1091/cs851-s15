Designed by Tag Front Architecture Studio, the new 900-square-foot, glass-enclosed space exudes the brand’s edgy West Coast-meets-East Coast aesthetic, with exposed-wood ceilings, industrial steel, concrete walls, contemporary Vibia lighting fixtures, and high-end, hand-finished furnishings. Custom Molteni C display cases house 100 optical and sunglass styles, including the Traveler ($500), Mach-Four ($950), and Statesman ($600) men’s models, as well as collections from Lancier and Thom Browne. The eyewear features UV-shielded lenses and acetate frames with a lustrous finish achieved through a process of tumbling in bamboo chips. Each pair is handcrafted in Japan and takes up to eight months to complete. (dita.com)
