There are individuals living in the United States today who have contact with the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) and other terrorist groups who have "a desire to conduct an attack" on U.S. soil, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."Johnson would not say how many such individuals the government is aware of, but did say the number is dwarfed by the number of people in Europe intent on carrying out out acts of terror there.And the ability to recruit and communicate through social media has only strengthened the ability to inspire lone wolves since the days just after 9/11, he said."The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security do a pretty good job of tracking the travel of individuals of suspicion, of investigating potential acts of terror or material support for terrorism," Johnson said. "Just this past Friday there were arrests of five individuals who were providing material support, allegedly, to ISIL."
