I have also said this to Mr. Prime Minister before," said Erdogan in a press conference at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport ahead of his visit to South America, where his office says he will seek to boost Turkey's bilateral economic ties.Erdogan said it was Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's decision to nominate Fidan.Late on Friday, Fidan resigned his post as head of National Intelligence Agency to stand in the upcoming June 7 general elections, the prime minister's office said.Fidan held his post since May 2010. Before, he worked as deputy undersecretary in the prime ministry when Erdogan was prime minister.He has been an influential figure in Turkey and made headlines several times mainly related to Turkey's solution process and its Middle East policy.Erdogan also slammed critical remarks from opposition parties for Fidanâ€™s standing as MP."Just as every public servant has the right to resign and become a candidate, the person at the top of the intelligence service can resign and become a candidate if a political party nominates him," Erdogan said, adding that there was no prohibition for public workers in this regard.
