From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!”“Great app - instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.”“Wow - I'm just blown away by how good this is! The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!”“Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only.”iPhone is a trademark of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.
