The blossoming bromance between 5 Seconds of Summer's Michael Clifford and Luke Hemmings is something that's been making us really happy recently. It's just too beautiful for words, so instead of trying to express ourselves through interpretive dance, we thought we'd pay tribute to #Muke with their best bromantic moments ever.Forget Romeo and Juliet because they've got nothing on Luke and Michael. Did Romeo ever push Juliet's hair out of her eyes while she was rocking out on stage? NO. Did Juliet ever thrust over-enthusiastically in Romeo's direction? DON'T THINK SO.So with that in mind, you'd better take a look at some of our fave Muke moments of all time ever, and then maybe write a poem about your overwhelming feels afterwards.
