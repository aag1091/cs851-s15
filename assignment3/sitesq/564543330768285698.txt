Downed chopper pilot says he told NBC 12 years ago that Williams’ story was falseThings have gone from bad to worse for NBC News and anchor Brian Williams.Don Helus, the pilot of the helicopter that took missile fire in the now-infamous tale Williams has been telling for more than a decade, told CNN’s Brian Stelter on Saturday that he informed NBC via email that Williams’ story was inaccurate 10 years ago, but he never heard back.Helus said he first heard of Williams’ story when a friend showed him a video of Williams telling his fabricated version in April 2003.If Helus’ story is true, Williams began fictionalizing the tale 12 years ago.“The fact is, Mr. Williams wasn’t in or near our aircraft at the time,” Helus told Stelter. “It saddens me that you have so many combat journalists out there who are in that situation, seeing those things happen, and more than likely, they don’t tell the story like that, with that embellishment.”Carmine Sabia Jr started his own professional wrestling business at age 18 and went on to become a real estate investor.

It was great for the ratings.John RichardsonJournalists are supposed to be unbiased and report the truth regardless of ratings that’s why the majority of Americans watch one news networkDouglas MooseSarcasm, dude. It’s a real language. Need to speak it if you are to enjoy this Interweb thingy!John RichardsonI speak sarcasm very well thank you you sir have failed to realize that sarcasm is lost in translation when converted to text instead of spokenDouglas MooseUh huh. If you say so. I had no problem understanding his meaning, and I didn’t need anyone to sound it out for me!John RichardsonIt’s a fact take an English lit class. And sarcasm is a sign of intelligence…the lowest sign of intelligence. Did you get that?Douglas MooseYou’re one of those people who has to have the last word, aren’t you? Here’s your chance! I’m done here. You obviously have nothing better to do other than engage someone over a non-issue. Aloha!Douglas MooseObama has taught us one thing well: if you get caught in a lie, either blame the listener for not being smart enough to catch him when he said it (like Gruber said), or backtrack and give a “what I really meant to say was …” excuse (ala ‘You can keep your policy and doctor’).Williams has probably lied many times about things that really matter to our lives and the nation. This one story only shows how outrageous it was this time. How many other lies have actually hurt us and helped a corrupt government by keeping the truth from the public?Jim McCormackSo how many other lies has he told ? His credibility is gone . See ya !
