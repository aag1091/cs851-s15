Normally on Wednesdays I receive information concerning possible QueanBull sessions for the weekend but yesterday my wife told me she had to make some additional ‘negotiations’.This morning my wife informed me that she realized one of her fantasies, which is my allergy.I will be pimped out to Kirsten on first Easter day.I indeed promised my wife last week to give it a try, but didn’t expect it to be realized this quick.Kirsten agreed to pay 500 Euros for having me Saturday evening and night and part of Sunday. The money will be donated to one of the charity projects my wife is involved in. I have no clue if this is expensive or cheap and I still have very mixed feelings about it.For me it introduces a new dimension to QueanBulling which I doubt is nice. But… I promised to give it a try and it’s a good virtue to try new things. And.. Kirsten is not bad company anyway, a bit bossy however ;-) She looks like the woman above, although Kirsten is bigger.This morning my wife confessed that she is fantasizing about taking me to Kirstens place, stay there for a cup of coffee, take the money and leave, and fetch me on Sunday late afternoon after which we have a family dinner.I need to take several outfits, including a tuxedo, as Sunday early afternoon Kirsten requested me to escort her to a classical concert near the city hall.Furthermore, Kirsten wants the full Monty, so my wife promised to deliver me ‘full’, which means I can’t come for two days.My wife is very excited, I am not sure whether I am, but a QueanBull has to do what a QueanBull has to do: satisfy women and himself.
