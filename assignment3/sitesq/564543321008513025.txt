Fan Creates Functional Custom Paper Mario AmiibosDeviantArt user NBros has created a pair of Paper Mario-inspired custom Amiibos that we're hoping Nintendo decides to make its own official versions of someday.It's a very simple, but also very effective design, which unsurprisingly is a good way to describe the Paper Mario video games' art style. NBros is actually selling their creations on eBay, which is perfect considering Nintendo may never release official Paper Mario Amiibos.
