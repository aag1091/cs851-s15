Selena Gomez Debuts a Waaaay Shorter 'DoIt's the year of the lob, we're telling you.Just hours ago, Selena Gomez took to Instagram to post a cute selfie. While we've been digging her au naturel beauty snaps as of late, we didn't think much of her posting another Insta-shot to her account. No big deal, right? Um, except for the fact that she used it as an under-the-radar way to debut a dramatic hair makeover.Posing in mirrored sunnies and a stylish pink coat, Selena showed off her brand spanking new long, layered bob. Yep, Sel is the latest celeb to join the lob hair club, which means we can now officially give the crop our stamp of approval as the season's must-try style.But! Before we get too excited, we should probably mention that the talented actress is currently filming her big new movie, The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving. This means that it is possible that the chop is only temporary and her (formerly) cascading locks are still intact.Still, we're positively loving the new 'do and we're really hoping that the look is here to stay. (No pulling a Lea Michele on us, Selena!)Loving it? Yep, you're not the only one. Despite the snap being posted not even 24 hours ago, it's already racked up almost 1 MILLION (!) likes. Clearly Selena's followers are just as style savvy as she is.
