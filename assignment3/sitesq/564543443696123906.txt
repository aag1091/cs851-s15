Arabian SightMain ContentArabian Sight“This Arabian mare was photographed in Dhashur, which is in the desert on the west bank of the Nile, not too far south of Cairo,” writes Glenn Jacobs, a member of our Your Shot photo community. “Because of the light, we waited until sunset to give this mare her temporary freedom. She was very much in tune with her handler, and he was able to guide her to the spot I had in mind for this shot. [It] was wide open, without any fence. The mare, though, always returned to her handler, which was a nice sight to behold.”Unbridled, unexpected freedom is what this beautiful mare is experiencing. All the while, her eye is on the camera and photographer. Then, back to her handler. All of this caught in one shot. It was worth the wait. Bravo!I am a follower and former trainer/riding instructor for American Saddlebreds. American Saddlebreds and Arabs did some cross breeding and developed a huge breed for popularity called the National Show Horse! This photo caught all the charisma and life in this Arabian. I love photos when emotions are caught in the image.Arabian horses are so amazing. They have been bred for thousands of years to be human-oriented, so it is no surprise to me that this mare always came back to her handler. My Arabian mare does the same thing, and comes galloping across the field to greet me when I get to the barn. :)
