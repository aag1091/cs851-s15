3rd Annual Blind Date with a Book GiveawayValentine’s Day. When most people hear that word (single people) we cringe, roll our eyes, get irritated, or cry, depending on how long we’ve been single. I’m NOT single but I still hate Valentine’s Day. I always have. You can call me Bah Humbug.Welllll, here at Great Imaginations, we have developed a fun way for our readers and book lovers to celebrate this holiday! And it’s our THIRD year doing it. It’s probably the most popular thing we DO here at Great Imaginations, so I look forward to it every year. Lyn wrote the first year’s post, Bekka wrote last year’s, but this year I thought I would take over since I’m such an upbeat, happy person. I also have a fun habit of rambling. What’s that? Get on with it? *middle finger* And now I am talking to myself.How does it work?Each of our book bachelors and bachelorettes have completed their Dating Profiles, including some of their hobbies and what they’re looking for in a potential reader! Once you’ve read through each profile, decide which mystery book you’d like to take out for a night on the town . . . or, you know, the couch (or the backseat of a Chevy Nova).There will be three winners chosen for this giveaway, and yes, it is international.

Good luck!Chenise J.I have no idea what the other books are and thus am scared to take a chance on them (WHAT IF THEY’RE BOOKS I DON’T WANT TO REEEEEAD?), but 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 I KNOW 7 I WANT A HOT NIGHT WITH 7 AGAIN. And I definitely did not just feel like that explanation of sex from friends just then.But yes, I’d choose book 7. The draft I read was fabulous and I only expect editing to have made it better!
