Roy Williams remembers North Carolina legend Dean SmithFormer North Carolina Tar Heels head coach Dean Smith, who won two national championships and 879 games as a head coach, died Saturday night at the age of 83. Smith retired in 1997 as the winningest men’s Division I college basketball coach. Current North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, who won the program’s first national championship since Smith’s departure in 2005, released a statement remembering his mentor Sunday morning.“It’s such a great loss for North Carolina – our state, the University, of course the Tar Heel basketball program, but really the entire basketball world. We lost one of our greatest ambassadors for college basketball for the way in which a program should be run. We lost a man of the highest integrity who did so many things off the court to help make the world a better place to live in.He set the standard for loyalty and concern for every one of his players, not just the games won or lost.He was the greatest there ever was on the court but far, far better off the court with people. His concern for people will be the legacy I will remember most.He was a mentor to so many people; he was my mentor. He gave me a chance but, more importantly, he shared with me his knowledge, which is the greatest gift you can give someone.”I found this on FTW and wanted to share: %link% For more great sports stories ... *visit For The Win: https://www.ftw.usatoday.com *follow @ForTheWin: https://www.twitter.com/forthewin *like FTW on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/usatodayftw
