The running joke during Andy Reid's tenure as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles was that he was always picking up players from his alma mater, BYU. "Best available Mormon."Well now that Chip Kelly is the head coach of the Eagles, that refrain has turned into "Best Available Duck", for his former Oregon players. (For those of you paying attention, that acronym spells B.A.D. Just sayin')Super Bowl XLIX was the most watch television show in history. The numbers at the end of the game were close to 121 million viewers. That's a whole lot of people watching and all of them...ALL of them think that the Seattle Seahawks decision to throw the ball on second and goal from the goal line was the worst call in the history of sports.The New England Patriots aren't to blame for "Deflate-Gate". Head coach Bill Belichick isn't to blame either. Don't look at Tom Brady. And that New England locker room attendant the NFL has identified as a "person of interest"? Forget about him.
