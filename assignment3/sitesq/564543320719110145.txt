real life is tragicBoyfriend, a Job? No I spend way too much time crying over character development. Also I'm a person who believes in the social, political and economical disequality between beyoncé and anyone else.The New York Times said half the increase in support of gay marriage is due to generational turnover. That’s what smart people call crazy uptight bitches dying. You guys lost, okay? And honestly, the rest of us are just going about our business, being normal, and waiting for you not to be around. And not because you can stop us from getting married, but just because you’re kind of annoying.
