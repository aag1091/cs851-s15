A good lookin’ Easter weekend, followed by a rainy weekToday’s rain moves out by late evening and our cloud cover decreases tonight. Winds will stay elevated enough to prevent a repeat of the dense fog we experienced this morning.In Saturday’s forecast, sunshine will be abundant with winds becoming southwesterly, acting as a conveyor belt for warmer air to travel in on this weekend. We’ll be windy, at times, on both days with our highest wind gusts in the 25-30 mph range.By Monday, we’re still monitoring the start of a wet pattern taking shape, which will be quite stubborn to move out. As a result, rounds of rain are set to track in each day next week and continue into the weekend. If some computer models are correct, we could pick up 2″+ of rain throughout next week. Get those umbrellas out and keep an eye on the forecast for updates in the days ahead.Share this:Like this:LikeLoading...AdvertisementWANE.com provides commenting on many stories to allow for constructive discussion.
