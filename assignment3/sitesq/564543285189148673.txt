Developing Countries ForumFriday, May 29, 2015Interest in robotics is increasing in many parts of the world, and developing countries are no exception. From research projects aimed at developing novel robotic systems for unique challenges, to education and outreach programs that use robotics to enhance students' interest in STEM fields, the collection of robotics projects in developing countries provides a fascinating panorama of the potential and impact robotics can have around the world.For the first time at ICRA 2015, a forum will be specifically dedicated to highlighting robotics work in developing countries. During this forum, invited speakers will speak on current trends in robotics research and education in developing countries, an interactive display at the conference will feature information on a diverse array of robotics projects in developing countries around the world, and opportunities will be provided for remote participation in these activities. Work from a wide range of categories will be featured in the interactive display, including but not limited to research, education, outreach, academic work, industry work, governmental work, and NGO work. Moreover, the interactive display will be launched at the conference but will sustain beyond the conference to connect the international community interested in this topic.The forum at ICRA 2015 will allow for deeper interactions, both in person and via remote participation, with authors of selected projects highlighted in the interactive display, and with other relevant invited participants. Discussions will center on themes such as relevant applications, current trends and future directions of robotics in developing countries, opportunities and challenges of robotics work in developing countries, and opportunities for "south-south" as well as "north-south" collaboration in this context.Opportunities for remote participate will attempt to ensure that every interested potential participant has an opportunity to be a part of this forum irrespective of location logistics. A number of options to make the remote participation possible are currently been explored. These include the following:remote conference access which includes two way video and audio conferencing,real time chat rooms for online contributions during talks and panels,email contributions, andsocial networking via Twitter, Facebook etc.Conversations will continue beyond the conference, centered on the web-based interactive display that will continue to be accessible on the World Wide Web beyond ICRA 2015.Invited SpeakersTo be announced.Schedule9:15-10:30: Robotics research in and for the developing worldInvited speakersInteractive display highlightsRound table discussion11:00-12:15: Robotics education and outreach in the developing worldInvited speakersInteractive display highlightsRound table discussion14:30-15:40: Robotics deployment in the developing worldInvited speakersInteractive display highlightsRound table discussion16:10-17:20: Collaborations and future directionsContinuing plan for interactive displayPanel discussion and open forumOrganizersM.
