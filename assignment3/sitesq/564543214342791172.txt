The Bean Foundation strives to promote Hiv/ Health awareness among the people of East Texas through its annual Hip Hop For Hiv concert . Last year The Bean Foundation was able to test over 571 people in East Texas and will be trying to at least triple those numbers this year ….. but only through your help . This show isn’t just your normal Hip Hop concert ,the only way for you to attain a ticket is to be tested …… Yes that’s it just tested and you get a ticket to the biggest concert of the summer . Now as we all know The Bean Foundation is an non-profit organization and all of our sponsorship is greatly appreciated but we’re now reaching out to YOU. This is something that helps increase awareness at a pace in which HIV is spreading and hopefully through your help we can start to slow down something that is destroying the fabric of our community . We’re not asking for a hand-out but a donation to fight for a cause that has affected us all in some way , shape or form . in order for things to change around us we must first make a valiant effort ourselves to change….. Today is that day … Fight For A Change .Campaign Not Ready There's an issue with this Campaign Organizer's account. Our team has contacted them with the solution, it's a simple fix!
