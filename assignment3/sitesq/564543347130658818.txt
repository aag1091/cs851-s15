Elvis fans and collectors are all over the world and still go to visit Graceland. We have come across some of the final newspaper articles memorializing the death of Elvis. The price reflects the condition that the papers are in. They have been folded and a couple of small tears and they have the vintage yellowing a newspaper gets from over the years. But these are definitely for the Elvis fan collector.
