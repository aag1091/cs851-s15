A Michelin Star For The Blue BayShare:Congratulations to Chef Marcel Ravin at the Monte Carlo Bay’s, Blue Bay for gaining the restaurants first Michelin Star.I’ve been lucky enough to eat at the Blue Bay many times since it opened in 2005. One of the first things I do when arriving at the Monte Carlo Bay is to browse Chef Ravin’s latest menu, always inventive and always packed full of flavours. I don’t ever recall a time when there wasn’t something new to tempt me.It’s dining for the inquisitive – you’re desperate to know if Chef’s latest flavour combinations work and in truth sometimes I’ve felt he’s got it ever so slightly wrong, but for me that’s all part of the fun of Ravin’s menus.Rest assured a meal at the Blue Bay won’t disappoint, there’s always a course that will delight you and keep you coming back for more. Can’t wait for my next visit.
