How Small-Business Owners Can Avoid BurnoutJAMES SCHRAGER: Fact: Many small-business owners simply burn out after a certain number of years running at full speed. This is the result of the pace so many small businesses owners feel they need to maintain. And in many cases, that pace is not an illusion.Solutions include being open shorter hours, closing on certain days of the week, or developing a few really capable employees or part-owners who can cover for you. There is no doubt that each of these comes at a cost.Shorter hours mean less sales, but if you carefully analyze your hourly sales tally, you may be able to eliminate hours and still do well. Which times of the day are your worst? Is it possible to close a day you are now open? How much will it matter if you are closed that day?How hard will it be to hire someone good enough to cover for you? What will you do when you are not at the business? How important to your business and, perhaps, your sanity, is that activity? It is often hard to maintain a life, much less a life with any balance in it, and still go at full speed in a small business.The real question is: How much is it worth to avoid burnout? Are you willing to earn a bit less every year but be able to stay in business?A small business is wildly exciting and can take over your life before you know it. Make sure you think about ways to avoid overload. Once you get beyond the edge, it is often too late to adjust.James Schrager is a clinical professor of entrepreneurship and strategic management at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
