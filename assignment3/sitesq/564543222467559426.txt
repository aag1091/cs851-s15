A chance to learn about what you are, how you're made up and the powerful energy you have within to heal and manage yourself and others in completely natural and harmonious way.I know throughout the movie the word 'belief' is used several times however, I KNOW I can (using my mind)- heal my body, strengthen my body and prevent my body from becoming dis-eased... Now, knowing that, what do i need 'belief' for? .. This works, it's a fact, I've used energy healing on myself several times so i know it is a fact that this works... "Belief" (as far as I'm concerned)- is NOT necessary.
