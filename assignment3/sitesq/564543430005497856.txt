"Live in Tokyo" was originally released on VHS only.In 2010 it has finally been released officially on DVD, but only as part of the collection "Still The Orchestra Plays". (buy it on iTunes here: http://itunes.apple.com/it/album/powe...)The show has a great vibe and the playing is excellent. A night not to forget. Howewer, the video material reflects the technology available at the time, and it's not an HD filming. That's why Savatage and earMUSIC decided to release it as a "free bonus disc" on the limited edition of the collection that started the Savatage catalogue reissue series with bonus tracks.The CD Edition of "Live in Japan" will be reissued by earMUSIC in November. The CD is being remastered and it will include 2 songs from the show in Tokyo that were not originally featured on the first CD release.
