This is the portable version of Efficient To-Do List, a software which lets you organize tasks in a simple manner. The tool can be seamlessly handled by individuals of any experience level.The interface of the program is clean and pretty intuitive. So, you can add a new task by setting a subject, start and due date, priority level, status, comment and reminder.But you can also add attachments and file links, set the task to recur regularly, organize categories, view tasks according to various terms (e.g. overdue, high priority, current month), use a search function, as well as backup and restore data.On top of that, you can set a program password, customize the toolbar, import and export tasks, enable Portable Efficient To-Do List to automatically run at system startup, make file associations, allow multiple instances, customize a calendar, enable automatic backups, and more.The simple-to-use application runs on a very low amount of system resources, has a good response time, includes a help file and didn't freeze, crash or pop up errors during our tests. We haven't come across any issues and strongly recommend Portable Efficient To-Do List to all users.Portable Efficient To-Do List was reviewed by Elena Opris, last updated on February 2nd, 2015
