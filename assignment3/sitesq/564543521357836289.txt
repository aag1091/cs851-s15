A mystery insider, who reckons that they're pretty chummy with Shamrock Tattoo Parlour in Los Angeles, told The Daily Star: "Harry made everyone sign confidentiality agreements so the girl's letters are a secret at the moment."But he had two sets of initials together - 'HS' is one of them, of course, but everyone's saying that the other initials are 'NL' - for Nadine Leopold."Right, now we have two things to say about this: 1. Everyone had to sign a confidentiality agreement, but this cheeky so-and-so has quickly gone and blabbed to the papers, right, okay then.2. "Everyone is saying that the other initials are 'NL'" - Everybody is saying that, eh? But nobody has confirmed? Nobody has confirmed what these super-confidential and lurved up initials inked onto the 21-year-old's body are?Well, on that note we're sure that we all have our own theories as to who the second set of initials might belong to...The source went on to explain that Harry organised for the tattooist to come to his house in order to keep the ink super duper private, sharing: "Harry used to go to tattoo parlours when he came to LA."But he gets mobbed so much that he has an artist fo to his house instead."We just hope that the person who the initials belong to was there to hold his hand.Just in case you weren't feeling emosh enough over the fact that Harry might have permanently etched a tribute to somebody onto his body, the singer is pretty well known for how much he loves a good ol' fashioned personal tattoo.
