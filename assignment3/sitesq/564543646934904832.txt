I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic, Then you post it up, thinkin' that its makin' me sick, I see you calling, I be makin' it quick, Imma answer that s**t like: "I don't f**k with you", B**ch I got no feelings to go, I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go, I mean for real, f**k how you feel, F**k your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah, And everyday I wake up celebratin' s**t, why?, Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy b**ch.
