Scott West's Standing On The Moon: "Scott West's music reminds me of Coldplay with crunch, but I also hear the influences of Sting, The Police, Queen, The Beatles and Jerry Lee Lewis. West teams up on this song with Tesla's lead guitarist, bassist & drummer (Frank Hannon, Brian Wheat & Troy Luckketta). Official Selection and Top 3 Music Videos in the 2007 Sacramento International Film & Music Festival. Standing On The Moon appeared on Scott West & Sex On Sunday's 'Sex On Sunday' tm CD, which distributed over 170,000 copies. West's band and Sex On Sunday CD were voted 'Best local band,' 'Best self produced CD,' and 'Best local aphrodisiac' in the 2006 Sacramento News & Reviews 'Best of Sacramento' Readers Poll." Standing On The Moon was the first single release from West's SOS CD. West followed with Room 413 and Keep It Clean as his second and third singles from SOS."
