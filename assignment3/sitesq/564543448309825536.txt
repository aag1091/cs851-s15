When the child, who was later identified as Starr, tries to go about her own business and walk past the officer, the officer freaks out and grabs the child by the arm, throwing her against the wall.“The officer was hollering at her and said, ‘Little girl, get down here, and so Starr said, ‘My name is not little girl, it’s Starr.’ Starr came on down the steps, and Starr said that’s when the officer grabbed her,” Starr’s grandmother, Vanessa Ward, told WBAL.When Star attempted to free herself, the officer grabbed the child by the hair and began fighting with her.At that point, Starr’s cousin Diamond witnessed the altercation but did not realize that it was an officer involved. When she attempted to rescue her young cousin from the attack, the rabid officer turned on her and pulled out a Baton, striking the girl in face. Diamond had her back against the wall and her hands up in the air when she was hit with the baton.There was reportedly another unnamed girl involved in the scuffle, and it was later reported that the officer used pepper spray on all three of the girls. The school did not inform the family of the attack, but they had to learn about the situation later from paramedics when the girls were hospitalized.“The officer kind of comes from behind and reaches around and sprays them multiple times in the face with pepper spray. It’s disgusting,” Jared Jaskot, the family’s attorney told reporters.The criminalization and brutalization of black and brown bodies starts at an early age, most notably in our schools. It feels like there’s no safe haven for us and our children. We need SROs out of our schools immediately and a concrete strategy to end the school-to-prison pipeline. We say no more to this obscene violence. #saveourchildren#staywoke #farfromover
