HeadlinesPrince Charles to British Muslims: If you come here to live, you must abide by our valuesIn a staunch defence of Britain’s ‘Christian standpoint,’ he denounced the radicalisation of young Britons by Islamic fanatics and said they should show more respect to ‘the values we hold dear’.People who had ‘come here, were born here or go to school here’ should ‘abide by our values,’ he said.

Well, yes, Harry had to be pulled from his station in Afghanistan and was none too thrilled about it… his contingent had swore to “Death Before Dishonour” to protect the prince but he would have none of being their cause of death. He exhibited noble and caring sentiment, as far as I’m concerned.
