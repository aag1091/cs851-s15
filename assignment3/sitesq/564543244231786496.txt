PagesSaturday, June 14, 2014My Top 20 Favorite Business & Entrepreneurial QuotesWhile I'm all about digital marketing and social media, I certainly have a love for entrepreneurship (I've been an entrepreneur since age 12) and the big picture of business and economics in general. Business can be challenging in any profession, and often times it can be useful to seek motivation from great men and women. You may find some common themes in many of these quotes that really speak to me such as perseverance, resilience, and bravery. Here are some of my favorite inspirational quotes from business icons:17) "Live daringly, boldly, fearlessly. Taste the relish to be found in competition - in having put forth the best within you." -Henry Kaiser18) "I'm not a businessman, I'm a business...man" -Jay-Z19) "If you want to be successful in a particular field, perseverance is one of the key qualities." -George Lucas20) "Chase the vision, not the money, the money will end up following you." -Tony HsiehSo those are currently my Top 20 Business and Entrepreneurial quotes. It's always tough to make any list because inevitably you still leave out some of the biggest business legends and moguls. These may be subject to change but fear not, I will keep this updated over the months / years and I'm sure you will see additional ones on my other social media. Best of luck in business to all of you!
