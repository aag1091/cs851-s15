I have no complaint with this Mike's (now Crew) Car Wash. The attendant whom received my payment and sold me another coupon book of five regular washes (the fifth one is actually free) was pleasant and professional, as was the attendant whom prepared my car to enter the car wash.When completed, my car was clean with no remaining dirt spots. Additionally, whenever I come here and there are several customers waiting, they always handle the crowd efficiently, ensuring that the lines stay orderly and that plenty of staff members are available to properly direct the traffic.So let me say Mike's is nothing new to most people. I don't know if any of you have seen the Goldfish commercial where the mom and kids are going through a car wash but that is exactly what it is like for our family when we go to Mike's. (Going through the ocean with bubbles, octopuses, waves etc) Their customer service is always outstanding. When I have the babies in the car they draw smiley faces on the windows and wave at them. My kids think it is a special treat.Crew's Car Wash is the only car wash that I ever use, the employees taking payments are always young and excited about their job. Whenever I pull up, I am always greeted with a smiling face. Prices are quite reasonable as well! Every time I use Crew's, I am always satisfied. Never am I left wishing that I could go through again due to dirt left on my car. But even if I did, they would allow another time through for free if I am not satisfied with my first car wash. The only reason that I could not give them the full 5 stars is that there is always such a long line whenever I go. While they have an efficient system set up to keep the line moving in a left to right pattern, there are always one or two block heads who cannot wait their turn and mess the whole system up, causing confusion and frustration. All in all, I love Crew's and everything they offer!Keep up the great work!
