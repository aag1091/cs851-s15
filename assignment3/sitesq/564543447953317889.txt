Wild idea of the day, a Drachma Bitcoin!Sunday February 8, 2015Whoever I speak to seems to think that Greece and EU will work things out and that Greece will stay in the Euro. I hope so. But I still believe there is a good chance that Tsipras will not get debt reductions and in order to keep his electoral promises will declare a corralito (lock deposits inside the Greek banks) and default. After that the question is who will finance Greece day to day existence if Greece stays in the euro. Russia to split EU? China? Nobody? If nobody then Greece will have to create its own currency again. In that case will it be a Drachma type currency or a Bitcoin fork? Like would it make sense for a country in this situation to start a Bitcoin like currency? I think it would, as it would be the Bitcoin with the greatest chance to gain world wide acceptance as it would start with a captive market that would dwarf the existing Bitcoin.
