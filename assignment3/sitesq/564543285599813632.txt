The structure, which was in working order, was one of five in Brum that were listed for preservation. Because of its protected status, approval for it being dismantled and removed was given only on condition that it was re-erected elsewhere.On February 14, 1987, the Birmingham Mail reported that city council chiefs were asking for suggestions on where to relocate that particular men’s street urinal.The Birmingham Mail of February 21, 1987, reported that Mr A R Gilbert of Pamela Road, Northfield, said it should go to "the new Snowhill Station" or "the canalside conservation area around Brindley Walk or Gas Street."Mr Gilbert wrote: "Both these areas have a long association with urinals, so the historic link could be maintained into the next century."Mr C R Griffiths of Bunns Lane, Dudley, suggested a new home for the lavatories could be found at Dudley's Black Country Living Museum, claiming: "These toilets have served us Black Country men very well over the years."Meanwhile, Mrs J F Cameron, of Middle Park Road, Selly Oak, said the toilets should instead go to the Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings at Bromsgrove.Mr M Sheppard, of Clarence Road, Sparkhill, was more scathing about the scheme, writing: "No right-minded ratepayer would want to view this filthy old relic, so why waste more public money?"An official from Birmingham Railway Museum at Tyseley had offered to have the old urinal, and the council eventually agreed. But there is still some mystery about where it finally ended up.The protected pissoir at Vyse Street, Hockley proudly proclaims itself as The Temple of Relief and is listed by English Heritage for special architectural and historic interest.The urinal was made around 1880 at the Walter Macfarlane Saracen Foundry in Scotland and uses a "Floral Adamish" design.It’s described as a "cast iron gents formed of standard cast panels between slender column standards and capped by cresting. The panels have grotesque and geometric decoration in relief."
