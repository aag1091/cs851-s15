The Girl at Table 5The Girl at Table 5by Christopher BradyThere is a girl, blue-eyed and sweet, offering glances to me from across the restaurant.Sultry and blonde with a with just a slight tinge of brown pecking through, beautiful not in the way that, say, the Rondo alla Turca is beautiful, (she’s more Vivaldi than Mozart) but more in the way that the smell of fresh sage, or the first trickle of summer sweat is beautiful.She’s sneaking a bite of what I think might be a bagel, no cream cheese (how strange),peekpeekpeeking up at me-eversosubtlelike the last breaths of a dying chime.She doesn’t think I’ve noticed.“More coffee for ya?” and I extend my cup for more bitter burned slop-water.Shy too, this one, taking miniscule nibbles of loaf and gruel raising a cotton pale hand, gently brushing a blushful cheek and drifting her effortlessly flawless face towards the window, hiding from me the shameful truth that she too, needs to eat.She’s a doe, skiddish and serene pausing at a puddle to drink while I crawl through the grass, desperate for the slightest touch of softness, holding my exuberance in reserve, not daring to break a branch or startle a fallen leaf from its burial plot, inching closer but never too close to that figure sitting two-sections-and-three-tables-over.I love the way she curves. The line of her nape, the form of her back, the shape of her. A man would wish to be bold in her presence if he could only muster the courage.I’m staring, and so is she.She smiles an earthquake and blushes,and I look away.Chris Brady is a Professional Writing and Editing major and a Creative Writing minor in his junior year at YSU.
