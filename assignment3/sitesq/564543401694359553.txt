Keep in mind that for special and/or custom orders, any pattern that you might see will change depending on the colors i have on hand. I do try and use the same colors, even though the pattern might be a little different.Note to polymer clay wearers and users:The ACMI (Art and Creative Materials Institute, Inc.) is the organization that regulates Polymer Clay (http://www.acminet.org).Please note that polymer clays (namely Sculpey Premo which is what i use) conforms to health and safety regulations set by the ACMI.Polymer clay, like bone, shell, wood, etc., is a porous material and should never be worn to stretch your ears or if they are not completely healed. As of the last formula change, Sculpey Premo, which is what I use, has only .025 percent phthalates. This is equivalent to what is in water bottles, juice bottles, items we use to carry and store food, and many other plastics that we use daily.Take care of your polymer clay items for a long life. To take care of your polymer clay items, clean with warm water each time before you wear them. Handle them as delicate jewelry, they are strong and will flex, but with too much force, they can possibly break.
