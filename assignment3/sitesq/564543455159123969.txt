JK Simmons has won the Bafta for Best Supporting Actor for his role in jazz thriller Whiplash.The 60-year-old, who plays an abusive conductor in the film, has previously won a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild award for his performance, and was the firm favourite to win Best Supporting Actor at the Baftas.Backstage at the ceremony, Simmons said of his next move following his win: "There are more interesting offers coming my way, I'm looking for things that are different, I'm not looking for another Fletcher."Many films that are thinking outside the box are getting a lot of awards attention recently. Making a movie is pretty easy compared to getting a movie made, so hopefully this will open the doors for other interesting films," he said.The indie favourite, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January last year, has been nominated for a Bafta in the Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound categories.
