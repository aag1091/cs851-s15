IN FOCUSDANS LA MIREProgress continues on the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport pedestrian tunnel being constructed under the Western Gap.A number of the tunnel’s final finishes are now being put into place. The glass windows and entranceways in both the mainland pavilion and the island-side atrium have now been installed, the brickwork in the pavilion has been completed, and the majority of the tiling inside the tunnel’s interior has been laid. The installation of the escalators and elevators on both sides of the tunnel continues to be a major focus in the tunnel’s construction, with the rubber handrails being installed on the escalators in the coming days. Once open, the tunnel will serve as a convenient and predictable passageway for people to access Billy Bishop Airport, building on the already world-class experience the airport offers to residents and visitors as they arrive and depart from Toronto.The final stages of construction on the tunnel will include the hook-up of the remaining City of Toronto water and sewer mains innovatively built directly into the tunnel’s drifts, architectural finishes, and completion of the tunnel's connecting terminal structures. As part of PortsToronto’s commitment to environmental sustainability, all of the tunnel’s electricity needs, as is the case with all of Billy Bishop Airport’s operations, will be powered by 100 per cent green energy.With the tunnel’s opening targeted for late spring, PortsToronto looks forward to soon welcoming the first travellers through the tunnel.For recent images of the tunnel’s construction and more information about the project, click here.TwitterWEATHERCONDITIONS MÉTÉOROLOGIQUESPortsTorontoPortsToronto operates the Billy Bishop Airport, the Port of Toronto and the Outer Harbour Marina.
