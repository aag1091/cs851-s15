Matson 32 - 35 CamborneCamborne recorded a hard fought away win at Matson to consolidate 4th spot in the South West One table after battling back from 2 0-3 down. Regular no.8 David Roberts filled in at centre for the Cherry & Whites who played with great commitment and spirit to fully deserve their bonus point win on the road at last in Gloucester. After David Mankee’s early penalty had leveled matters the home side powered well in front in the opening half hour. Just before half time fly half Mankee landed a 2nd penalty to cut the deficit before No 8 Neil Stanleick crashed over to reduce the arrears further for an 20-11 scoreline at the break. After the interval ‘Town’ got closer when stalwart Roberts dotted down with Mankee’s conversion leaving Matson only two points in front. The visiting pack were now well on top and from a line out catch and drive hooker Stuart Milliner was bundled over for Mankee to convert and Camborne were in front for the first time in the match. The home side soon levelled with an unconverted try but Mankee then coolly booted another penalty to make the score 25-28. Well inside the final quarter the Camborne forwards were halted illegally in full cry rumbling towards the home try line and the referee awarded a Penalty Try. Mankee easily added the routine conversion to take ‘Town’ ten points up and though Matson hit back late on they were not to be denied.
