Hayden had held the title for 378 days. Santana follows in the footsteps of many of women’s wrestling’s finest, from The Fabulous Moolah to Mildred Burke and Leilani Kai, who have held the title since its inception in 1935.How is she doing great by winning a useless title? NWA hasn’t been revelant since splitting with TNAHC DuranThe separation of NWA from TNA has diminished TNA more than it has NWA.Tarantula88LOL you mark, go and read Colt Cabana and Adam Pearce and what they did to the NWA title.HC DuranThe NWA, even after Cabana and Pearce, has a better overall heritage than that of TNA. And that’s coming from someone who likes TNA.Chris HillOnly to a retardChris HillLMAO is that why TNA is on TV and people are asking if NWA is still alive?HC DuranLife is more than TV. NWA has a legacy that is superior to the largely forgettable history of TNA.Chris HillLMAO stick to your shitty divas and crappy indies you have no idea what your talking aboutHC DuranYou seem to have no idea I am talking about the whole history of the NWA, prior to th current era of TNA, OR the indies.Dominik K.But she’s still a wrestler and can find a job. I was scared that she won’t be in this industry because I saw a photo titled “Brittany in her second job”RhawkBecause Santana has been winning titles and matches since leaving TNA, something she never did while she was with them.Tarantula88still glad she’s gone from TNA, lol the NWA are still a thing?http://twitter.com/sashasbanks Wesleyomg that new design looks flawless and Santana is soo beautiful. congrats to her! glad to see she got that major championship in her hands now. ?????Chris HillSo wheres the major championship?http://twitter.com/sashasbanks Wesleyum can I fucking remind you that Moolah sold the NWA Women’s Championship to the WWF (later WWE) Women’s Championship?this title was created back in 1954 and has been defended in some great matches. instead of asking next time just check the title’s history dude, lmfao..Chris HillYet it doesn’t mean shit today just another crappy indy title that nobody cares about#HotMesscongrats! I am so happy to know she’s doing well!WomanIsn’t Maria the FWE champ??LIGHTSOUTShe was, she lost the belt in Octoberhttp://twitter.com/sashasbanks Wesleyshe lost the title to Ivelisse on October 4. Candice defeated Ivelisse and became the new champion. basically Ivelisse is screwed once again as her reign ended in less than 1 day……RhawkAlready being treated better in the independents than she ever was in TNA. Their loss, everyone elses gain.Chris HillYeah for the 3 people who actually care about the IndysRhawkAre you one of them? Because you sure don’t sound like it…Chris HillHell no i don’t give a crap about the indys i actually have a life to liveRhawkI don’t, know, where to start commenting on this. I’ll just leave it there.Chris HillLMAO being a champion on the Indys means nothing nobody cares besides maybe a couple internet marks who live in their parents basementDavid MuscarellaWow. You sir are a jerk. People who follow the indies actually spend money on tickets and travel as opposed to people who just watch whatever is on free TV. If you like women’s wrestling AT ALL, you owe it to yourself to watch SHIMMER, SHINE, WSU, and a bunch of other feds that actually let women WRESTLE. They actually work hard and are not just eye candy or some sex object. Lots of people from TNA and WWE came from the indies yeah know. Emma, Paige, AJ Lee, Natayla, etc.MarshySince she has been gone from TNA that she is proving that life is at a better state for her and that she doesn’t have to wait in line for a title shot, now that she is the NWA Women’s Champion.WatchYoWeaveShe should change her Twitter handleArt Of Professional WrestlingThat’s great news very happy for her.DivaliciousFanDidn’t Maria hold that FWE title for more than a year?http://twitter.com/sashasbanks Wesleyshe held it for like two years. 626 days was the length of that reign but she lost it to Ivelisse in October.DivaliciousFanI hoped WWE would sign her after TNA, she had potential. I was excited for TNA having new blood, but unfortunately they didn’t keep her.Chris HillI hope WWE signs her too she would fit in with the rest of the awful divashttp://marcktvmovies.blogspot.mx/ Marck-WWEDivasSantana Garrett is great and would love to see her in WWE NXT, making a name of herself.JamesGangLeaderTNA failed with Santana. Oh well, their lossTarantula88She was terrible, very overrated some of her stuff with Madison Rayne was just cringeworthy.http://twitter.com/sashasbanks Wesleyhow was she overrated when she got only one win (in her debut) and lost every match she was put in, omg ????????????Number OneThat’s true. I expected her to be KO Champion, but they never really pushed her. Still enjoyed watching her in TNA, though.DJCongrats Santana! Glad she’s getting treated better now.AJ’s Sexually Spread TalentsTNA’s loss. I think she was great in the ring, one the mike and could act pretty well. I still remember that segment where she called out Madison and attacked her.Off: Is this really the only world women’s title? I think I read somewhere that it is.About Diva DirtWhen it comes to female wrestling and the internet, there is no site more popular than Diva Dirt.
