Justin Bieber rocks a giant owl tattoo on his arm, so of course it was only fitting that we ‘Animorph’ him into the wise old bird.While the Photoshopped transformation basically had us peeing our pants from laughter (we can’t even deal with that second image), Justin actually shares a lot of personality traits associated with the owl — especially as of late.The ‘Home to Mama’ singer may be just a month shy of 21, but he’s acting more mature than we’ve ever seen him before. He’s owning up to his past mistakes and taking responsibility for his actions — and he’s doing it in an incredibly honest and real way. It’s clear that he’s speaking from a genuine place, and he’s doing so with the kind of wisdom that you can only achieve with experience — and maturity. So take flight, Bieber Owl. We got you.Beliebers, check out our rendering of JB transforming into an owl in the picture above.Welcome back to PopCrushIt appears that you already have an account created within our VIP network of sites on .
