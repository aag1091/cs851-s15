Today I have AWESOME RECIPES FROM BETTY and we interview this unique lady! Plus we hear from Madame Rootabega, Valentino, and Bison Bentley! And what stresses us out the most? That question, for one. We find out the answer on this show.I went to see a band I've interviewed on this show, Cure For Gravity, (you can hear the interview under the "Interviews from 2014" section), along with another band I would love to get on the show, Mullerette, and I got there early per yoooooozh (maybe too early). There was an attractive woman sitting all alone in front of me. Usually in this case you can safely assume she's with one of the band members or someone that works at the venue. Or possibly she's waiting for a friend. Nope, I spoke to her and she just wanted to check out live music by herself. I thought, What a co in kee dink! I'm alone, too, and I like to check out live music. Yet she shunned me. Last I checked, I'd bathed. I guess she REALLY wanted to be alone. Fine, but geez, it's not like I'm Satan.Next show more shenanigans with Chely Shoehart, Floyd the Floorman, and John Deer the Engineer!
