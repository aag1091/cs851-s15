It was even shared by Lynda Carter, the TV actress who played the titular hero on “Wonder Woman.”The photo shows her holding a sign with this statement in big bold letters: “My last day of chemo. It was tough, but I was tougher.”Sophia’s father, Ricky Sandoval, told the San Antonio Express-News he never thought the photo would get this much attention when he first posted it to Facebook. He hopes it provides a message of hope to other children going through chemotherapy and brings more attention to research in pediatric cancers.“If we can spread the word, that’s more awareness,” he said.Sophia’s mother, Rossio Sandoval, noticed in late May that Sophia was regularly losing her balance. So she took her to the hospital for some tests.Sophia was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a cancerous brain tumor doctors found beneath her cerebellum. Between 250 and 500 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with this type of tumor each year.Doctors immediately removed the tumor in surgery, and Sophia couldn’t walk for a month.Sophia will return to the doctors for an MRI and another test to check that she is cancer-free. Sandoval said Sophia still loses her balance on occasion, but she’s back to playing with her siblings.“She’s so strong … Now she can jump, now she can run.” Rossio Sandoval said. “Right now, she’s like, ‘I don’t even need the walker.”
