Marriages Reveal 'Salome' for Sargent HouseAnyone catching Marriages on their current U.S. tour with Helms Alee will be treated to live versions of tracks from their upcoming full-length debut, Salome. The rest of us will have to wait to hear these on the album itself, which lands April 7 through Sargent House.A press release explains that the nine-song LP was tracked at the end of 2014 in Los Angeles, with the collection said to mesh post-punk tendencies and stoner rock textures. Marriages' lineup has changed since the release of their 2012 EP Kitsune, with vocalist/guitarist Emma Ruth Rundle and bassist/keyboardist Greg Burns now joined by drummer Andrew Clinco (Drab Majesty). David Clifford (Red Sparowes, Slaves) had previously sat behind the kit.The new Marriages LP comes in the wake of Rundle's 2014 solo LP, Some Heavy Ocean, with the sounds of the group's reportedly shoegazing new collection being compared to Cocteau Twins, Russian Circles, and Echo and the Bunnymen.Along with Salome's tracklisting and Marriages' tour itinerary, you'll find the new album's first single, "Skin," down below.
