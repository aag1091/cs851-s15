Door staff will use police issue ‘Alco-Blow Detectors’ to see if customers are too drunk to be allowed inside. Anyone registering a reading of more than double the 35mg drink-drive limit (70mg) could be refused entry.Andy Wilson was among readers who threatened to take their trade elsewhere.He wrote: “41 pubs to avoid... Great news for the rest of the city pubs.”But Fi Fi Trixibelle was among a minority who welcomed the breathalyser plans.She wrote: “Think its a brilliant idea. This way it promotes safe drinking! From someone who used to not know my limits this is a fabulous idea to help young people who binge drink as that is just the NORM within our society.“Only those who like to get absolutely drunk would disagree. Alcohol has a lot to answer for.”As well as targeting booze-fuelled violence police say they are also using the scheme to battle ‘pre-loading’ on cheaper supermarket bought booze.Officers say they have seen some customers downing bottles of vodka or wine in the street, minutes before they enter Birmingham’s pubs and clubs.Police are keen to stress that other factors will also be taken into account by the pub and bar staff, including demeanour and other signs of drunkenness.A similar smaller scale scheme was piloted in student bars around Selly Oak, but this is the first mass roll out across Birmingham’s buts bar and club areas.The Alco-Blow tubes are funded by the council’s Night Time Economy Steering group and have already been rolled out primarily to bars in Broad Street.Central Birmingham Police Sergeant Dave Francis told the Birmingham Mail earlier this week that the scheme has been a proven success in other parts of the country. He said: “In recent years we’ve seen an explosion in pre-loading culture.“People are coming into the city already drunk and even getting out of taxis holding bottles of wine and vodka and downing them before going into clubs.“Obviously when people are heavily drunk they are a danger to themselves and are more likely to get caught up in rows or fights.”
