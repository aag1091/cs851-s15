Saturday November 17, 1990 & both Jon Bon Jovi & Richie Sambora are on their first visit to Australia and appear here on the ABC Countdown Revolution 100th Show.We see a relatively small interview but then we hear these two performers right at the beginning of the ladder to their future fame as we would all know about today, but back then these two were riding the wave and it's good to see & remember these times in my opinion.The unplugged compilation is without equal in my eyes at least, we see the beautiful voices these two had in their natural prime and their guitar playing is totally first class, this is recorded in Dolby HD for your aural & visual pleasure!LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Regarding Copyright lawAny video from this channel may or may not at any time contain in full or multiple series of derivative works which are LEGAL under fair use law.The "Fair use" Provisions outlined in TITLE 17, Chapter 01 Article 107 of the U.S. Copyright law states the following:Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, INCLUDING SUCH USE BY REPRODUCTION IN COPIES or phonorecords or BY ANY OTHER MEANS specified by that section for purposes such as criticism,comment,news,reporting,teachin­g(including multiple copies for classroom use),scholarship or research, is NOT an infringment of copyright.
