So I finally got to complete this video for my dear patient friend Mary who had the highest bid for my video in the Club Doccubus auction and donated to SFTS.. I cant express how many times I had to start over this video because my software decided to be a baby but my generous and gracious faemily always so understanding I really hope you like this video I am a little late but I finished it :). She had one request to show her favorite scene so I hope you like the way it was blended with your awesome choice of music for Doccubus.Thanks for WatchingEditing done by: @Kay07mingWatch in HD :)I own no rights to the materials used its done purely for fun and to maybe put a smile on my LG Faemily faces.
