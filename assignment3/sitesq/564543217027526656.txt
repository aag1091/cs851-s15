KRS-One Upset With State of Hip-Hop: 'I Can't Make Money in America'KRS-One is an American rap legend who often had the distinction of "your favorite rapper's favorite rapper." He never made a huge impact on the charts, but his 1987 debut as part of Boogie Down Productions, Criminal Minded, is often credited as one of the greatest hip-hop achievements ever. But he is upset with the state of hip-hop in this country, saying, "I can't make money in America."The 49-year-old is currently having a tough time making money in America, so he often skips over to Switzerland when he wants to make dough off a show. He recently spoke with VladTV, via HipHopDX, about his current predicament and hip-hop's place in American culture."Our parents were on their hands and knees begging to be a part of America," KRS-One said. "We were never part of that, ever ... Blacks and Latinos get it the worst. We get it the worst in America. But the white people in America, too, started looking. And just a sense of justice. Was just like, 'Wait a minute, why is it like this if it should be like this?' And this is when hip-hop exploded. With Public Enemy who was representing Minster Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. And their whole audience was white kids."KRS rode that wave in the late 1980s and early '90s, but now finds himself an outcast in the market."You can tell that the government here [Switzerland] is lenient towards hip-hop, towards its elements," he said. "Breaking in the street, graffiti on the wall, people rapping. I can't make money in America. Why am I here? It's 2013, OK. Why is KRS in Switzerland and not in Ohio ... The political leadership of Ohio don't respect me."He does have respect, however, from rap heads. Check out his classic "Sound of Da Police" below:
