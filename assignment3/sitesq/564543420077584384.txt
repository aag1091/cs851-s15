Inspired by some of our favourite games like Wipeout, Trackmania, Vib-Ribbon and Audiosurf…Drive Any Track is a high octane music based racing game where we create racetracks from the songs in your music library.Action on track is synced to the audio, you literally have to race the music to stay in time and score points.You've seen other music powered games, DAT takes the concept to the next level with our innovative MEGA engine. Drive Any Track takes any song, analyses it down to its core components and creates a unique racing experience from it.Verses, choruses and drops become checkpoints, and the environment and cars are styled to the genre of music you're playing.Experiment with your music collection and find out which songs make the best racetracks!Be the first to 'create' a race-track from a song and have your name forever enshrined on the track’s leaderboard.Drive Any Track is currently in continuous development, with three genre styles already included (Dance, Rock, Urban), and a selection of unique cars and liveries (and some secret cars you have to work out how to unlock!)Further development will continue as we add more musicality, genre styles, cars, stunts and gameplay elements.
