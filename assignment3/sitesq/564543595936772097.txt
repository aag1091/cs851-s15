This report comes from a survey of 320 marketers from a cross-section of industries, company sizes and levels of social marketing experience. We heard from those leading the efforts at the C-level, those who manage as well as those who support the social marketing function within their organizations, and a number of business leaders who are helping to bridge the social gap within their enterprises.Furthermore, this report contains responses from organizations at various stages of social marketing program implementation. We got a balanced response from those starting out (self-reported novices and social media dabblers) and those who have gained a strong foothold with social marketing (self-reported experienced companies and social marketing leaders).
