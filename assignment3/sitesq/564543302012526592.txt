I sang a total of 12 songs on stage [for the tour]. If it was me in the past, that’s something I could never have imagined doing. Going on stage and being together with fans is a happy memory.” He also chose “Song for You (I’ll Sing)” from his latest album as the most memorable song, as it is a song just for his fans.In response to the question of his favorite song to sing when he’s not on stage, Lee Min Ho shared, “’That I Once Lived by Your Side’ [by Toy (Kim Yeon Woo)]. The lyrics are relatable and it’s a song that I’ve liked since a long time ago.”The interviewer also asked if there are differences amongst his fans from countries all over the world: “When I went overseas for ‘Boys Over Flowers’ in 2009, I felt each country’s distinct character. Now, I don’t feel a big difference. Now, I think I’m able to experience a special feeling when I see the fans’ expressions or eyes, which goes beyond language. I feel an overwhelming sense of emotion whenever that happens.”
