Carmouche vs Murphy Booked for UFC Fight Night in AprilLiz Carmouche vs Lauren Murphy is one of those fight announcements that leaves me saying, “but of course!” in a bad Disney-inspired French accent. The landscape. The records. The fight styles. It just makes sense. In this uber title shot focused dystopia that the UFC women’s bantamweight division currently exist in, the mainstream seems to forget that there’s a lot of other exciting matchups that can draw heat and interest.Yes, Liz is coming off some back-to-back flat decision losses. And, yes, Lauren left behind her Invicta 135 championship belt to be handed her first loss by a smothering Sara McMann. But that doesn’t extinguish the pure grit and talent that got those ladies to their #8 and #9 rankings in the division. I realize I’m investing a lot of time into explaining why you should be interested at all. Maybe you’re already on board and you know why this is an equally awesome and intriguing matchup.You know that both Liz and Lauren started their careers at the same time. They both don’t hail from traditional martial arts backgrounds. That they both rose through the ranks on a surprisingly fast trajectory fueled by heart, talent and just overall impressive cage awareness.This is one of those matchups that would most likely have taken place on an Invicta main card and earned Fight of the Night honors while simultaneously crashing a server. So good on Zuffa for booking it. Good on Liz and Lauren for agreeing. Good on you for knowing exactly where you need to be on April 4th.
