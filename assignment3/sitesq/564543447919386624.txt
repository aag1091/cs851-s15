MESOSCALE DISCUSSION 0060 NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK 0330 PM CST SUN FEB 08 2015 AREAS AFFECTED...NRN SAN JOAQUIN AND SACRAMENTO VALLEY CONCERNING...SEVERE POTENTIAL...WATCH POSSIBLE VALID 082130Z - 082300Z PROBABILITY OF WATCH ISSUANCE...40 PERCENT SUMMARY...IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL LATE THIS AFTERNOON WILL RISE TO A LEVEL THAT REQUIRES A WATCH...BUT AT LEAST SOME INCREASE IN SEVERE WEATHER PROBABILITIES APPEAR POSSIBLE BY THE 22-23Z TIME FRAME. DISCUSSION...GIVEN SUFFICIENT BOUNDARY LAYER INSTABILITY...VERTICAL SHEAR PROFILES ARE ALREADY SUPPORTIVE OF ORGANIZED SEVERE STORM DEVELOPMENT...INCLUDING SUPERCELLS...ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION. AND DEEP LAYER MEAN WIND FIELDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON...AS A 90-100+ KT 500 MB JET STREAK NOSES TOWARD THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. HOWEVER...AS OF 2130Z...THE POTENTIAL FOR APPRECIABLE BOUNDARY LAYER DESTABILIZATION REMAINS UNCLEAR. AN EVOLVING PRE-FRONTAL PRECIPITATION BAND...WITH EMBEDDED CONVECTION...CONTINUES TO RESTRICT SURFACE HEATING. AT THE SAME TIME...TEMPERATURES ALOFT...EVEN NEAR THE UPSTREAM MID-LEVEL COLD CORE...WHICH MAY NOT IMPACT THE INTERIOR VALLEYS UNTIL LATER THIS EVENING...DO NOT APPEAR ESPECIALLY COLD /MODELS SUGGEST -20 TO -22C AT 500 MB/. ON THE OTHER HAND...IT DOES APPEAR THAT BREAKS IN THE OVERCAST COULD ALLOW FOR AT LEAST SOME ADDITIONAL BOUNDARY LAYER WARMING THROUGH MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...COINCIDENT WITH AT LEAST WEAK MID-LEVEL COOLING. THE LEADING EDGE OF THE MID-LEVEL CLEAR SLOT IS IN THE PROCESS OF PROGRESSING INLAND ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COASTAL AREAS. AS THIS FEATURE ADVANCES EASTWARD INTO THE SACRAMENTO AND NORTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEYS THROUGH THE 22-00Z TIME FRAME...ASSOCIATED DRYING WILL CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING CONVECTIVE INSTABILITY...PROVIDING AT LEAST SOME POTENTIAL FOR INTENSIFYING STORM DEVELOPMENT. IT CURRENTLY APPEARS THAT STRONGEST STORM DEVELOPMENT COULD BECOME FOCUSED NEAR THE SACRAMENTO AND STOCKTON AREAS...PERHAPS INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF A TORNADO OR TWO...IN ADDITION TO THE RISK FOR LOCALLY STRONG SURFACE GUSTS AND SMALL TO MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL. ..KERR/HART.. 02/08/2015 ATTN...WFO...HNX...STO...MTR...
