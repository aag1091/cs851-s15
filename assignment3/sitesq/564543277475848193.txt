(Rick Wells, GOP The Daily Dose) -- Dr. Bill Warner of the Center for the Study of Political Islam put together a highly informative video and associated “dynamic battle map” which puts the early Islamic jihads and the ultimate response of Christians to their relentless attacks and oppression, the Crusades, into perspective.He recommends that anytime we meet someone who is an apologist for jihad, such as the current occupant of the White House, they should be confronted with the truth and he illustrates that truth in a very easy to understand and digest format in this short presentation.The map and presentation uses a database of 548 battles around the Mediterranean and Black Sea to contrast the aggression of the barbaric Muslims with the response of their civilized targets, largely Spain, France, Italy and Greece. Other regions such as Africa, India and Afghanistan are not part of the database, so the presentation is incomplete, but it does provide an excellent foundation for understanding who was the aggressor and who was justified in their actions.Since the seventh century and beyond, those who call Islam a religion of peace are being deceptive. They are often just the opposite, violent aggressors intent on world domination. That has been their goal since their inception and it remains their goal today.RedFlagNews.comWelcome to RedFlag News, a 100% independent news-aggregation website.
