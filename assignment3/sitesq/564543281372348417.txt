Limestone Organic Creamery is a family run operation consisting of Francis and Kathie Groenewegen and have been dairy farmers all of our lives. Twelve years ago they decided to transition to organic agriculture for a healthier, more meaningful way of life. The two children Patrick and Olivia have been working to process pasteurized, organic dairy products in the new creamery on the Certified Organic dairy farm on Sydenham Road. They do not use pesticides or herbicides. The milk is so fresh it will have traveled less than 1 food mile.Limestone Organic Creamery opened Spring 2012. They have a complete line of dairy products from Organic Meadow, a farmer owned co-op where they have been members for 10 years along with 5 other local farmers.Many other local and organic whole foods are available at the farm store and through the home delivery service.They are processing milk right on the farm - something Francis has been looking forward to since he began farming full time 40 years ago! Delivering milk will also a thrill as his father Case delivered milk in Holland in the thirties with horse and wagon. When Case would talk too long at a stop, his horse "Henny" would move on to the next house. After the last delivery, Case could nap because "Henny" knew the route and would take him right home.FAB & Limestone Organic Creamery would like to thank you because when you support local farmers, and eat organically in particular, you are doing many great things for our environment, from fewer chemicals in the water table to fewer food miles traveled and fossil fuels used. You are helping to encourage a new generation of farmers, to rebuild the local food system, and strengthen economic stability; all of which leads to the security of our food.
