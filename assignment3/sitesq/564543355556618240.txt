Truly Italy !!Being a non vegetarian, I find it quite a sacrifice to come to pure vegetarian restaurants. However, Little Italy's delicious fare makes me keep coming back for more.I was dazzled by their menu which is truly exhausting, come on 20 different types of pizza's and pasta's and desserts. My number would still be less. I had ordered for cheese fondue and French fries baked crust pizza. I couldn't wait to get started with the fondue once it arrived. It was perfect, to say the least. The cheese was mouth-melting and still gives me the desire to visit again just for that.The portions are incredibly generous, the pasta delicious. My favourite is the Puttanesca, even my Italian friend loved it and the pizzas were pretty nice as well. The ambience is a bit'kitty party' in the afternoons, but service
