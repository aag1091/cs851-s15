Elisabeth Moss steps out with a huge smile on her face on Thursday (April 2) in New York City.The 32-year-old actress spoke with HuffPost Live and said she would “totally” do a Mad Men spinoff.“I love Joan so much. And I love Peggy and Joan’s relationship, you know? I just think she’s one of the most incredibly brilliant actresses. It devastates me whenever I watch her… I would totally do [a spinoff],” Elisabeth said. “I most likely will [return to television] at some point. There’s so much great material out there, and I’ve been reading some really great stuff recently. It’s like you get these scripts and you’re like, ‘Oh man, it’s so good!’ [But] it takes away from something else. I do feel like “Mad Men” isn’t even dead and buried yet. There could be a spinoff, but it’s very much not up to me. But I think I’ll pause just a second and let people enjoy “Mad Men” before I do another TV thing.”Jenna Dewan-Tatum hit a Mercedes with her Range Rover and did the right thing by leaving a note on the car's windshield.
