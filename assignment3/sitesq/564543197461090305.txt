Spencer’s police chief, David O’Callaghan, learns this lesson the hard way when he orders Mac Faraday to stay away from the south end of Spencer’s mountaintop—even though he owns the property. It doesn’t take long for Mac to find out what lies on the other side of the stone wall and locked gate, on which hangs a sign warning visitors to Keep Out!Topping the list of the ten most haunted places in America, Astaire Castle is associated with two suicides, three mysterious disappearances, and four murders since it was built almost a century ago—and Mac Faraday owns it!In spite of David’s warning, Mac can’t resist unlocking the gate to see the castle that supposedly hasn’t seen a living soul since his late mother had ordered it closed up after the double homicide and disappearance of Damian Wagner, a world-famous master of horror novels.What starts out as a quick tour of a dusty old castle turns into another Mac Faraday adventure when Astaire Castle becomes the scene of even more murders. Mac is going to need to put all of his investigative talents to work to sort out this case that involves the strangest characters he has run into yet—including a wolf man. No, we’re not talking about Gnarly.__________________________________________________________________This is Lauren Carr’s first plunge into the world of the paranormal, and I must say, it’s absolutely thrilling! There is never a dull day in the life of retired investigator Mac Faraday, and finding out he owns a haunted castle piques his interest, regardless of what his friends tell him about leaving it well alone. And, with the investigation into the abandoned castle comes the appearance of a wolf man and the murder of two prominent celebrities, further stirring up the lore surrounding the disappearance of a horror author that once lived in the towers so long ago, creating many different avenues of adventure for both readers and characters alike. I love how seamlessly Carr is able to tie nearly everything together in the end, save the supernatural entities she evokes in this thriller, and as a paranormal and mystery lover, this novel is the perfect mix, providing enough evidence to explain away multiple happenings while leaving enough room for speculation for those a little more into the supernatural.Carr’s intense characters, Mac Faraday, David O’Callghan, Archie Monday, and Gnarly, take readers on another amazing crime scene adventure you won’t soon forget, just in time for Halloween. If you haven’t read any of the Mad Faraday mysteries and you’re looking for a novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then I highly suggest you start with this one as each Mac Faraday novel stands alone. And, once you start, you’ll want to read them all. Five stars.Acorn Book services has been extremely gracious in allowing me to read this novel, via Netgalley.
