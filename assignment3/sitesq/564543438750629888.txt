Why can&#8217;t this angel get a visa?Louis WhiteWhen Andrey Shirben left Australia with his family on September 27 last year for a short trip to Israel, little did he know five months later he would still be there and unsure when the federal Department of Immigration and Border Protection would let him back into the country.Meanwhile, the investment community in Australia, and many start-ups, are missing out on vital funds and advice from a well-respected investor."I've been an entrepreneur all my life, set up 10 of my own companies and in the past nine years I've been a full-time start-up investor and invested in over 50 companies," Shirben says from his current residence of Petah Tikva, in the centre of Tel Aviv.AdvertisementShirben, the founder of SYD Ventures, which invests in start-ups, has been living in Australia for four years with his wife and two children. He is keen to keep investing."I'm also currently putting together a follow-on fund that will be investing in Australia – if I get a visa, of course – China and Israel, addressing the gap between seed/angel funding and venture capital funding, writing cheques between $500,000 and $2 million to help companies grow and scale," he says.He flew out of the country with his family to celebrate the Jewish holidays, as well as meeting entrepreneurs and investors in his native country, with a planned return date to Australia of 1 November last year – two days before his visa expired.Due to an extraordinary run of family illnesses, Shirben flew to Thailand to look after a sick niece, meaning he had to submit his new visa application from the Thai Embassy in Bangkok, which was rejected."My previous visa had expired while we were overseas and we had a wrong bridging visa, so we applied for a temporary visa in order to get back in and sort out the bridging visa, but apparently this doesn't fit the protocol of the Department of Immigration," Shirben says."I re-applied for the visa after receiving some advice from Canberra but was refused again. I was very confused and contacted them again, and they in turn contacted Immigration, only this time got a different response, saying that they cannot approve us a temporary visitor/tourist visa and we need to apply for another working visa."Now, Shirben is in Israel confused as to what the next step is. The visa situation in Australia is complicated for people awaiting permanent residency, and even more so for the self-employed."A Bridging visa A preserves the same conditions, benefits and obligations of the expired visa, until such time as the new visa application is determined," Robert Jackson, principal of legal firm Aitken Partners, says."Any travel overseas will end the Bridging visa A, unless the applicant first obtained a Bridging visa B before travelling outside Australia. Otherwise, the applicant has no right to travel back to Australia, unless a new visa application is made, or hopefully the pending visa application is meanwhile approved."A Bridging visa B is a temporary visa allowing people to leave and return to Australia while the substantive visa is being assessed.Jackson, who has been through the visa process and who is also a migration agent, says the granting of a Bridging visa B is up to the discretion of the Department of Immigration."A Bridging visa B is typically granted for a period of weeks rather than months. The need to obtain a Bridging visa B is not always made clear by the Department of Immigration," he saysNot only is Shirben and his family suffering but so are many Australian businesses that could benefit from his knowledge and financial backing."Andrey Shirben was the first person who invested in our company," Rod Bishop, co-founder of car pool business Jayride, says. "That was the first investment Jayride ever took, and the first that I had ever raised. Andrey is great to work with, so we invited him to join the board of the company. Since then he's helped us whenever we need it, been instrumental in our further capital raisings, and the greater success of the business to date."Shirben has invested more than $100,000 in the business."The number one thing that every start-up business needs is advice from seasoned players," Bishop says. "Ideally those who have already hit their own home runs."When you get a person with Andrey's experience wanting to move to your country, to mentor your businesses, to invest in them – both his money and on behalf of a network of international investors – it's a no-brainer."It's the best thing for the start-up ecosystem, for the economy, and you should be doing everything you can to welcome him in."Shirben has not only been an active investor in the business start-up community in Australia but has also been active in the general community.He has been helping UNSW Australian Graduate School of Management with its executive MBA program, taking an active part in its "live venture" challenge, where the students have to analyse a start-up from the point of view of an investor and decide whether they want to "invest" in the company."Just this week I had to turn down the invitation to participate this year … simply due to the fact I'm not in the country," he says.Nicholas Gruen, chief executive of Lateral Economics and chairman of Peach Financial, Innovation Australia and the Australian Centre for Social Innovation, is dismayed by Shirben's situation."Pathetic, I'm afraid, though the Department of Immigration has form and indeed, in my experience, has done even worse on occasion," he says. "Regulators should try to administer their regulation so as to address any objectives it has – like keeping our country safe, and administering entry into the country in an efficient way – and should try to solve people's practical problems within that context. Alas, that's not what's been done here."Gruen has only praise for Shirben's contribution to Australia."I've known Andrey since he spoke at an investors' club that I'm in … and I have been sufficiently impressed with him that I've made an investment which is towards the higher end of my normal amount in an investment vehicle for start-ups he runs, which has so far been very successful."So what's the next step for Shirben?"Well, that's a good question," he says. "On one hand we have an outstanding permanent [visa] application that is in process for over 10 months now and the Department of Immigration refuses to provide us with any ETA on the decision making on our case."For now I [have had] to postpone all the meetings with Australian investors who are interested to invest in the new fund I'm building and unfortunately I have to turn down all the Australian entrepreneurs knocking on my door for advice, funding, consideration for board positions, as I simply can't meet them face-to-face."We've been offered a bunch of visa options, ranging from another working visa, which is a bit tough to follow, as I'm an investor and don't really work for anyone, all the way to significant investor visa, which I don't really qualify for, as all of my money is generally invested in start-ups, a highly illiquid investment."Besides that, all of these visas take months to process and cost often in excess of $10,000 and I generally prefer to invest the money in another start-up, rather than 'donating' it to the Department of Immigration."Comment was sought from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection about Shirben's situation. The department had not responded at time of publication.
