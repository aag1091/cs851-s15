Healthy Report.coNFL Wants To Ban Supplement Being Used By Professional AthletesShred Body Fat. Add Lean Muscle. The man pictured above is the perfect example of what this unknown supplement, Ultimate Muscle is capable of, and why supplement retailers want it off the market.The secret that supplement retailers don’t want you to know. The NCAA and Major League Sports have been lobbying law makers to ban a new supplement, called “Ultimate Muscle.”The NFL’s main argument centers around a claim that the results are too “steroid-like,” even though the product has shown to have no negative side effects from several clinical trials ran by several independent doctors. The NBA and the MLB have also joined the NFL in this campaign.Ultimate Muscle manufacturers have responded by mocking the sporting world by offering free trials of the product to the mass public until or until supplies run out. They are confident that once people try their product, the results will be so amazing that they will not want to try anything else.CommentsJohn DerinHave been taking this supplement for around a week and have been seeing amazing gains!
