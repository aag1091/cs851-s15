Hi B Boys and B Girls! Thanks for watching MattyB's parody of Carly Rae Jepsen's hit song, "Call Me Maybe!" He recently had to chance to meet Cimorelli on the beach and... well... this is what happened! He made some true friends! They are extremely sweet and talented but he's realized that teenage girls are crazy and must be approached with caution! :) Be sure to check them out on YouTube and subscribe to their channel too for great music!
