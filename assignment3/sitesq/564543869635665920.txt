Galvanized Souls™ On Good Morning TexasAfter a show at the Whisky A Go Go celebrating 51 years of live music on the Sunset Strip with L.A. Guns on January 16, 2015, Galvanized Souls took off to Dallas, Texas to record some new songs for an upcoming EP with Casey Di Iorio of Valve Studios. During the production, the band was invited to perform live on Good Morning Texas on ABC’s WFAA Channel 8. Live news reporter, Brian Glenn, arranged for the band to be on the show. Since the band was not accustomed to the two hour time change, getting up so early to be in the studio was a bit of a challenge for them but nevertheless they were all so super excited for the opportunity.The band decided to perform their original “Behind Green Eyes” live on air because they love the way this song flows acoustically. The sound engineer who was handling the live sound surprised the guys by recounting things he knew about the band after admitted he watched several of their webisodes. He pointed to Matt and Chris and said “hash browns” which is one of their favorite foods.The band found it interesting that the interview questions included the words “Y’all” in one of the questions.Here is a webisode about the experience of being on Good Morning Texas:This is the actual segment that was aired on ABC’s Good Morning Texas:
