Recently, Mayweather posted a video on Instagram of their meeting and highlighted a moment when Money told Pac-Man point-blank, "before we leave the sport, of course, we have to make this fight happen.‚ÄùAt 47-0, Floyd probably wants to hit the 50-fight mark before calling it quits. So, with only three bouts remaining, Mayweather could very well make Pacquiao the last or second-to-last fight of his career. Let's hope both guys can get on the same page for the sake of the sport and their respective fans.
