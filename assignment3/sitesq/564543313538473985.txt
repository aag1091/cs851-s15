Life At The Helm of the Half Doz...Follow Me!The Things We (I) Said TodayI appreciate my husband- he works hard and rocks!- but sometimes the fact that he works most nights as well as days can make home life exhausting (aka tedious, draining, etc.). Usually, I’m totally thankful to be able to be home with our kids. Yesterday, thought, was one of those days- you know the kind all too well.I totally envied his escape into the “outside world”. Henceforth, my actual email to The Captain on Friday:I have no doubt that you are dealing with your own share of s–t at work today- in a metaphorical sense, of course- so I hope you’re hanging in there. I myself have my own share of s–t to deal with today; well, not MY own, exactly, but that of our dear #6, who felt the need to open his diaper & scatter its contents throughout his crib.TWICE.community.babycenter.comSo though your day is surely full of challenges, I’ve compiled a list of phrases I’ve been forced to utter today- most more than once- so that when you get home and ask me how my day was, I don’t have to make this face:Share this:CommentsYes, yes indeed. None of the Minions are currently nudists, but Cubby has an obsession with the tub at the moment. "QUIT DANCING IN THE TUB!" is something I've said over the past few days, repeatedly. WHY the child insists on climbing into an empty tub and tap dancing is beyond me.I love your blog and following on bloglovin'! I found you at Creative Bloggers network. You should definitely check out my potty-training page. I have and English degree as well, but not a masters. Blogging is the first time it has been used, if that even counts! lolLOL, I only have 3 children but I use most of these phrases daily as well. I mean, why can’t they keep their clothes on, wash their hands for real and SIT during dinner….!?! Gotta love those little maniacs!
