People have been asking about our freeroll Leaderboard so here is what you need to know:Basically, you report your results to us after every PokerSites freeroll in February, along with your PokerStars name. At the end of the month those people with the highest scores on the Leaderboard will have a chance to win some of our fabulous PokerSites swag, custom made just for you. Good luck and have a winning month! http://goo.gl/rM1KNA
