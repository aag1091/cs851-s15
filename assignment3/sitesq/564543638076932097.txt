My older son has autism, and life is a constant challenge. But having a child with a disability has taught us to appreciate simple pleasures of life, like catching raindrops with a tongue or having whole five minutes uninterrupted to have a cup of tea, enjoying the world where the smell and taste and all things sensory become more acute. Cooking for me is a labour of love and a creative process as well as a form of an escapism.
