Justin Bieber wants to be a better personLos Angeles, Feb 7: Singer Justin Bieber says he is “passionate” about being a “better” person and wants people to remember that he is only a “human”.The “Believe” hitmaker recently made a video for fans in which he apologised for his recent conduct — which has included wild partying, driving offences and throwing eggs at a neighbour’s house — and he wants people to realise he is only “human” and gets upset by criticism, reports femalefirst.co.uk.Speaking on the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” Thursday, he told the host: “People often forget that, even with their comments and stuff, they think it doesn’t get to me. But it gets to me. Things that people say bother me and I gotta be strong enough to just keep it pushing. That’s why I just wanted to make a video to just let people know that I’m human.“I love people. I love love. I’m passionate about things and I’m passionate about being better and growing, so I think that this is going to be an awesome chapter in my life and I’m so glad that I have you guys supporting me.”The 20-year-old singer’s appearance on the show is just over a week after he made the video and he admits he was feeling anxious about people’s attitude towards him.“It was the first time I was on television for a long time, and I just was worried about what people were thinking about me. Like I said last time, I did a lot of things over the past few years that I’m not proud of.“I was just nervous to be in front of people again and talk in front of them. Remember,” he added.Asked why he went on to make the video, he said: “I thought I just looked really extra nervous and I kinda just wanted to explain myself.”
