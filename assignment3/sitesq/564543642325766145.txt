I've been making Clash Of Clans/YouTube videos for under a year as a way of me expressing myself to the YouTube community & I enjoy it so much. Doing these videos for everyone to watch is hobby as well as a passion for me, I don't care ho much time & effort I put in becasue the feedback I get from everyone is enough for me.I really appreciate all of you's giving up your time to watch my videos and if it's not to much to ask, it would really mean a lot if you could hit that like button and show some positive feedback down in the comments.Also if you want to get to know me more or just get in touch I'll be leaving my social media links as well as the link to the MCN I'm partnered with known as freedom, they have great offers such as a no lock in contact, so you're free to leave when you see fit.The only requirements freedom has is that you don't have any copyright strikes and 10 subscribers.Clash of Clans is an addictive mixture of strategic planning and competitive fast-paced combats. Raise an army of Barbarians, War WIZARDS, Dragons and other mighty fighters. Join a clan of players and rise through the ranks, or create your own Clan to contest ownership of the Realm. Driving back the goblins is just the first step - your quest isn't over until your clan reigns supreme over all others!
