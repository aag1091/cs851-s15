The Frenchman now has a 13-3 record at this ATP World Tour 250 indoor hard-court tournament, having previously lifted the trophy in 2013 (d. Paire). He finished runner-up to Gael Monfils in last year’s final, but avenged that loss with victory over his countryman in Saturday’s semi-finals.Gasquet was crowned champion when Jerzy Janowicz was forced to retire ill just three games into the final. The fourth seed had won 14 straight points to open up a 3-0, 30/0 lead before Janowicz conceded."I knew he was sick when we were warming up. I saw very quickly at the beginning of the match that he couldn’t play at all," said Gasquet. "Anything can happen, so even though I knew he was sick, I stayed focused. I had a great week, with solid matches. It’s good for the rest of the season. I felt that I played well this week. I feel 100 per cent and ready for the season.""I'm extremely disappointed because I felt pretty OK the whole week," said Janowicz. "I saved six match points in the first round and after that I played pretty good tennis. Two days ago, I got sick. I haven't slept in almost two days. I had a fever and the flu and I'm so weak. There was not much that I could do today."Former World No. 7 Gasquet lifted his 11th ATP World Tour trophy and first since 2013, when he won three titles for the second time in his career (also 2006) with victories at Doha, Montpellier and Moscow. He has a 10-12 record in finals.Watch Final HighlightsPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoThe 28-year-old Gasquet has opened his 2015 campaign with an 8-2 record, reaching the quarter-finals in Doha (l. to Berdych) before reaching the third round at the Australian Open (l. to Anderson).
