Borno Government to revoke road contracts handled by lazy contractorsSubscribe to Daily Post NewsletterBorno State Government (BOSG) has vowed that henceforth any roads and drainage contractsii at a ‘snail speed’ in the state will be revoked.This was disclosed yesterday by the Commissioner for Works, Hon. Usman Zannah while inspecting some ongoing roads and drainage networks in Maiduguri, the state capital.Although, the Commissioner expressed satisfaction with the level of work at Bulumkutu – Tsallake, Maduganari wards undertaken by EEC, and CGC construction companies as well as construction of roads and drainages in Mairi, London Ciki, Dikwa Low-Cost among others under direct labour, he also promised to effect all outstanding payments.Zannah who visited Lagos street under construction since inception of governor Kashim Shettima in 2011 was disappointed with the level of work on the busy road contracted to HIJIAG Nigeria LTD at a total cost of N3.4 billion, insisting that there is no willingness to complete the project by the company, hence, he warned that, if HIJIAG failed to comply with the new directive, the contract should be revoked, even as he told the contractor to report to his office within one week.It would be recalled that the Lagos street dualization project which is one of the busiest roads in the metropolis was contracted to HIJIAG by the present adminstration and more than three years now, it remained stagnant without reaching 50% completion and with no hope of completion before the end of Shettima’s first tenure.But reacting, the Project Manager, Engineer Par Kingson lamented that due to insecurity posed by insurgents, HIJIAG Nigeria ltd encountered difficulties in importing some materials needed, particularly for the completion of the main bridge linking Gwange general area, but promised to do their best to complete the project.However, the Commissioner drew the attention of the project site Manager, saying “emphasis should be given to Lagos street in view of its importance to the people living in Maiduguri, as all eyes are on the project”.
