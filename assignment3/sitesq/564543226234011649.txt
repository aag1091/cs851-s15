This scriptural presentation is intended to expose the lies spewed from the pulpit concerning the "rapture" doctrine. The Lord is against the rapture heresy and many will be cast in outer darkness when the true CHRIST returns because they will be guilty of spiritual prostitution with the devil himself. Those who teach this false doctrine will be held accountable for their own deception and the deception they caused others. The LORD in Ezekiel 13: 16-20 said " I Am against those who teach my children to FLY and block the outstretched saving knuckles of my hands." Rapture preachers are against the will of GOD.
