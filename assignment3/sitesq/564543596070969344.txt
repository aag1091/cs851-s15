So If It's "Faux News," Why Is Fox Beating The Pants Off The Other Networks?The left may call it "faux" news, but 2015 rang in some impressive ratings. And 1.748 million primetime Fox viewers can't be wrong. Compare that to MSNBC's 169,000 primetime viewers. And obviously MSNBC has stolen a few CNN fans â€” thanks to coverage of the Ferguson riots.Sure, if you watch Fox News you might be accused of drinking right wing Koolaid. Or being a filthy rich Republican. Or a kook. Or a Nazi. But that's a small price to pay for getting news with less liberal bias. This network is so popular because it appeals to ordinary, everyday conservatives who are worried about this nation run amuck. And it features stories the other networks just won't touch.
