Watch This!‘Star Wars’ Drone, ‘Saved By the Bell’ Reunion, and More Viral VideosFrom a Star Wars themed drone to a Saved By the Bell Reunion skit, watch our countdown of this week’s buzziest videos.5.

Train Plows Through SnowbankNo, it’s not a scene from Snowpiercer, but it looks like it could be. A videographer captured a Canadian train plowing through a snowbank that formed on the tracks in Salisbury, New Brunswick. Add your own dramatic music for the full effect.3. ‘90s Kids Commercial Gets WeirdIf you were a kid in the ‘90s, it’s likely that you’ll remember that almost every commercial for toys, breakfast cereals, or juice boxes was a giant wad of frenetic editing, flashy colors, and quasi-surrealist plotting.

Flirting with Your Office CrushEven if your company’s HR policy permits office relationships, broaching the subject with the object of your affection can be a challenge in and of itself. Fast Company offers this look at how you act around your office crush versus how you think you act around them. (Spoiler: you’re not playing it as cool as you think.)1.
