Mom’s Famous Crockpot Baked BeansBoy oh boy do I have a special treat for you guys today. My mom recently came up for a visit. Being the social butterfly that she is, Mom had several gatherings to attend while she was in town.Do you want to know what they all requested her to make? Yep, you’ve got it! Her FAMOUS baked beans. These baked beans are seriously the best.Mom usually makes her beans in the oven, but it takes 5 hours and I really dislike heating up my house in the summer. So I set out to replicate her beautiful beans in the crockpot. Guess what? I DID IT! Whoop whoop!Mom’s Famous Crockpot Baked BeansIngredients- 3 cans (15.5 oz) pinto beans (you can also use regular pork n beans, but to make this vegetarian friendly, use pinto)- 1 & 1/4 cup brown sugar- 1 & 1/2 teaspoon Coleman’s dry mustard- 1.5 cups ketchupDirections1. Start by mixing together brown sugar and dry mustard. Mix until well combinedI halved this recipe when I made it so that I wouldn’t have to many leftovers and baked it in a 3 qt. crockpot. It turned out good but the ketchup flavor was really strong, so next time I’m going to use half the amount called for. I really like how simple this recipe is!We made these yesterday, and they were so delicious, I wanted to stop by and thank you for sharing the recipe! Our carnivore and vegetarian friends alike really enjoyed them and so did we.We started with dried pinto beans (3 cups), and reserved enough of the cooking liquid to approximate the amount that would be in the cans, and followed the rest of the recipe as written. That probably saved us a couple of dollars over using canned beans.
