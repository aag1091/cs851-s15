How we can start to fix our transit messResidents of metro Detroit communities that have opted out of SMART service must demand that their elected officials opt back in, for the good of the region.(Photo: 2011 photo by MANDI WRIGHT/Detroit Free Press)Buy PhotoThe story of James Robertson's 21-mile commute is at once inspiring and infuriating. His dedication, day after day, year after year, to walk the distances buses don't run shows the incredible lengths some people will go to keep a job. The many people who opened their hearts and wallets to help him show how caring and giving people truly are.Yet, the fact that he needs to make such a trek shows the infuriating failure of our region's leaders to provide a basic public service: buses for Robertson and others like him.Each one of these entities should take this story to heart and take prompt action to fix these transit gaps, for Robertson and the thousands of people like him.Believe me, he is not alone. Many people undertake Herculean efforts just to get around our community. Many more miss out on jobs and other opportunities because getting around is so difficult.Transit problems do not have quick or easy solutions. Yet they can and must be solved:■ The Rochester Hills City Council should put funding for SMART bus service on the ballot so residents can choose whether to fill this huge gap in transit service. Other communities that don't provide SMART bus service should do the same.■ The Oakland County Commission should work with SMART to provide a county-wide transit system, like Macomb does, without huge gaps in service.■ SMART should restore all-day service into Detroit so people like Robertson can get home.■ Detroit should provide DDOT with the money it needs to restore 24-hour service, so second-shift workers like Robertson can get home.■ The Michigan Legislature should allocate additional funds to transit across Michigan.■ And statewide, voters should approve the May 5 transportation ballot measure to raise the sales tax to provide more funds for roads, buses and other public services.None of these solutions is easy, and none of these solutions will solve the transit crisis alone. Yet, with dedicated attention by our region's leaders, these transit problems can be solved, for Robertson and thousands of others.Yes, we should all be inspired by Robertson's commitment and dedication and by the generosity of people who donated to help him.But we should also be infuriated that this was ever necessary in the first place.Join me in demanding that our region's policy-makers take real leadership and fix the transit crisis that has festered for far too long.Within 60 days, our region's leaders should create a concrete plan of specific actions they will take to close the gaps in our transit system. It's time to fix our region's transit for all of the James Robertsons in our communities.Megan Owens is executive director of Transportation Riders United (TRU), a nonprofit group dedicated to improving transit throughout the metro Detroit region.
