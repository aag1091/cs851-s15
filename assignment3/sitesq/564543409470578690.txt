Top 50: Best Multicultural Children’s BooksJune 23, 2011Best Multicultural Books Every Child Should ReadEvery summer I stress out about what picture and chapter books to get for my kids that they will like but are also exposing them — as only books can do — to the wide world all around them both past, present and future.This summer, we are going to take a trip around the world by reading these multicultural books. What is great about this list is that it covers all the ages of my kids: from preschool through elementary school.I will be sneaky and check out these books for them and leave them strewn about the house for them to examine when they are bored. I will keep you posted on what books my kids actually liked because that is a whole ‘nother list! See you at the library!I wanted to add “Everyone Cooks Rice” and “Chicken Sunday”. Also we have been enjoying “The Kite”, a book about a boy in Nicaragua (or other Central American country, it doesn’t specify) who works in the market and whose mama is about to have a baby, and whose father died, who yearns for a kite from the toy stall at the market.Nice list! Don’t forget titles by classic award winning Asian American authors like Alan Say’s titles which are numerous and Yoshiko Uchida’s “the Bracelet” a good read that is a rare historical fiction for young readers which opens up a discussion about true life events surrounding the Asian American experience of the “relocation” camps that forcefully extracted 120,000 persons including children from their homes, schools and jobs only because of their race. Children need books like these to open their eyes to recognizing how to respect one another in a society that often lauds self-promotion, marginalization and disrespect for persons who are different in any way from the majority.Hi Evelyn, Thanks for your great book recommendations. I love multicultural books for kids too and I agree with you that it’s so important to expose children to different cultures through books.Pragmatic Mom recently posted…20 Books About Poland For KidsThis list is INCREDIBLE!!!!!
