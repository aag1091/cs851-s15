Never forget her name.”Henry Louis Gates Jr.One of Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s most memorable moments from his PBS show “Finding Your Roots” came with U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia.On March 7, 1965, Lewis was one of the notable civil rights leaders who led more than 600 people on a peaceful march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma toward Montgomery, Alabama, advocating for the right to vote. As portrayed in the recent film “Selma,” Alabama state troopers interrupted the marchers with violence, and Lewis was among those badly beaten.In researching Lewis’ family tree during the first season of “Finding Your Roots,” Gates found that the first thing Lewis' great-great-grandfather Tobias Carter did in 1865 when set free from slavery by the 13th Amendment was register to vote.“You can’t make this stuff up,” Gates said. “We found this incredible document, and I showed it to Congressman Lewis. When he looked up, I said, ‘John, no one in your whole line has voted between your great-great-grandfather and you.’ He looked at me, blinked, then his head fell over and hit the book, and he wept. He wiped his eye and said, ‘I guess it’s in my DNA, this right to vote.’ Then he said, ‘This is too much.’“(Genealogy) is like taking them on a time machine and you are introducing them to their ancestors,” Gates said. “I used to think only black people had what I call ‘genealogical amnesia,’ but it’s not true. Everybody does.”In commemoration of Black History Month, the Deseret News interviewed Gates, professional genealogist Megan Smolenyak and family historian Prince Furlow about their experiences with African-American family history work. Gates and Smolenyak also shared advice and resource tips for building one’s family tree, which can become all-consuming.“Once you get started, it might become addicting,” Gates said.'I have been hooked'In addition to his PBS show, Gates is the director of the Hutchins Center for African-American Research at Harvard University. He’s a literary scholar, filmmaker, journalist and genealogist, among many other professional pursuits, honors and accolades.Gates said his interest in genealogy started at age 9 with the death of his grandfather, Edward St. Lawrence Gates. He recalls his father taking his hand and leading him to his grandfather's body in a Maryland funeral home.“I was petrified,” Gates said. “It was the closest I’d ever been to a corpse. He was as white as white can be. He looked like a marble statue. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out how someone who was so phenotypically Euro-American could have a grandson that looked like me (African-American). I was fascinated by that.”Next, his father took Gates and his brother to his grandparents' bedroom, where he pulled out a scrapbook. The old bank ledger was full of news clippings and photos. His father turned the pages until he found an obituary dated Jan. 6, 1888, which included a photo. The obituary began, “Jane Gates, an estimable colored woman."That same photo of Jane Gates now hangs in the kitchen of Gates’ Massachusetts home.“My father said, ‘I don’t want you boys to forget, this is the oldest Gates, and she was a slave,'” Gates said. “'Never forget her name.'”The next day was the Fourth of July. On the way home, Gates asked his father to buy him a composition book. That night, he interviewed his parents about their ancestors and compiled his family tree.
