Like this item?These blue translucent butterfly wings measures approximately 1"x 1,5 " (not including the earring hooks). The wings are iridescent and their color changes from blue to purple. They are made by myself from start to finish and covered with several layers of crystal clear resin. I use a specific method to put texture and gradient colors to make them look like real. I do use real flowers for my jewelry but not real animals for sure. I love nature and I am trying to capture a part of it without doing any harm. This could be a great gift for any Nature lovers.It might be observed variations of the colors and resin imperfection since everything is done by hand. This is a stock image, your earrings might slightly differ from the picture.
