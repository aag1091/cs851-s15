The 10 councils named and shamed for paying staff less than Living WageIs your council one of the ones paying workers less than the Living Wage?Ten councils with the highest number of workers paid less than the Living Wage in England and Wales have been ‘named and shamed’ in a bid to raise Town Hall pay.Three of the ten are in the more prosperous South East, but across Britain more than one in five (21.7%) jobs are paying less than the Living Wage of £7.85 an hour and £9.15 in London.The GMB union used official government statistics to reveal the true extent of the problem and warned that no area of the country is immune from the “low pay epidemic.”The union has launched a new Town Hall pay campaign to get all councils committed to paying the Living Wage, which is above the National Minimum Wage of £6.50 an hour and is considered the rate necessary for a modest, but acceptable standard of living.So far 134 out of 375 local authorities in England and Wales have implemented the Living Wage, up from 103 a year ago. In Scotland, all 32 local authorities have signed up.The ten councils in England and Wales with the largest proportion of jobs paying less than the Living Wage in 2014 were:West Somerset (42.9%)Harrow (41.1%)Torridge in Devon (38.6%)West Lancashire (38.3%)Waltham Forest (38.2%)Breckland in Norfolk (38.0%)West Devon (37.3%)North Norfolk (36.5%)North East Derbyshire (36.3%)Woking (35.9%)On a regional level, the East Midlands has the largest proportion of jobs paying less than the Living Wage (24.7%, or 1 in 4 jobs) in England and Wales, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber (24.3%), the West Midlands (24.1%), Wales (23.9%), the North West (23.6%), North East (23.4%), South West (22.6%), East of England (22.3%), London (18.3%) and the South East (17.8% or about 1 in 6 jobs).Women and part-time workers are disproportionately affected: 26.6% of jobs held by women and 42.3% of part-time jobs are below the Living Wage.Brian Strutton, GMB national secretary, said:“No area is immune from the low-pay epidemic which is why all local authorities need to champion the Living Wage in their communities, beginning with their own staff and contractors.“There are 446,300 council employees paid less than the Living Wage, the majority of them women working part-time.“The Living Wage matters because it takes into account the income that people need for a minimum acceptable standard of living. It is a first step towards a rate of pay that people can live on without relying on benefits.“Life below the Living Wage is a life of want and worry for millions of workers and their families, but Town halls can’t solve the low-pay problem on their own and some in the worst-hit areas are already signed up to the Living Wage.”One of the key recommendations of last year’s All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into hunger in the UK was for councils to pay the Living Wage and use their buying strategies to encourage local businesses to do the same.Town Halls have been imposing below inflation pay rises on staff after having their budgets slashed by the Tory-led Coalition.The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says that savings of £2.5bn will need to be found from council budgets for 2015/16 and warned the “future of our local services like libraries, youth centres and care for the elderly face a huge financial challenge.”
