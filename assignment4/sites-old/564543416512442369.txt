Click on a question to see our answer:Why are some objects not on view?The Museumâ€™s permanent collections are very large and only a fraction of these can be on exhibition at any given time. Sometimes works are lent to other museums for special exhibitions; sometimes they are in the conservation laboratory for study or maintenance. Certain types of objects, such as watercolors, textiles, and photographs, are sensitive to light and begin to fade if they are exposed for too long, so their exhibition time is limited. Finally, as large as the Museum is, there is not enough room to display everything in the collections. In order to present our best works, collections are rotated periodically.How do I find out how much an object in the Brooklyn Museum collections is worth?The Museum does not disclose the monetary values of objects in its collections.I own a similar object. Can you tell me more about it?Please submit via e-mail a photograph of the object you own and as much information about it as you can, and we will provide any additional information we are able to find. Please note that research in our files is a lengthy process, and you may not have a response for some time.How would I go about lending or gifting a work to the Museum or seeing if the Museum is interested in purchasing a work that I own?Please submit via e-mail a photograph of the object you would like us to consider, as well as all of the information you have about it, and your offer will be forwarded to the appropriate curator. The Brooklyn Museum collections are very rich, and we have many works that are not currently on exhibition; because of this, and because storage space is limited, we are very selective about adding works. However, the collection has become what it is today through the generosity of the public, and we continue to be grateful for this generosity, which can still lead to exciting new acquisitions.How can I get a reproduction of a work in your collection?How can I show my work to someone at the Museum or be considered for an exhibition?Why do many objects not have photographs and/or complete descriptions?The Museum's collection is very large, and we are constantly in the process of adding photographs and descriptions to works that do not currently have them, or replacing photographs that have deteriorated beyond use and descriptions that are minimal or out of date. This is a long and expensive process that takes time.How can I find a conservator or get advice on how to treat my artwork?
