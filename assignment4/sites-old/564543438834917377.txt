For #Share1Love, the Bob Marley family has teamed up with a cool, new social video platform called Videoo. Videoo limits clips to 33-seconds based on the premise that it's long enough to cover the material, but short enough to keep it interesting. We're hoping that you'll watch lots of clips and get inspired.What types of videos can I upload?
