Aitape, New Guinea. 8 February 1945. The versatile jeep, once more proves it is invaluable. New use is found for it, in this 'transportable' machine-shop. The jeep is driven to any given position, where it's engine drives a built-in generator, which in turn supplies current for, (all built-in) lathe, electric drill, grindstone and hone, battery charger, and a complete lighting plant. Here Craftsman Ron Green of Melbourne, Vic, is operating the lathe. Note the logo shows the crocodile under the palm tree over a boomerang.
