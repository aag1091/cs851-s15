in chat and it will report the calculation to you.[13:26:50] Jim Tarber: calc 5+(20/4)[13:48:18] 5+(20/4) = 10The many viewer-end chat commands are all listed on the Preferences form under Advanced->CmdLine1 and Advanced->CmdLine2.Also the server-side chat commands. These have been described before but here is much more detail, and a full list:Normally a '/' followed by a number sends a text message to any objects listening on the corresponding channel. So "/1resync" might say a "resync" on chat channel 1. If you use this but specify a "!" instead of a number, the server intercepts it and processes it as a server command. There are 3 server-side commands ("/!find", "/!nuke" and "/!show"), although it's more like 5:/!find <object>This is in some ways like the Area Search found in many viewers, however it is considerably more powerful. For one thing, it's not only objects known to the viewer, but any object know to the server managing the region where you typed this command. Also, unlike Area Search, there's no distance limit. You can be standing on the ground and search for what happened to that fireworks object you were scripting, and find it at 8765m above you. Also, it supports reporting up to 100 matches, well beyond the 16 nearby items supported by Area Search.You can specify the ID of a specify object, or any portion of the name:Note that there are two IDs for any in-world object: the local ID (the normal-looking long number) and the UUID or key (the hexadecimal number with dashes). You can use either to specify an object, so once you found the one you were interested in, you could continue to track that specific one in the future by specifying the ID, e.g.:/!find 1156168123[12:54:12] System: Object 1156168123 [203f4c83-2eca-4872-9002-c67516f54326] 'New Sound Test' at Test1 (248,157,21)/!find 203f4c83-2eca-4872-9002-c67516f54326[12:54:47] System: Object 1156168123 [203f4c83-2eca-4872-9002-c67516f54326] 'New Sound Test' at Test1 (248,157,21)/!nuke <object>Nuking an object works just like /!find, except that you must indicate a specific object, therefore it does not support identifying the object by name. You must specify either of the IDs. A nuke is a forced delete of the object (it has the usual delete/return permissions checks). e.g./!nuke 1156168123After a short delay:[13:58:51] Server: Your object New Sound Test was returned from <248.986, 157.3004, 21.02122> in region Test1 due to parcel owner return/!show updatesThis command lists the objects generating the most updates. Updates need to be sent to all viewers in that region and neighboring regions (depending on draw distance). Thus, they generate bandwidth usage on the network, which slows everything else that needs to be sent if there are a large number of objects generating too many updates. These can be full updates, the smaller terse (position) updates, or a weighted total which is just a combined score where full updates cost twice as much as a terse update. If no additional parameter is specified on the command, it takes a new 5-second sample and shows a nice sorted summary of the objects producing the most updates.This is a key tool that we use for tracking down problems in regions. Since this is a 5-second sample, single- and double-digit values aren't really any kind of problem even if it's the highest score in the region. A value of 50 means 10 updates per second (which is fine for something like a moving animal or guided tour object, etc). It's if that number is up in the hundreds that I'd be more concerned about an object generating too many updates. A second form of the command skips the 5-second sample and just dumps the current totals:This is far less useful because the numbers will be larger for objects that have been in the region the longest, and the longer the region has been running, the larger these numbers will be, however[13:14:42] Jim Tarber: /!show updates total[13:14:42] System: ********** GROUP UPDATE COUNTS (TOP 10 BY WEIGHT) **********Name Location WeightedTot Terse FullTest Vehicle <0, 53.41849, 20> 73470 73462 4Test Vehicle <0, 255.8839, 20> 55075 55067 4Chatworldz HUD 0.86 <250.3738, 36.82337, 21.3555> 118 0 59Mass Test <225.602, 0.4710674, 0.5005> 60 52 4As you can see above, I've been testing crossings a lot and the two test vehicle objects have sent a large number of updates in total. However, if I left off the "total" parameter on "/!show updates", the scores would be all zeros since the vehicles are not moving, and generating no updates./!show offsimThis is a historical command that used to be important but no longer really provides much value except to confirm all is well. It lists any objects that do not have positions within the 0<=position<256 range. Since that should not be possible anymore, and since any such existing objects are "fixed" when a region is restarted, everyone should see this:[13:26:50] Jim Tarber: /!show offsim[13:26:50] System: 0 off-sim objects found:Who is onlineUsers browsing this forum: No registered users and 2 guestsYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot post attachments in this forum
