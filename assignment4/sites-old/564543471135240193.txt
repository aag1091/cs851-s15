The Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park—a 19th century railroad bridge transformed into the world’s longest linear park—hosts a weekend full of running memories in New York State’s beautiful Mid-Hudson Valley. Runners of all abilities are invited to take part in one of three flat, fast and scenic races – a marathon, half-marathon, and a 5K—each of which traverses the historic Hudson River via this 1.25-mile pedestrian bridge . Participants will be wowed by tree-lined landscape as they go the distance along the William R. Steinhaus Dutchess Rail Trail, the Hudson Valley Rail Trail in Ulster County, and the riverside campus of Poughkeepsie’s Marist College. But the jaw-dropping views of the majestic Hudson from atop the 212-foot Walkway will make these races truly unforgettable.2015 RegistrationClick here to reserve your spot in the inaugural Walkway Marathon, Half Marathon, or Mid-Hudson Road Runners Treetops to Rooftops 5K, all of which take place on Saturday, June 13, 2015.
