Oklahoma GOP Rep Proposes Bill To Make It Illegal To Prosecute Elected OfficialsOklahoma State Representative Kevin Calvey (R) proposed a bill which would prohibit district attorneys from prosecuting state elected officials, legislators, district court and appellate judges, and appointees to state commissions for public crimes, Ring Of Fire Radio reports.Calvey says he filed the bill because he is outraged over the “malicious prosecution” in Texas of former Gov. Rick Perry, not because of events in Oklahoma.DAs are obviously upset.“It’s a big deal to me. I’m upset and concerned,” said Oklahoma County DA David Prater. “This bill creates a different class of citizens that would be protected from the normal prosecution process.”Prater wondered whether or not the bill is “retaliation” for his prosecution of state legislators, a judge, and members of the Pardon and Parole Board.Perry was indicted in August by a grand jury in Travis County, a Democratic stronghold in the largely Republican state. Handling the case is a special prosecutor who was once chosen to be a U.S. attorney in Texas by President Barack Obama.Calvey, an Oklahoma City Republican, said he doesn’t want such a situation to occur in Oklahoma.“The origin of it has nothing to do with anything that’s occurred in Oklahoma. It’s my concern over what’s going on in Texas with this witch hunt by a local prosecutor,” Calvey said.He said he doesn’t think any of the current district attorneys in Oklahoma would do something “so outrageous.”“But who knows who will get elected to those offices in the future?” he said. “I do think it’s just better to prevent that kind of thing from ever arising. … The point is to not allow a locally elected official to effectively have undue influence over statewide policy.”This just stinks of arrogance. Lawmakers are not above the law. In fact, they should be held to a higher standard.I think bloggers should be exempt from prosecution. Yes, I can sound like an arrogant arsehole, too.
