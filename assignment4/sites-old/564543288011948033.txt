Fifth graders at Etiwanda Colony Elementary have been hard at work, producing a newscast. E.C.B. News is scheduled to air for the entire school in a couple of weeks.Just like at Eyewitness News, these kids have their own studio with anchors, a camera operator, director and stage manager. Twenty-four students make up the Etiwanda Colony Broadcast News Team.Alana Okonkwo is one of the video editors."It's really cool to see all of the film together and see this is what we made and this is what we created," Okonkwo said. "I would totally want to be in the news one day."The students meet, divide the shooting responsibilities and decide what stories they plan to cover on their own time and during recess. The one thing the entire group has learned, they say, is the importance of teamwork."We have to work together to get the job done," said student Angelita Mangaser.Their teacher, Kathryn Kooyman, loves the enthusiasm the kids show."If you can embrace that thing that they're really good on and inspire them to go for it, they truly can be successful in life," Kooyman said."What gets me excited is that it helps me follow my dreams of becoming a field reporter, cameraman or whatever I want to be," said student Kyle Palumbo.
