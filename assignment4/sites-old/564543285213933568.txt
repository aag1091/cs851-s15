Hearing ScreeningsThe Department of Wellness and the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders have partnered to provide FREE hearing screenings to all OSU-STW benefits-eligible employees. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing-Association, it is recommended that adults have their hearing screened at least every decade through age 50 and at 3-year intervals thereafter. Screenings will be administered from 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. on Friday, February 20 in Murray Hall 042. A certified and licensed speech-language pathologist will be on site to supervise screenings, and results will be available instantly.The screening is free, but you MUST schedule an appointment. To schedule your appointment, please email Tabi Deal at tabi.deal@okstate.edu. Appointments are available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
