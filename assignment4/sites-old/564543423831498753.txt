SynopsisOne of the last films made by Jeremy Sykes before his death in the Antarctic in a helicopter accident, this NFU short commemorates the 1969 Cook bicentennial. It traces Cook’s first voyage to New Zealand and his charting of the coastline. Contemporary illustrations and dramatic camerawork are used to follow his six-month journey around Aotearoa. It also highlights Cook's navigational skills as he sailed the Endeavour, home to 94 men, two greyhounds and a goat, through uncharted waters, helping earn him his reputation as "explorer extraordinary and servant of the King".QuotesWherever he went he was scrupulously fair and on this coast he understood that he was the stranger and the Māoris were the rightful owners of the land. At no time would he allow his men the luxury of exploiting them.– Narrator Peter GwynneThis morning I was awakened by the singing of birds ashore. The numbers of them were certainly very great. The seemed to strain their voices with emulation perhaps. Their voices were certainly the most melodious music I have ever heard, almost imitating small bells but with the most tuneable silver sound imaginable.– Joseph BanksThis tall, dour Yorkshireman had for years quietly distinguished himself in the eyes of the Admiralty and their Lordships trusted him to succeed where many would fail.– Peter GwynneWhen he landed to become the first European to stand on Tasman’s New Zealand, the danger was real. The result: two natives dead and three captured.
