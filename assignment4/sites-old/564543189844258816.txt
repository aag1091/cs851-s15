#1On Wednesday, December 10, 2014 the arrest of Floyd “money” Mayweather may have been undertaken by authorities for the drug related murder of Rapper Earl Hayes and VH1 star Stephanie Moseley. Associates in Mayweathers’ organization have indicated off-the-record that, yes, Floyd Mayweather was in fact under arrest. This disclosure comes just days after rapper Earl Hayes shot and killed his wife, VH1 star Stephanie Moseley, in the bathtub and then turned the gun on himself.There was so much weed in the house where a rapper shot his famous wife Monday in a murder-suicide, it required an armed guard to protect the stash as it was taken to a police lab.
