U of T Student and Toronto Chapters of Canadian Society for Civil Engineering team up to host a panel discussion with Human Resource representatives of leading construction and engineering firms. On this video two speakers are interviewed behind the scenes to provide their hints on what recruiters are looking for: what to do (and not to do!) when trying to get hired. This event was an informative and entertaining insight into job searches and recruitment.
