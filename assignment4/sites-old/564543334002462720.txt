Watch WindowIn large worksheets, it is especially useful to be able to view a cell that contains summary data, such as totals. This can become tedious if your totals are at the end of your worksheet, while the data you’re editing is at the beginning, causing you to have to scroll down to be able to see the totals.If you use Excel’s Watch Window, you can keep your worksheet’s summary data in view while no matter where you are editing within the worksheet.To do this in Excel 2002 or 2003, right click the cell you want to watch, and select “Add Watch” from the list. The window that appears will give you information about the cell, such as the workbook and worksheet it is located in, it’s cell reference, the value in the cell as well as the formula that is in the cell. If you wish to watch several cells, simply repeat the above steps for each cell you wish to watch. You then can drag this window to any edge of the spreadsheet to “dock” it in place, as you would any other toolbar.If you’re using Excel 2007, you can still do this, except you can’t simply right click the cell as you would in 2002 or 2003. In Excel 2007, select the cells you wish to watch, go to the Formula tab on the ribbon and select Watch Window. In the Watch Window, click “Add Watch”.Deleting a cell from the Watch Window is just as easy. Simply select the cell from the Watch Window and click “Delete Watch”.
