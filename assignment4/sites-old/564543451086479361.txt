The forthcoming Elemis TSV is the 5 Piece Skin Lift Collection which consists of 5 (funny that) products alongside a cosmetic case to store it all in. It’s also the launching pad for the newest Elemis product, the Pro-Intense Lift Effect Day Cream, meaning whoever gets involved wit the TSV will be some of the first people to try the product. The other four products are Pro-Radiance Cream Cleanser, Pro-Intense Eye and LipContour Cream, Pro-Intense Lift Effect Night Cream and the Gentle Rose Exfoliator.The set is worth over £200 but as it’s a QVC TSV it’ll come with mega savings and should be less than £65 for the whole set which launches on QVC on 1st February 2015 – so this coming Sunday. I’ve got one set to giveaway, so follow the Rafflecopter info below to get involved. Good luck!Stay up to dateHello and thank you for visiting my Beauty Geek blog.
