Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said that the Republican strategy for fighting President Obama’s amnesty orders was developed by GOP leadership and “designed to lose.”“Let’s be clear, the cromnibus was leadership’s plan. I said at the time it is a bad plan and it is a plan that is designed to lose,” Cruz replied when CNN’s Dana Bash suggested that he was leading the Republican party into a fight they can’t win. Immigration hawks wanted Republicans to try to block implementation of Obama’s executive orders on amnesty during the lame-duck session, but House Speaker John Boehner — at the behest of incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), partly — opposed that tactic and instead negotiated to have the votes needed to pass the spending package that funded most of government through the end of the fiscal year, but left the Department of Homeland Security on a short-term continuing resolution.Cruz reminded Bash that seven Senate Democrats claimed to oppose Obama’s executive orders on immigration during the 2014 midterms, but they are now filibustering the bill that would block funding for the legislation.“They told their constituents they didn’t support the president ignoring federal law, ignoring the constitution and unilaterally and illegally granting amnesty to four to 5 million people here illegally,” he said. “I think we need to tee it up and give those Senate Democrats an opportunity to go on record to demonstrate whether they were telling the truth when they were talking to the voters back home or whether they’ll just stand with President Obama instead.”
