Moments after performing with Big Sean at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on Saturday night, Kanye West gave an aspiring rapper a chance to spit some lyrics. As he was exiting the venue, Kanye was asked by a rapper named Cameron Grey if he could rap for him. Kanye agreed and Cameron dropped a freestyle before Yeezy requested him to perform a written verse.With Justin Bieber in the background watching, Kanye asked Grey if he’d be open to start as an assistant first, which lead to the two exchanging contacts and handshakes before ‘Ye left. Last spring, Kanye took the time to listen to another aspiring rapper’s lyrics before entering his New York City apartment.
