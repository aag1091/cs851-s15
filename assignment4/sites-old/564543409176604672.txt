Check out this judgmental map of NYCIn March, Untapped Cities posted a Judgmental Map of Manhattan by Joe Larson that poked fun at the city’s “small dogs” and “trust-fund hippies.” Now Larson is back with a more extensive snark-filled map that includes Brooklyn and Queens. Find your ‘hood after the jump.How about the staff writers at the Real Deal learn how to spell the word “judgmental?” It is not spelled “judgemental.” Goddamn this magazine.BHyes, yes, indeed goddamn TRD.They do not believe in proofreadingWilla LewisIt’s optional. British or American spellings are okay. You show your ignorance. Pull out a (real) dictionary.DR.FUNKHilarious.DennisGreat!!!!!!iseedeadpeopleseems pretty accurateJohn-PaulI’m pretty sure the person who made this map hasn’t spent much time traveling around the NYC metropolitan area – especially relating to the NJ side. Way to just reiterate dated stereotypes and pretend like you’re adding to the conversation.
