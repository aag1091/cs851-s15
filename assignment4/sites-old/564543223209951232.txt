The Cataracts widened their series lead to 2-0 today with a win over the Clarenville Caribous at the Joe Byrne Arena.The game was close for 60 minutes, with the Cats holding a 3-2 edge when the buzzer signaled the end of the third period.The Caribous “gave a strong effort,” said Lukinchuk, comparing today’s result to the Cats Saturday night win of 7-1 against their bitter rivals.“We’re always prepared for a seven-game series, but at the same time we want to take it one game at a time and not get too far ahead of ourselves,” said Lukinchuk.The Cats opened the scoring to Sunday’s game early in the first only to fall behind by the end of the first period with the Bous quickly answering to the Cats’ offensive and finishing the first frame up 2-1.The remainder of the scoring belonged to the Cats, with top-line player Andre Gill scoring the tying and eventual game-wining goal 24 seconds apart early in the second period.The teams played scoreless for the final 36 minutes.Colin Circelli assisted on both of Gill’s markers.Ryan Graham and Brad Crann replied for the losing Bous.The series continues next weekend in Clarenville with games three and four.
