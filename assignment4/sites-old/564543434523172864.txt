Why Do Magazines Lighten Black Faces?Kerry Washington, InStyle, March 2015The Scandal actress's visibly lightened skin was down, said InStyle, to the lighting used on its shoot. The magazine said: "While we did not digitally lighten Kerry's skin tone, our cover lighting has likely contributed to this concern. We understand that this has resulted in disappointment and hurt. We are listening, and the feedback has been valuable. We are committed to ensuring that this experience has a positive influence on the ways in which we present all women going forward." Washington tweeted, neutrally, it was an "important conversation" to be had. However, even if it was down to lighting, the magazine surely knows the effect of lighting on subjects of all skin colors and tones, and must have known the effect of lighting Washington in the way it did. Which makes its "explanation" oddly even more damning.
