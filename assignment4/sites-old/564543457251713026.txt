Sir Martin Sorrell, one of David Cameron’s closest corporate allies, says the business community faces “a conundrum” in choosing between Labour and the Conservatives at the ballot box in May.As more former business backers of Labour distanced themselves from the party this weekend, Sorrell, chief executive of the marketing and advertising group WPP, said the uncertain future of Britain in Europe under the Tories was of deep concern to many firms investing in the country.In an interview with the Guardian, Sorrell said the decision about which party to vote for amounted to “Hobson’s choice”; on the one hand, he claimed, Labour was “anti-business”, on the other, a Conservative victory would trigger a referendum on Britain’s EU membership.“From an electoral point of view Ed Miliband clearly believes bashing business is good for the ballot box and will benefit him. It’s a conundrum for business. Labour won’t have a referendum but you might have a regime that is more negative to business, and a referendum makes a Conservative vote that much more difficult,” Sorrell said.The comments follow a week of attacks directed at Miliband for the party’s relationship with business, which began with the head of Alliance Boots, Stefano Pessina, saying it would be a catastrophe if Labour were elected. Former supporters have turned on the party, including Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone Warehouse, who said he would be frightened by a Labour victory. Katja Hall, deputy director general of the CBI, agreed with Sorrell that it was unclear which result would be better for business: “We have some concerns about Labour intervening in the banking and energy sectors, but we are encouraged by their work on industrial strategy and reforming the UK education system to produce more rounded and grounded young people. We like the Conservatives’ emphasis on maintaining a competitive corporation tax environment, but have concerns around some of the unhelpful rhetoric on immigration.”Labour has struggled to attract the public support of senior business figures, as policies such as an energy-price freeze, mansion tax, and the reinstatement of a 50p top rate of tax, ruffle feathers in UK boardrooms.However, the shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, became the latest senior party figure to insist that Labour backed business. He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that Labour was a “furiously, passionately, aggressively pro-business” party.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet office minister, told BBC 5 Live that a referendum on UK membership of the EU, promised by the Tories before the end of 2017, was the “last thing” businesses needed because of the uncertainty.The prime minister tried to maintain the momentum of the attack on Labour, writing in the Sunday Telegraph: “This chaos [within Labour] betrays something much deeper about Ed Miliband and Labour – something that should strike fear in every family in the country: they have a sneering hatred of business.”Three more former business allies of Labour distanced themselves from Miliband this weekend.The Sunday Times reported that Chris Wright, founder of the music publishing firm Chrysalis, who backed Labour in the 2005 election, said the party risked stoking the politics of envy.Lord Haskins, a former party donor who ran Northern Foods, said Miliband had failed to capitalise on his party’s pro-European stance with entrepreneurs, and Robert Senior, head of the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, which ran Labour’s 2010 election campaign, told the Sunday Telegraph that Labour was “a very different beast” now and his firm would focus on other work.George Osborne and Miliband clashed on Sunday over Labour’s plans to tackle tax havens, the chancellor claiming a blacklist could isolate Britain from allies in Washington, Paris and Berlin.Labour has pledged to compile a public register of offshore firms and their owners if it wins the general election in May. A Miliband-led government would draw up sanctions against overseas territories not drawing up a list, a spokesman for his party has said.On the Andrew Marr Show, Osborne said such a policy would cause the British government to fall out with the US, France and Germany, which have no commitment to setting up a public register.Miliband’s office hit back, saying Osborne’s claims were “the lamest excuse for inaction yet”. His spokesman said: “No one is saying Germany, the US or France, is a tax haven and it is ridiculous to use this as a reason not to act on overseas territories and crown dependencies, which have operated under a shroud of secrecy for too long.”The effort by Labour to harness public anger over tax havens is a potential embarrassment for Cameron who has made no headway since he requested in 2013 that the islands draw up a public registry of companies’ ultimate owners.
