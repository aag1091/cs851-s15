Indulge in some childhood magic and allow me to create a book just for you! With a LARGE collection of Golden Books available, you can rest assured you will be able to choose a title you treasured as a child. Golden Journals are perfect for personal use or for gifting. Baby showers, birthdays and new school year stationery are the perfect excuse to nourish your organizational skills.These Golden Journals are an upcycled book in used or like-new condition! For added authenticity I leave the original name on the inside cover, but will highlight if an item is brand new (no crayon or pen artistry within the book).Lined Notebooks are fantastic for journaling, school work, to-do lists, jotting down childhood milestones and recipes. Keep letters to Santa, drawings and happy memories in one place. The notebooks are blue lined and 200+ pages. The full story is included, and a keepsake pocket can also be added for business cards, loose notes and photographs.Blank Books have proven to be very effective in aiding young children on the ASD spectrum to communicate and process their feelings through artwork or writing. Keep one handy in your bag as a sketch book or as a quick reminder.Yearly week to two page diaries are available.Nitty Gritty â€“ Every single Golden Journal includes the entirety of the original story, interspersed throughout the book. It is bound by hand using twin wire coil, and all efforts are made to ensure the book lays flat whilst open. The book measures to A5 sizing (approx. 6" x 8")
