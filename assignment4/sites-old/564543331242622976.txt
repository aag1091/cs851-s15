Follow by EmailFriday, February 6, 2015Enter to Win A Sea-Faring Romance By MaryLu TyndallI wrote throughout high school and even sent queries to publishers. But then I took a break. I didn't get serious about writing and publishing again until the Spring of 2010. That Spring, I started writing a historical Christian romance set in Ancient Rome, For Life or Until. It isn't published yet, but I learned a lot writing it. Anyway, to aid me in writing that book, I began devouring every historical inspirational romance in sight. The librarians at our Alabama military base were on a first name basis with me. One of the authors I discovered during that time period was MaryLu Tyndall. So imagine my surprise when I met MaryLu Tyndall on an online authors' group. I'm honored to introduce MaryLu Tyndall's latest sea-faring novel, Tears of the Sea, below.

The ripples from this tale left me truly stirred and inspired.
