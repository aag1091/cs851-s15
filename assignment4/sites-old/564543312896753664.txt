PAGE OF HAPPINESS .............Elena Tejada-Herrera is an interdisciplinary artist whose work facilitates publicÂ´s creative participation. She creates environments for the realization of creative collective aesthetic experiences. For this she makes available the means of different art disciplines and incorporates other non artistic practices into the artwork as well. These means been paint, drawing, video, sculpting materials and techniques and the combination of these among others. ."...I see my practice as cultural exchanges, where the conversations and interactions for the creative experiences feed the artwork. The resulting objects or materialization for the communication of these creative processes are photographs, installations, paintings, drawing, videos and Internet postings."
