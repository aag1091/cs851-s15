While some of the more daring Brit labels were not present on any of this evenings attendees, plenty of the more classic labels were represented including Stella McCartney and Jenny Packham.The faithful black dress - as seen this evening on Rosamund Pike who wore a Roland Mouret design, may be an enduringly stylish option but generally doesn’t make much of an impact in such glamorous settings.A bolder approach was taken by Amy Adams who opted for an icy white dress by Lanvin, always a great contrast on the red carpet. Another hit from the Brit designer came in the form of Reese Witherspoon who brought a much-needed pop of colour in a bright purple gown also by Stella McCartney.Of course the great British weather is not generally as kind as the Californian’s enjoy, meaning many stars including Witherspoon made their arrival with a coat, much-need in practical terms but never a good addition to a black tie gown.For Keira Knightley this took the form of a leather jacket, effortlessly teamed with a Giambattista Valli haute couture ruffled midi dress.
