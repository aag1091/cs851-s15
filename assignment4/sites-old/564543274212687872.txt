The shoes are just out of this world spectacular. They are most definitely not anything you will ever see pounding the pavements or twirling the dancefloor. Every page offers new inspiration and its not surprising when the author is Jane Weitzman, wife of Stuart Weitzman, the American shoe designer. I really wanted to reach out and touch the shoes, as creepy as that sounds but it is something you will completely understand when you open the book. Expect to see the very best in fashion and fantasy in a beautifully crafted book for shoe lovers all over the world.
