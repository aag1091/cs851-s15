In this excerpt of Barack Obama’s conversation with Ezra Klein and Matthew Yglesias, the president gives his perspective on why the economy has become so good for corporations even as it’s become so bad for their workers.Only one response to all who find what the president says as bull shit, or who say he has no ideas or plans, what exactly has the Gop done? The fact they hey have control of both houses for a month now and all they have done is vote to repeal ACA for the 59th time, without having any plan to replace it, gives a new definition to incompetence.Why does it seem like everyone is under some misguided notion that the president has control over "everything". He has to make due with what he can and who he works with. Let us not forget, there are THREE branches to government; one in particular has caused more problems than it has solved!Are we admiring the video or the content?? The graphics and music was great, the blamer in chief was at his usual position of "not my fault that the rich is getting richer and the middle class is in the crapper"
