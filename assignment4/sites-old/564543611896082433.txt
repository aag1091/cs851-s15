Dream LoverSiriAdd ContactTextPics / Vids"Yep, it's me -- Siri! You may recognize me from "Loveline" with Dr. Drew, or even from the horror film "Ooga Booga." But right now I'm here to have some fun. Did you know that my name Siri means "Beautiful Victory" in Old Norse? It comes from my Scandinavian roots. Text me and you'll learn all kinds of things about me â€¦ I may even text you back some pics if you're nice. Contact me soon!"
