Living in upstate Rochester New York gives me the opportunity to make a vast assortment of seasonal images from spring, summer, autumn and winter.I have also captured images from Alaska, St Thomas, Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas, West Virginia and Florida that would look beautiful hanging on your wall and the walls of hospitals, doctors offices, waiting rooms, restaurants, country clubs and everywhere there is a need for interior design.
