As you look around this room tonightSettle in your seats and dim the lightsDo you want my blood, do you want my tearsWhat do you wantWhat do you want from meShould I sing until I can't sing any morePlay these strings until my fingers are rawYou're so hard to pleaseWhat do you want from meDo you think that I know something you don't knowWhat do you want from meIf I don't promise you the answers would you goWhat do you want from meShould I stand out in the rainDo you want me to take a daisy chain for youI'm not the one you needWhat do you want from meYou can have anything you wantYou can drift, you can dream, even walk on waterAnything you wantYou can own everything you seeSell your soul for complete controlIs that really what you needYou can lose yourself this nightSee inside there is nothing to hideTurn and face the lightWhat do you want from me
