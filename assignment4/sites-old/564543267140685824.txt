There is only the danceuntil the swan dies.~ Bauke Kamstra.This blog began with this poem and this exchange – Is death the swan’s only song? – between Bauke (@Wyrde ) and me. Then my new Twitter friend from Australia, @TP_Hogan, chimed in about swansand triggered thoughts on that country’s black swans leading me to dust off and burnish some musings from my archives.r.§ § §THE BLACK SWANThe human opportunity is to turn flashes of insight into abiding light. ~ Huston SmithEvery now and then an unexpected and inexplicable event or product comes along that changes life as we have known it. Labeled by some as a Black Swan such a random incident, occurring in history, science, finance, technology and the arts, transforms society.Totally surprised by the arrival of a black swan, society is substantially altered. Afterward, when it cannot remember or conceive itself without the experience of that event or product, society finds a way of explaining and re-inventing itself around this necessary and inevitable arrival of a new defining pinion point.The personal computer, the internet and the iPhone are black swan examples in technology. It is interesting that Steve Jobs, known for his seeming ability to come up at will with repeated black swancreations such as the Macintosh computer, the iPod, iPad and iPhone, was not an inventor. He was only an assembler and integrator of existing technology and talent to produce society altering products. Steve simply had a different and black swandesign for the standard issue of “Lego” pieces we all get on arrival.Beyond his personal story and challenges Steve Jobs was somehow able first to engage, then maintain, an inspired vision of the finished product as the active template which attracted, ordered and assembled diverse bits of talent and technology into the structure and profound impact of yet another black swan creation.ARRIVAL OF THE BLACK SWANThe oldest known reference to the black swan term comes from Juvenal, a Latin poet, writing 1900 years ago alluding to something that did not exist. Juvenal’s expression became a common pejorative in 16th century London where all known swans were white.In 1697 Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh discovered black swans in Western Australia, upending a social certainty and a tidy expression of that “truth”. A little over a century later the clear thinking John Stuart Mill re-defined the black swan expression as an example of logical fallacy. What once was an equation of certainty has become a maxim for the folly and unreliability of prematurely declaring the absolute certainty of a matter that is still in play in an expanding universe not unlike a sportscaster who would presume to announce the winning team after only the first inning of a baseball game.In much the same way that we find it easier to deify a Christ than to enjoin the invitation to live the miraculous, society today largely protests that one like Steve Jobs is gifted beyond the average person and we remain largely unaware that the black swan potential is simply human essence embracing opportunity, not individual talent. This opportunity exists for any and every one of us who hears in a moment the angels sing then sets about unwaveringly to reorder their life’s priorities around that distant sound. Such a resonant knowing if held and joined by like minds is inevitably manifested into a benefit for all, even if common understanding dismisses such a vision to be as remote as idea of a black swan was in 16th century London.Of course, upon fulfillment of this vision all rejection is simply reworked to gospel as society reorganizes itself around the gift of this new way of life.That is my inner knowing and expectation; that’s why I see the future as bright.From the black where white swans singShining spreads on darkened wing.What black swan bright spots for the future do you “know” about?Share this:Like this:LikeLoading...RelatedAbout Börje MelinBorje Melin Canada Sweden USA Advocate, Researcher Local Fuel & Food Systems, Wellness Researcher, Carpenter, Government Consultant, Writer, Social Media Developer, Hiker, Farmer, Photographer Follow me on Twitter as @BorjeMelin In 1982 working as a major industry headhunter and financial consultant I had a disturbing and transformational encounter with my immediate future. I saw the world on fire, economically and environmentally, leaving people desperate for survival. Within weeks I permanently left all that was familiar and plunged into international travel/residence and countless promising business pursuits in search of an adequate response for myself, my family, my immediate and my extended community to this troubling vision. Thirty years later, and still en route, I am finding my way in #socialmedia and self publishing to gain a leveraged voice and new like minded friends to discover and embrace practical and genuine solutions that at minimum require a radical restructuring of all inherited social institutions and reformulation for first stage economic and ecological survival then welcome of an inevitable universal prosperity and well-being.
