Secretary of State John Kerry addressed world leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany earlier this morning.Kerry spoke about the fight against violent extremism, but there was a certain word nowhere to be found in his speech: Islamic."The second major test facing the United States, Europe and indeed the entire civilized world today is, of course, the rise of violent extremism," Kerry said. "Today, we are witnessing nothing more than a form of criminal anarchy, criminal anarchy, a nihilism which illegitimately claims an ideological and religious foundation.""And against this enemy, make no mistake, we are increasingly organizing and fighting back effectively, and we must. The world cannot and will not cower in the face of this extremism."Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, with the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, said on "Fox and Friends Weekend" this morning that if you want moderate Muslims to take ownership over the problem of violent extremism, you must call it what it is and admit its basis is in Islam.Civil rights attorney Shayan Elahi disagreed, saying that if you bash the Islamic faith and put out "false information," it will just marginalize and alienate 1.7 billion Muslims around the world.Jasser asserted that Elahi's "denial and obfuscation" causes an inability to address the ideology and actually get to the root of the problem.Watch the fiery debate above and let us know what you think about Kerry's refusal to mention the word "Islamic" in his speech in the comments.
