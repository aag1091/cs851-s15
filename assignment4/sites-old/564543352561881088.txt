Our participant's abilities range from new non-skaters to those on their way to becoming great hockey players.Players on the Ice Pirates gain a sense of fairplay friendship, and an amazing sense of accomplishment as they improve their hockey skills. As part of this unique team they improve their fine and gross motor skills as well as their understanding of acceptable social behaviour. Regardless of their ability on the ice, they all love coming to the rink, making new friends and participating in this great game of hockey!If you are interested and want more information please contact Kirsten Carr at [email protected] .
