The Arab World Is Furious With Porn Star Mia Khalifa For Becoming PornHub’s #1 SuperstarLebanese-born Mia Khalifa had the recent honour of becoming PornHub’s #1 most-searched porn star after just three months in the industry. As you might expect, this has ruffled a few feathers in the Arab world.The Lebanese Examiner wrote:Natives… upset and offended by her work, especially because she often boasts her Lebanese heritage on Twitter and Instagram, posting photographs of her Arabic tattoo that reads ‘Koullouna lil-watan, lil-oula lil-‘alam (the opening line of the Lebanese national anthem).She also has another tattoo of the infamous Lebanese Forces cross on her wrist. When questioned about it, she replied “I was born and raised there, I’m entitled to an opinion on the politics just like everyone else.It’s good to see her firing back on Twitter though:Doesn't the Middle East have more important things to worry about besides me? How about finding a president? Or containing ISIS?Come on, Lebanon. Get with the times. Mia Khalifa is breaking records and putting you guys on the map and this is how you repay her? Mia Khalifa and her porn films should be bringing us all together, not tearing us apart.P.S. How many of these dudes are religiously beating off to her videos and then hating themselves for it afterwards? Haram indeed.
