Reasoning behind my rating of only 4 stars is because of a glitch ... I don't earn points for posting to Instagram. Go through the whole shebang and it manages to disconnect from the app. After I have posted and click to be done to be brought back to this app... That's when I have noticed that I have to go back manually to the app ... And then it's still on the screen "crop and post to.." So who knows.... I'll update if anything changes because I intend to continue and LOVE it.Fun way to get mPointsby DalegourdSimple facts and lots of points. Some are things I wouldn't have guessed and some are pretty common. The reason for not giving a 5 is due to lack of new content. You see the same facts over and over again. But worth it to get the points.I really enjoy this app!by Summer Lynn83I have always loved to learn new and different facts, this app allows me to do just that. I also like the fact that you can earn mPOINTS. If I had one request it would be: More facts please!
