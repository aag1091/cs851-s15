Share this articleIt is worrying for country in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January and the hostage situation at a kosher supermarket that followed.Lunel's jihadists allegedly attend a Mosque in the town's suburbs, which the government has described as a 'hotbed of fundamentalism'.The Mosque is split between the more fanatically religious followers and opponents of the resident imam, who preaches in Arabic.A local man who prays at the Mosque said: 'I told him to his face that we couldn't understand a word he said, and that we wanted a French imam. He told us that, in that case, we should pray in a room outside the Mosque.'Some of the worshippers allegedly meet to discuss the suffering caused by the Syrian civil war and encourage people to go there.A local councillor Philippe Moissonnier said: 'These groups operate like a sect... And sects manipulate people. Once you're out there, it's easy to get you to take up arms. They turn sheep into lions.'
