OpenSOCObjectiveThe OpenSOC project is a collaborative open source development project dedicated to providing an extensible and scalable advanced security analytics tool. It has strong foundations in the Apache Hadoop Framework and values collaboration for high-quality community-based open source development.The OpenSOC project has the following goals:To provide a collaborative open source community for development of an extensible and scalable advanced security analytics toolTo encourage open communication for additional features and identification of deficiencies for a stable and functionally usable toolThe OpenSOC project welcomes participation from all people and organizations for development, enhancements, and/or implementation support.What is OpenSOC?OpenSOC is a Big Data security analytics framework designed to consume and monitor network traffic and machine exhaust data of a data center. OpenSOC is extensible and is designed to work at a massive scale.The framework provides the following capabilities:Extensible spouts and parsers for attaching OpenSOC to monitor any telemetry sourceExtensible enrichment framework for any telemetry streamAnomaly detection and real-time rules-based alerts for any telemetry streamHadoop-backed storage for telemetry stream with a customizable retention timeOpenSOC is designed to scale up to consume millions of messages per second, enrich them, run them through anomaly detection algorithms, and issue real-time alerts.What do I need to run OpenSOC2 Network Capture Cards (Recommend Napatech NT20E2-CAP)Apache Flume 1.4.0 +Apache Kafka 0.8.1+Apache Storm 0.9 +Apache Hadoop 2.x (any distribution)Apache Hive 12 + (13 recommended)Apache Hbase 0.94+Elastic Search 1.1 +MySQL 5.6+ComponentsOpenSOC consists of the following repositoriesOpenSOC-Streaming:This repository contains topologies for processing, enriching, indexing, and corelating telemetry messages, PCAP reconstruction service, and various other data services.
