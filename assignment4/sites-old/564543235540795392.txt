He can definitely play in more than one position.”Rooney does indeed get more of the ball in midfield, averaging 83 touches in the centre of the park to 65 as a forward this season, but is Van Gaal detracting from the 29-year-old’s goal-scoring threat?In 11 Premier League appearances in midfield this season, Rooney has scored three times and made one assist. Up front, in nine games as a striker, he has scored five times and made three assists.Similarly, Rooney has unleashed more shots (26 to 17) and hit the target more often (eight to five) in a more advanced role, although he has created 18 chances from midfield to 11 as a forward.Rooney has long been praised for his adaptability and has represented his country in a range of positions, including left midfield.However, it seems Jamie Carragher’s major frustration with Rooney’s current position, is that the two strikers ahead of him are not combining effectively - "there is not enough movement from the front two, there’s no sprint, spark or energy," he said after the West Ham game - and he believes Rooney should at least be deployed in a No 10 role.“The two strikers today had fewer touches than David de Gea,” said Carragher. “Rooney has got to get back up front, that’s his best position, or, in this system, you’d want him behind the front two.”Whether Van Gaal will be change his mind on the matter remains to be seen.“I have come across such exceptional players before,” the United boss said this week. “Edgar Davids was an extreme left-winger and I made him a midfielder. Michael Reiziger was a No 10 who became a full-back and Frank Rijkaard was a No 6 who played as a centre-half in my winning team at Ajax."I always look at the qualities of the player and decide where he can perform better for himself.”
