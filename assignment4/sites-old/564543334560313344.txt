Former Labour councillor jailed for election fraudA former Labour party councillor was jailed for three years and seven months yesterday for rigging postal votes in a local council election.Muhammed Hussain, 61, arranged for the collection of blank ballot papers posted to homes in the ward where he was standing in Blackburn, Lancashire.Campaigners went house to house asking voters to hand over blank ballots, telling them: "Don't worry, we'll take care of them."He went on to beat the sitting Tory candidate at the local elections of May 2002.Hussain pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to conspiring to defraud the returning officer in the Bastwell ward of Blackburn.Passing sentence at Preston crown court, Judge Peter Openshaw called it a "public scandal" and told Hussain he was passing a stiff sentence to set an example to others.He added: "In my judgment, public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process is a foundation of our democratic system. Those who fraudulently interfere are committing a most grave offence against the body politic."I consider it to be my public duty to make it a stiff sentence intended to discourage others from yielding to similar temptation."In the May 2002 elections, Hussain stood as a Labour candidate under new postal voting rules which gave everyone the right to vote by post.Electors were sent ballot papers and a "declaration of identity" to confirm they had the right to vote, which had to be signed in the presence of and by a witness.Hussain overturned the Tory majority and was elected by 1,728 votes to 1,043. But after the election, a police investigation was launched when it was noticed there had been an irregularly high return of postal votes from Hussain's ward - 1,538, 9% higher than in other wards.Police contacted a number of postal voters and discovered that Hussain's supporters had collected blank ballot papers and the declaration of identity form. Then they filled in the forms, selecting the Labour candidate and signing as a witness. In all, officers found 233 fraudulent votes cast for Hussain.Mark Ainsworth, prosecuting, said: "In essence there was a system in place for a large number of postal votes to be collected from households before they were fully completed. They were then completed so as to indicate a vote in favour of Hussain, then submitted in the election."Hussain moved to Britain from Pakistan in 1961 and joined the Labour party more than 28 years ago, the court heard. He was a Labour councillor in the Bastwell ward in 1997 but was defeated in 1999 by the Tory candidate.The judge said the law did not allow him to disqualify Hussain from public office, but in his judgment the defendant was "entirely unfit" for such a role. He commended the returning officer and Lancashire police for "unmasking a public scandal".
