Thursday, April 2, 2015The 23-year-old is already tipping the scales at 600lbs and he is terrified that his out of control eating will cause his death if he doesn’t get a grip of his food addiction soon—Popdust has sneak peek video.Despite his humungous girth, Chay cares for his elderly grandparents, a situation that adds to his anxiety, as he fears there will be no-one to look after them if he dies first.Chay also frets that his ever increasing weight will lead to him being bedridden, and once he is unable to fend for himself his grandparents will be unable to care for him—and that would mean there would be no-one to do his grocery shopping.Not surprisingly, Chay says he is often subjected to people staring at him, and a barrage of mean muttered comments about his weight, so he now hates going out in public, but has no choice as he has to carry out his daily chores.Giving a glimpse into the depths of his food addiction, Chay’s face literally lights up as he reaches the baked goods section at the supermarket—and, after imitating a heavenly choir playing, he goes on to share, “This is my favorite section. It makes me happy.”Joni Mitchell, who was hospitalized on Tuesday, suffers from a controversial affliction called Morgellons Disease, which may be caused by delusions.Mitchell has written about her struggle with the illness, which at times has left her incapacitated. There is no cure for Morgellons and no known cause either, but the symptoms are uniquely bizarre. Most victims insist there are parasites under their skin, causing unbearable itching that leads to scratching, sores and infections.Many victims also report strange fibers under their skin, which doctors attribute to fibers from clothing or bandages. While the medical community seems to feel that the condition is a form of psychosis called ‘delusional parasitosis,’ some doctors do believe it is a physical illness.A CDC study found that Morgellons is most likely to affect middle-aged white women. Many of the patients in the CDC study showed signs of being obsessively concerned about health problems in general.About half of the people in the study had other health problems, including depression and drug abuse.The question of whether Morgellons is a disease or a delusion has prompted a continuing debate, while sufferers wait for a treatment to legitimize their symptoms.Want to see some pictures of Morgelllons Disease? Here’s one that won’t give you nightmares:If you like the harder stuff, a Morgellons Foundation has its own Flickr page which rates a full ten on a 1 to 10 scale of repulsiveness. Be warned.
