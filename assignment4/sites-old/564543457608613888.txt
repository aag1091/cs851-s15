Find MeAUTHORS & PUBLISHERS2015 is HERE!While I don't think I'll have much time reading and reviewing books this year (I'm going back to school). BUT I always love to help authors and publishers promote your books (blog tours, etc) just e-mail me at : jenna@coffeebooksandme.comReading Challenge 2015tour host of…My favorite series :)Tuesday, January 6, 2015BLOG changes, Now on YOUTUBE + GIVEAWAY!!!Hey guys! JUST in time for NEW YEAR, so I launch the new and improved COFFEE, BOOKS AND ME!!!WAIT, WHAT?WELL, I really didn’t change my blog theme and design ( I am still very much in love with this one and I have attachment issues). BUT!!! I’M CHANGING a LOT of content on my blog. Well, I will still be reviewing books (don’t worry fellow book lovers!) BUT I have decided to include BEAUTY and LIFE in my blog as well.To get those thoughts organized, I’ll put this in a Q&A style thing.QUESTION #1!!!Won’t incorporating those three things “taint” and mess up your blog?WELL, good question! I have thought about this for months and I know I haven’t blogged so much the past year, that’s why I thought it would be BETTER for my blog to have MORE life if I added my beauty-related posts and some life update posts (possibly more VLOGs from me). SINCE I recently joined the YOUTUBING world. (Well, I have created an account years before, BUT I just started making videos).That’s why if you’ve noticed my MENU has changed, and you can see NEW THREE MAIN categories: BOOKS, BEAUTY, LIFE.QUESTION #2!!!I really can’t think of a question NUMBER 2, BUT I guess it’s time to INTRODUCE my YOUTUBE channel!I have always loved makeup and skincare products and fashion… BUT it wasn’t only recently when I joined the YOUTUBE channel bandwagon. At least the making videos part. I guess it’s kind of indecisive of me to put together a BOOK and BEAUTY channel TOGETHER. BUT I really don’t like managing TWO channels and making few contents each. And SINCE I’m pretty much involved in the TWO things, I don’t see and reasons for me not doing it. I don’t know, what do you think?I also think this NEW idea and CHANGE and CHALLENGE I’m doing for myself is pretty good! BECAUSE doing the same old thing gets old, right?Anyhow, in celebrating this NEW thing/hobby I’m doing, I’m doing a GIVEAWAY! Because WHAT other way to let this make known than doing a HUGE SHOUT OUT to the WORLD right?It’s not as BIG as the giveaway I ran last month (I just picked out the winner a few days ago HERE) BUT, a giveaway is a giveaway.This will be INTERNATIONAL. And all you need to do is be SUBSCRIBED to my YOUTUBE channel. That’s IT! Then additional entries are available as well.There will be THREE winners of $25 Amazon GC (or whichever platform/site you may want- Barnes & Noble, Target, let’s figure it out along the way– I’ll just correspond with the winners). BUT For now let’s name it Amazon GC. NEAT!I’ll run this giveaway for the whole month of January until FEBRUARY so you can have more entries!!!Hi Jenna! I’m here again (because a giveaway IS a giveaway!) anyway, for my most anticipated read for the year… mmmm.. I’ve got tons! But I’ll just pick the top three that first comes to mind: 1. All the Bright Places (which is already published but I haven’t read yet!) 2. Playlist for the Dead, and 3. Liars, Inc. Thanks for this superb giveaway dear! Keeping my fingers crossed! Cheers on the new blog improvement!Ailla @ Le Bibliophile~ recently posted…FINDING X: A ReviewI kid you not when I say that there are more than 15 books that I am looking forward to this year, the list would be very long if I had to name them all. So some of the books I am excited for this year are: Winter by Marissa Meyer, The Heart of Betrayal, The Sin Eater’s Daughter by Melinda Salisbury, The Orphan Queen by Jodi Meadows, P.S. I Still Love You by Jenny Han, The Wrath and Dawn by Renee Ahdieh, etc. etc.I actually just started reading novels but I’m very interested in collecting classics from Sylvia Plath and contemporary novels from Rainbow Rowell and John GreenMika Canto recently posted…Follow my blog with Bloglovin aaayyeI don’t have just one!
