A perfect dining experienceGreat option to try when you have grown tired of Pirates or Barbecue Nation. This place nests on the top floor of a mall towards the end of the golf course road. The ambiance is similar to what you see at kebab factory. They have a pre-set menu & food was the same as you get in similar restaurants like these.The buffet menu is lavish and caters to different palettes: Awadhi to coastal to Bengali. The starters were absolutely brilliant, fresh and hot from the oven. The galauti was the star in the menu with every bite tasting like a dollop of butter.of our reviewers recommend us rather than quantity and the mutton ber pulao was non greasy and delicious. The breads were served on the table and they intelligently have reduced the size of every bread so as to limit wastage because this is one area where maximum wastage happens in a buffet.
