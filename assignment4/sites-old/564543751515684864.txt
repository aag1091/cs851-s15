My blog is simply to give daily inspiration to all people. Thank you for sharing this amazing Christian journey with me!TranslateSunday, February 8, 20152/8 PrayerEphesians 1:11 We have also received an inheritance in Him, predestined according to the purpose of the One who works out everything in agreement with the decision of His will, (HCSB)Through Jesus Christ we inherited the Holy Spirit as he promised. God predestined everything that has happened and the things to come, according to his will and purpose. Our character needs to be more Christ like and our lifestyles need to line up with the word of God. We must put away our old lifestyle and put on our new lifestyle in Christ. We are God's children. The world offers us temporary happiness that turns into misery but God offers joy, peace, love abundantly that last for eternity. When God gives something abundantly it is for us to share with others around us. Follow Jesus starting right now. If you are already following Jesus, keep pressing on until the victory is won!Photo Credit: Google ImagesPrayer Father, In the name of Jesus, we come thanking you for this beautiful day.

Thank you for your Son Jesus. Thank you for loving us! We love you! Amen!About MeHello, my name is Calandra Thompson and I live in Dallas, TX. I started Christian blogging at the beginning of 2015. I enjoy sharing the word of God with others that are seeking a relationship with him or just simply need to be inspired along the way. I am inspired by God to write each word based on reading his word and my personal experiences in life. This Christian journey is an amazing journey that all should experience. God Bless Each You!
