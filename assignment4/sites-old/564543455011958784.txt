This item has been added.Like this item?Beautiful Vintage Lamp with Pink Glass Base and Flower Appliques on the base. The lamp has original wiring as shown in the picture. I would recommend rewiring the lamp. The base is accented with metal filigree. There is no lamp shade. This would be very cute in a kitchen, bathroom and girls bedroom as an accent lamp or desk lamp. The lamp measures 14" tall and the base is 4" wide.
