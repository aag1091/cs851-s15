With any game comes a score and with a score comes a competition....all friendly, of course. The largest wager is usually a Dole Whip but mostly bragging rights. If you're like me, you want to have that high score. At some point though, you start to notice your children's scores are starting to rival yours. Then that fateful day...your children pass your score!!! If you have that high score every time, you can stop reading and don't need to watch the video. You rock, and no one will ever catch you.If you're still reading, I can help!!! It's time Mom and Dad get the 999999 Galactic Hero rank. What's the secret? The secret is all in positioning.
