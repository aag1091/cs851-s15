I) March 28 at Meydan Racecourse."Shared Belief was excellent this morning," Dan Ward, assistant to trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, said of the 4-year-old son Candy Ride who has won nine of his 10 career starts. "He ate all his feed."What happened in the past is not important," Ward said in regard to the colt's only career loss, which came with a fourth-place finish in the controversial Breeders' Cup Classic (gr.

"The only thing is the future and that would include the Santa Anita Handicap."California Chrome's trainer Art Sherman has openly expressed his wishes to keep the 4-year-old son of Lucky Pulpit in the United States since his third-place finish in last fall's Classic, but confirmed the 2014 Horse of the Year will be making the trip overseas."He's going to Dubai," Sherman said. "We're preparing for that. The horse came out of the (San Antonio) well and ate up good."
