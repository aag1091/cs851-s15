On January 21, 2015, Oum was hospitalized following a severe allergic reaction during a routine medical procedure that rendered him comatose. Rooster Teeth co-founder Burnie Burns stated that Oum was "in critical care and it is not known if he will recover". A donation page was set up for the medical expenses on GoFundMe; the goal of $50,000 was reached within three hours, with the fundraiser reaching $100,000 in four hours, and $150,000 within 24 hours. On February 1, 2015, Oum died as a result of the allergic reaction. He was 33 years old.
