Everyone posts the pictures you don't see on Instagram--the nature pictures and cool pictures. One criticism: it would be nice if you could double tap the picture to like it similar to Insta because if you're scrolling fast, it's hard to tap the tiny heart icon. Otherwise, I love this app!!All Synonyms for Magnificentby Linh with the GrinThis app is just.. GORGEOUS!! MAGNIFICENT!!!!! All other synonyms. It's just such a fun app. A picture says a thousand words, but partnered with a tune you can feel those "words". You get a sense of people more. See what the world sees, hear what the world sees, fell what the world sees. EVERYBODY needs this!!!Photos & Musicby TabithaRodI always wanted a photo sharing app like this. Choose or take a photo, edit, pick a song from the iTunes library and post! Bravo! üëèüòª
