Top Prospect Profile: #18 Austin DeCarrDrafted in the third round of the 2014 First-Year Player Draft out of the Salisbury School in Connecticut for $1,000,000. He went on to make his professional debut this past summer with the Gulf Coast Yankees in Florida where he went 2-1 with a 4.63 ERA in 11 games, 8 starts. Over all he threw 23.1 innings, striking out 24 batters and walking 7.DeCarr was drafted as a 19-year old after spending a year as a postgraduate student. In his junior year he had to have a bone spur removed from his throwing elbow that caused a drop in his velocity in his senior year of High School. Coming into his first professional season he was sitting 90-93 mile per hour with his fastball and touched 96 miles per hour during his time in the Gulf Coast League. “I actually felt like my velocity in Tampa was a tick or two lower than what it was during the spring,” he said when asked about his fastball velocity in Tampa this past year.This past September DeCarr spent the 2014 Instructional League with coaches Cory Arbiso, Greg Pavlick and Gil Patterson working on his changeup to compliment his fastball and a plus-curveball. He is continuing to work on staying low in the strike zone with his pitches. Through this off season DeCarr is working on putting on some muscle. The additional weight could help him see a small uptick in his velocity next season.Expect to see Austin begin the 2015 season in Extended Spring Training before he likely heads to Pulaski to join the rotation of the Pulaski Yankees.Share this:RelatedBorn and raised in Staten Island, NY Robert has been covering the Staten Island Yankees since the 2003 season.
