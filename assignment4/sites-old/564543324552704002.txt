It is mounted on the External Payload Facility of the European Space Agencyâ€™s Columbus module. This experiment includes several commercial HD video cameras aimed at the earth which are enclosed in a pressurized and temperature controlled housing. Video from these cameras is streamed 24/7, though there isn't always a discernable picture. Some quick notes:Black Image = The view is switching between cameras or the space station is above the night side of the Earth. Gray Image = Switching between cameras, or communications with the ISS are not available. No Audio = There are numerous, sometimes extended periods when the station cannot communicate with mission control, or when the crew and ground controllers simply don't need to talk.
