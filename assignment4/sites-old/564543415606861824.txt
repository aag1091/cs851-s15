Help Protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from Harm!For decades, the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been the target of oil companies and others who would plunder this unique and fragile land, causing irreparable harm.By recommending formal wilderness status for the Coastal Plain, the President's proposal urges Congress to ensure that the crown jewel of America's National Wildlife Refuge System will be safe from oil drilling and development for all time.Tell your members to follow the President's lead and designate the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge as wilderness!Dear Members of Congress,Subject: Designate the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge as wildernessAs a supporter of Defenders of Wildlife, I value the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as a pristine landscape and as an iconic part of America's natural heritage that should be forever protected. This week, President Obama took the bold step of becoming the first president in history to recommend that Congress permanently protect as wilderness the Arctic Refuge's Coastal Plain. Now it's time for Congress to respond to this historic call for wildlife and wilderness protection.The Arctic Refuge's Coastal Plain is an intact ecosystem that deserves protection from oil drilling that would industrialize the Refuge and destroy its unique wildlife and wilderness values. I urge you to support HR 239 and the Senate companion legislation to officially designate the Coastal Plain and other areas of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as federally protected wilderness- The Arctic Refuge is one of America's most unique natural treasures, supporting a vast array of wildlife including arctic foxes, grizzly bears, muskoxen, Dall sheep, wolves and wolverines. Birds flock to the Refuge to nest from every state in the union and six continents.- As the Refuge's biological heart and the focus of calls for industrial oil development, the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge both deserves and needs wilderness protection. The Coastal Plain is the most important onshore denning habitat for our nation's threatened polar bears and the calving ground for the over 100,000-strong Porcupine caribou herd. Oil drilling would permanently damage this special place.For the past fifty years, Americans have remained committed to protecting this remarkable area and the abundant wildlife that depends on it. I strongly support President Obama's efforts to protect the Arctic Refuge's Coastal Plain and legislation to designate the area as wilderness for the benefit of all Americans. I urge you to do so as well.[Your comments here]Sincerely, [Your name here]you have the power to create change.Start sharing and watch your impact growwe signed: Help Protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from Harm!Step 2: Confirm Your SignatureDOUBLE YOUR IMPACT!thank you for caringINCREASE YOUR IMPACTThank you, .Help Protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from Harm!SIGNATURES, please answer these quick questionsSIGN NOWFirst NameLast NameEmailCountryStreet AddressCitySending...Share my signature on FacebookSPONSORED BY:embed this petition onto your site or blogMake a difference for the issues you care about while adding cool interactive content.
