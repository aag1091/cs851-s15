Needless to say I needed an army of assistants to help manage and continue to grow my accounts. All I can say after using TweetAdder is Nothing and I mean Nothing can even come close to the growth & management tools as well as easy to understand tutorials that are in this software. As well as the new features they add each week. If you are New to Twitter or a Seasoned Pro… Get this software now… Thanks Again Guys! Keep Up The Good Work!”Tweetadder was the very first marketing software I ever used. I saw the benefits of using Tweet Adder and became an affiliate immediately. The facility to leave Tweetadder on and loop messages all day long (particularly hashtagged messages) while I am in my other day job has paid for itself many times over, I have come home from work and found affiliate sales. The software has actually sold itself over five times since I bought it (so I am already in profit) and its also just under 1k so far of my other promotions. It is still one of the best softwares for people serious about marketing on Twitter to use. It provides the industry benchmark for online marketing which all other social media services are to be compared against. What makes Tweetadder unique is that once you have bought the software the ongoing updates are free.Christopher Collins, Tweet-Eye.comI can’t emphasize enough how much this tool has helped me grow my twitter following over the last months. Tweet Adder has helped me to target in such a helpful way. When my book finally gets published, I’ll have the right audience to tell about it. Thank you!You have remarkable service support, which is unusual these days. It matches your terrific product.Mark D. Bowles, Ph.D., Professor of History, American Military UniversityLet me say something. You have an amazing theme and amazing/awesome support. At first I wasn’t too sure I would like TweetAdder 4, but now I love it way better than TweetAdder 3. I can actually follow 100 people & unfollow 100 people in 5 minutes. Way quicker in TweetAdder 4 than TweetAdder 3. In TweetAdder 3 it would take an hour on automatic. Lots of kewl new enhancements! I don’t mind if you let others know my opinion! Please consider this a glowing recommendation. Once again thanks ppl.FunkeyjimDid you know that the man who built R2D2 for Star Wars uses Tweetadder? Well you do know now!
