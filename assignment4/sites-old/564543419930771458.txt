52 Healing Scriptures – Hebrews 10:23On February 3, 2015 at 11:30 AM, I had just driven out of a conference, with my sister, when the Holy Spirit gave me the above scriptural verse. When I received it, I was engaged in a dialog with my sister and so I did not ask any questions of the Holy Spirit.She drove while we conversed. We operated in an air of anticipation and joy. We were expecting good news. I looked up the scripture and thought this must be related to the blog article I am writing about faith. I was very wrong. In a few minutes we got bad news.Then I realised the Lord was saying, “What seems bad is only a delay. I have promised and I am faithful to fulfill My word. Delay is not denial.You must be careful of what you speak. Only confess My promise from your mouth. Meditate on it only. Let not your sight determine what you believe.”II Corinthians 5:7 (NKJV)For we walk by faith, not by sight.Hebrews 10:38 (NKJV)Now the just shall live by faith; But if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him.”Hebrews 11:6 (NKJV)But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.Matthew 11:12 (NKJV)And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
