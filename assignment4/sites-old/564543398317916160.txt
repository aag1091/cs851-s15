** This is a PROMOTED POST ... so PLEASE LIKE, COMMENT and SHARE to help SPREAD the EXPOSURE!! **I'm faced with a choice: Believe Mitch when he tells me that he’s a cop and the reason he’s looking for Paul’s sister is because she’s stolen his son and she’s wanted for child abuse or believe Paul and his sister Marie: Mitch is the abuser and Marie and Victor are in danger. I lean towards believing Paul and Marie while developing feelings for Paul and dealing with complications that are bound to come up when my mother comes to live with me. Just when I begin accepting my feelings for Paul, Mitch finds Marie and Paul is forced to leave town to help her hide. Will our love story end just as it’s beginning?See More
