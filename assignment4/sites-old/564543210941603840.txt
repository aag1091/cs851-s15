Honestly, I'd been working on that costume for about a year before I even got to wear it. I didn't have a giant selection (I used to live in a really small town >.<)o I used upholstery vinyl to make the corset and bracers and the "wrong" side of some satin for my bustle. No, questions are never a bother ^.^ and it looks like Germany took it in a crushing victory over pretty much everyone else.What you achieved can only be perceived as "perfect". Being able to transform, mix and recreate an original piece demands originality and creativity. it is not as easy as it looks. You have done an amazing job, congrats.
