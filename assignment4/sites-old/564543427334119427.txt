Like this item?SeaGlass Pendant Beach glass Brown White and Green Sea Glass center drilled, I added a antiqued silver 3d Palm tree Charm and attached it to a silver plated 20 inch Snake chain, it comes in a teal gift box. These pieces of sea glass like all my sea glass are found on the beaches of South East Texas by myself and my children. I never artificially tumble my sea glass.Sea glass or beach glass (also known as mermaid's tears) is glass found on beaches that has been tumbled and smoothed by the water and sand, creating small pieces of smooth, frosted glass. I like to think of it as the seaâ€™s way of recycling glass for another use. Did you know it takes the sea 30 years to make sea glass? The color of sea glass is determined by its original source. Most sea glass comes from bottles, but it can also come from jars, plates, windows, windshields, ceramics or sea pottery.With recycling efforts in effect all around the world sea glass has become harder to find and will continue to decrease making it truly a gift from the sea!Thank you, I hope you have a sun filled day!
