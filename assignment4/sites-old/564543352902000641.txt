Roosevelt High School student, was 16 when he flipped his truck on Crum Elbow Road into a marshy area.The section of County Route 41 in Hyde Park “where our son Claudio passed away will forever be the Claudio Coppola Memorial Highway,” said the teen’s dad Luigi Coppola.Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro said the Coppola family embodies what the community here stands for: sharing both joy and sadness, coming together in times of need.In the two plus years since Claudio Coppola’s death, teens and others volunteering for the nonprofit Claudio Cares have “collected and distributed over 115,000 pounds of food to food banks on both sides of the river,” Luigi Coppola said, at a benefit dinner on Friday in honor of his son.They’ve also collected back-to-school supplies, clothes and money for those in need.
