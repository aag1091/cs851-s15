I'm glad Jupiter Ascending is bombing. It's the worst film I've seen this year and probably the worst film I've seen since The Lone Ranger. The story was ridiculous badly written. The dialog was absolutely terrible, and so bad the audience was laughing at the film throughout it, and not in a good way. The supposed 170 million dollar effects weren't impressive. In my showing three, which was hardly packed at least three people walked out on Jupiter Ascending. I thought about it, but I paid to see the film, so I was going to sit through the entire film no matter how terrible the Wachowski's new film was.
