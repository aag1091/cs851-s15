I've lost about 30 lbs in a month and a half between keto and the physical activities. As for dinners, I haven't repeated much aside from a few takeout favorites. I've made everything from cauli-crust pizza to a big ol' steak, "taco" salad, portobello burgers, zoodles and Alfredo... the list goes on. Breakfast and lunch has been the secret to me. For breakfast I've been making giant 12 egg frittatas every week, eating a wedge every day for breakfast. And lunches have been mainly creative ways to have salads - sardine and avocado on a bed of lettuce is a favorite of mine.
