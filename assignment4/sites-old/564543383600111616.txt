A blog dedicated to The Legend of Korra and Avatar The Last Airbender.JDS: I’m kind of the default “warrior dude” designer, so I took the initial pass on Tonraq’s design for Book One. By the time we got to Book Two, we knew he was playing a much bigger role and his design needed to be refined. The idea was that he’s built like a barbarian and fights brutish, in-your-face style that contrasts with his brother’s slender frame and elegant technique. Expressions by Ki-Hyun Ryu. Tonraq character design by Joaquim Dos Santos and Bryan Konietzko.
