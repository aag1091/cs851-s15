Going to look for sea glass gives us a chance to unplug from the world and enjoy the beauty of the Ocean and all it has to offer.Sea glass or beach glass (also known as mermaid's tears) is glass found on beaches that has been tumbled and smoothed by the water and sand, creating small pieces of smooth, frosted glass. I like to think of it as the seaâ€™s way of recycling glass for another use. Did you know it takes the sea 30 years to make sea glass? The color of sea glass is determined by its original source. Most sea glass comes from bottles, but it can also come from jars, plates, windows, windshields, ceramics or sea pottery.With recycling efforts in effect all around the world sea glass has become harder to find and will continue to decrease making it truly a gift from the sea!Thank you, I hope you have a sun filled day!
