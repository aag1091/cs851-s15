Jack Colback struck for Newcastle, but John Carver's men could not keep their lead as they drew 1-1 with Stoke.Newcastle United's season continues to tick by in unspectacular fashion with a 1-1 draw at home to Stoke offering little evidence that the Magpies can take flight to the business end of the table before the season is out.They had been lifted by the 3-0 win at Hull City last weekend on a day when there were few complaints from the United faithful.But here, Stoke City presented Newcastle with a much tougher defence to break through, and it eventually took its toll on a Toon side that is not exactly oozing with confidence. Things looked good as the clock ticked beyond the 89-minute mark, but you just never know with Newcastle.Seasoned observers in the stands at St James' Park knew that those wearing black and white are always capable of shooting themselves in the foot. Newcastle couldn't hold out after Jack Colback's classy strike, and after a hit-and-hope cross from Geoff Cameron, Peter Crouch headed home the equaliser.Boss John Carver would have been disappointed to see his Newcastle defence open up, and the Toon back four watched on as the England veteran headed home.Gabriel Obertan and Ayoze Perez both missed gilt-edged chances to seal the match but nothing but agony was on the cards for the Newcastle faithful. There's still 14 games left to play, of course, but Newcastle last won two games on the spin back in early November.Putting together two 45 minute spells had been hard enough up until the rout at the KC Stadium -- now back-to-back displays of winning football seems beyond them.And we're heading into the unknown again unless that picks up. Carver has to win games to keep the job with a top 10 finish the minimum delivery for him to have any chance of keeping hold of the post he loves.With the search for a new head coach postponed until the summer and several candidates not available until the end of the season, it's hard to see how Newcastle pull themselves out of uncertainty.Just to give it the edge, their next game is against none other than former boss Alan Pardew. And if there was an air of inevitability about Crouch's equaliser at St James' Park there are fears that Pardew's grin could be haunting Toon fans come Wednesday night.After all, wouldn't it just sum it all up if Pardew came back to get one over his former club? Well, there is little to take from the 1-1 draw with Stoke. Poor finishing, a failure to stay switched on and a real "season over" feel are currently loitering around Carver's men at the moment.Three points against Stoke would have at least injected a bit of solidity to the team's league position and allowed them to climb into the top 10. Instead, with two away games at Palace and then Manchester City to come before the month is over, it could be another stumble to the 40 point mark.
