Pod of Sperm Whales Caught on Camera in a Rare Event (VIDEO)Sperm whales have the largest brain of any creature known to live on Earth. They are incredibly intelligent giants who feed on about one ton of fish and squid per day. These wonderful animals, however, are somewhat elusive. They regularly dive as deep as 1,000 meters in search of food and can hold their breath for up to 90 minutes while doing so, making sightings few and far between.These endangered animals were hunted into near extinction during the 18th and 19th centuries for oil and Ambergris (a valuable substance once used in perfumes that is actually a substance that forms in their stomachs), but their population has made a comeback thanks to conservation efforts. This footage shows a pod of sperm whales off the coast of Dana Point in Southern California, playing together near the ocean’s surface in a rare event.This footage allows us to truly marvel and admire these amazing creatures. Sperm whales are still threatened by human actions, and seeing how wonderful they are can only help to inspire us to protect them and their oceans.Using photos from artists across the world, Overdevelopment, Overpopulation, Overshoot (OVER) provides detailed insight into the breadth of the current problem and offers a solution in the form of consciousness which will inspire action.Disclosure: One Green Planet accepts advertising, sponsorship, affiliate links and other forms of compensation, which may or may not influence the advertising content, topics or articles written on this site.
