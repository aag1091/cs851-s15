BATTLE OF MARENGO: A MAJOR MILITARY VICTORY FOR NAPOLEONThe Battle of Marengo was one of Napoleon’s greatest military victories. The Frenchman was at the height of his military powers, and drove Austrian forces out of Italy.It was fought on the Marengo Plain - about three miles from Alessandria - between 28,000 French troops and 31,000 Austrians led by General Michael Friedrich von Melas.It brought about the French occupation of the Lombardy region up to the Mincio River.At first, the Austrians attacked at Alessandria while the French were separated - leading General Melas to believe he had won.But after the French were pushed back, Napoleon gathered his extra troops from Turin - and forced the Austrians into a retreat.They also laid traditional Habsburg black and white diagonal tiles in all three entrance halls and created three black and white marble staircases.The property also has two dining rooms, two kitchens, ten reception rooms and a guest house.There are beautiful formal gardens and terraces along with a vineyard which, if restored, could produce around 100,000 bottles of wine per year.The owners have now put the villa and its grounds on the market with Beauchamp Estates.Gary Hersham, of Beauchamp Estates, said: ‘Villa La Voglina is a wonderful classic Italian Baroque villa, architecturally and historically significant as an example of Juvarra’s work and of a stature that does not often come to the market.‘With a sizeable parcel of land, it would make a truly stunning and tranquil private retreat.‘Located as it is in one of Italy’s most celebrated culinary and wine producing regions, reinstatement of the vineyards would be in-keeping with the region and the property’s history, in addition to assisting with the running of the estate.‘The region attracts a great many visitors, both domestic and international, many of who are drawn to the area for its culinary and viticulture reputation.‘This ever increasing appeal means that the property will also be of interest to those wishing to develop commercial activity, both small independent operators and those of scale.’Luxury dwelling: The estate agents say the property and its grounds 'would make a truly stunning and tranquil private retreat'Out and in: Captured Austrian troops created three black and white marble staircases (right), which grace the central property todayTaking a look: The 74-room mansion used by Napoleon Bonaparte as his headquarters during the famous battle has been put up for saleFrench emperor: Napoleon Bonaparte as pictured in the 1864 painting Campagne de France (1814), by Jean-Louis-Ernest MeissonierLynne Davie, of Beauchamp Estates Florence, added: ‘We are excited to be marketing such a wonderful estate and magnificent villa.‘Villa La Voglina is so ideally located, benefitting from the beautiful Piemonte region while at the same time affording excellent communication links, across Europe and internationally.’The flat marketed by Beauchamp at a similar price in Belgravia – that of £3.6million - is billed as a being ‘luxurious and stylish apartment’, with one bedroom and one master bedroom.The estate agent's description says the home on exclusive Eaton Square is ‘newly refurbished with interiors finished to a very high standard’.
