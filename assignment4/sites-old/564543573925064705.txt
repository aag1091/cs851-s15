This Fabolous Pusha T type beat instrumental goes hard like the Fabolous Og project album released Jan 2015 by fab. We took it back to the streets with that crack Pusha T type instrumental sound.Hip hop beats that sound like this have been missing for a while people are used to the same old style trap beats and dirty south rap beats. That's why we took it back to that original New York style beat sound.If you look at Pusha T 's beats his rap beats sound like they where produced in new york even though he's from atlanta. We love that true underground instrumental sound we think more artist should be doing it.So that's what we did on this Fabolous/Pusha T style instrumental we stuck with that real hip hop underground beat formula. So I hope you enjoyed the instrumental and if you want the rights to the beat click below.
