Yesterday I was in a teddy coat found at Buffalo Exchange (check Instagram for the find shot). Also a vintage lurex gold dress and the Sophie Hulme bag. This coat is such a head turning emerald - I love it.Note. The coat buttons need updating to newer ones. Should I go with dome black ones or gold? I think either works.I LOVE this look! The dress is nice and the coat too. Love the color of both. I say black, but it will be exciting to see what you end up choosing. The black look less noticeable and let the coat color stand out more.Hi Karen I just want to let u know how much I enjoy your blog. You inspire me to get out of my comfort zone and try new things. Its because of u that I am now into pointy shoes and that I have turned a forgotten clutch into a bag! Thank u for all this. Lol evaTHAT'S what I love to hear: getting inspired enough to try new things. That's half the fun of all of this anyway. OMG wait till you see the pointy shoes I just found this week! I'll Instagram them soon!
