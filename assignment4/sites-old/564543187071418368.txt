Ways to Hack Your Job for a Much Happier Career LifeResearch has found that falling in love and having a super-sweet, fulfilling career can be really similar in terms of satisfaction—which makes sense, right? When you wake up excited to go to work everyday, you feel the same pop n’ sizzle as being in love. You’re thinking about all the possibilities and ways to incorporate that person (or job opportunities!) into your life.This is because both add a sense of dimension and promise to your life, according to an interview Fast Company conducted with Kevin McIntyre, professor of psychology at Trinity University explains: “If you ask people to describe themselves, one of the first things they list is their employment. It’s thought to be a core central aspect of people’s identity,” says McIntyre explains, which is why seeking opportunities to grow is key to our happiness. “People really love this feeling of self-expansion.”The idea that you are growing and thriving equates to waking up hyped for work everyday. McIntyre says you generate this feeling by connecting with new people on the job, honing small skills social networking and do anything you can to avoid becoming bored in your career life (studies have found the feeling is actually counterproductive).Other ways to up your game on the job? Start small. For instance, answering emails in under two minutes can boost productivity, because if you wait on them, they’ll take you longer to reassess and respond to later. Even sitting up taller in your desk chair can improve your job life; research shows will make you feel more positive vibes while doing your job.
