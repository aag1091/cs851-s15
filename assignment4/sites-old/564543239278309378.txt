People ask me why I paint money... short answer is it absolutely controls my life. I attended 4 years of graduate school to pursue a career I do not enjoy and a career that has put me close to half a million in debt. I now realize the importance of life is to pursue what you love and obviously for me it is art.I paint money as an ironic means to cope with the enormous debt I am currently facing... I paint money, to sell for money, to pay back money I owe.I do not see money as good nor bad. At times I praise it for the benefits and charity it can provide and at times i loathe it for the corruption and anxiety it can create.
