WELCOME TOLONDON BEER WEEKThe first London Beer Week launched in February 2015, and was a true celebration of beers, ales, lagers and ciders alike, set against the backdrop of the capital. We saw pop-ups and parties, masterclasses and self-guided Beer Tours around some of London's best bars – and with more than 8,000 of you joining us to raise a glass, it couldn’t have been better!
