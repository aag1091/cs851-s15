I'm amazed that I've only found one video of this show so far. One! Where have the fangirls gone? It's Cillian Murphy, I thought they'd be all over this.Anyway, brilliant show. Was curious after the first episode, was completely sold after the second.If this video makes you want to watch the show, even just a little, go and watch it now.For the cinematography, if nothing else. Ugh *______*Here's a trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WGboo...Song | Who Did That To You (Django Unchained OST)Artist | John LegendClips | Peaky Blinders (c) BBCPS. LOOK GUYS LOOK!!!!
