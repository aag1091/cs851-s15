She claimed they were at the library together.In the new affidavit, McClain wrote that after her interview with "Serial" producers she realized how important she was to the case and made the decision to once again step forward.No comment from producers behind the podcast yet ... but Adnan's family friend Rabia Chaudry tweeted, "My heart is full. Adnan gets a new appeal. God is good."
