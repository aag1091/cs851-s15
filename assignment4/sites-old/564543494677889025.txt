#1 Courteney Cox Botox WhoasOne "Friends" star not aging too gracefully is Courteney Cox. The star has made dramatic alterations to her looks through Botox and surgeries. The 48 year old Cox has admitted to minor amounts of work. However, fans disagree as there are moments she's almost unrecognizable. Her lips and cheeks seem overdone and out of place. Something has caused the sound of her voice to be altered. While she is virtually wrinkle free, she's also widely known as having a frozen face. The star has even admitted, "I think Botox is fantastic and also horrible."
