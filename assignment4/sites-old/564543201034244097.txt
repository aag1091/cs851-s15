EU trade deal boosts Pakistan exports by $1bn: ministerIslamabad - Pakistani exports to the European Union increased by more than a billion dollars after a landmark trade deal last year which made its products more competitive, the commerce minister told AFP.The EU signed a law in late 2013 granting Pakistan so-called “GSP-plus” status, which means firms pay no tax on certain categories of goods exported to the 27-nation bloc for 10 years.The EU makes GSP-plus conditional on implementing international conventions on human and labour rights, and there have been fears Pakistan’s decision to end a moratorium on executions could affect the deal.Pakistan’s key textile industry in particular welcomed the agreement, which came into force in January 2014, and in an interview with AFP commerce minister Khurram Dastgir Khan hailed its impact.But EU diplomats in Islamabad have said that while they are concerned about the return to hangings, the development was unlikely to affect the GSP-plus arrangement immediately.Improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last Pakistan People’s Party government was a key pledge in Sharif’s election campaign in 2013, when he was swept to power for a third term.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said this week the government’s reform programme — tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender — was on track.
