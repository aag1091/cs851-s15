Kasabian 360° Interactive Video - Watch The Band Play 'Club Foot' Like Never BeforePosted on 05 Feb 15Well, this has knocked our socks off. Kasabian are notorious for their explosive live shows: chaotic frenzies of ribcage-rattling bass rumbles and light show spectacles, fronted by two of indie's most seasoned showmen in Tom Meighan and Serge Pizzorno. That chaos is captured like never before in this cutting edge 360° interactive video from O2 and Columbia Records, Sony Music UK and virtual reality specialists Visualise. Filmed at one of the Leicester group's O2 Academy Brixton shows in December, the video lets you guide yourself around the venue, from a tonne of different perspectives: on stage with the band, on the front row with the die-hards fans, backstage, from the press pit... Basically, if you're a Kasabian fan, it's a must-watch. Give it a watch above.
