Killer, I'm really sorry if this offends you but is being agender something like being gender fluid? Is it the same? I don't quite understand all these gender/sexuality terms and I don't want to google it in case I get the wrong information and I accidentally say something offensive so I'd rather ask someone who is agender I'm sorry. If I worded this in an offensive way I'm so sorry it wasn't intended to be offensive I'm sorry. I just want to know so I can properly respect others I'm sorry.asked by Anonymousit’s different from genderfluid bc genderfluid is when you have a gender but it fluctuates, and genderfluid people do sometimes identify as agender. agender is when you have no gender whatsoever and if people try to give you one you have permission to fight them. this was not offensive and i like your approach.I've never understood agender. Like, if you have female genitalia you can still identify as agender? And vice versa with male genitalia? Like, you can have it but not identify as that gender, right? Just trying to understand, not wanting to offend. I'm sorry if I do, though. I swear I don't mean it, Killer.asked by Anonymousit’s understandable, really. you can identify as agender despite your genitalia. it has no affect on your mental state and cannot be used to define you.I've very recently started using they/them pronouns for myself, how should I tell my friends about this so that they refer to me as this as well? It's not that I'm afraid of telling people or of people knowing I'm just worried people won't take me seriously.asked by Anonymoussooo how do people address you?? so they use ms. or mr. ??? he or she? him or her? like for example if i were to say "she ( talking about you) is over there" will that upset you? how will i say that? without offending you??asked by Anonymousthis is mx alexei ‘killer’. they are fabulous. they are standing over there. they are the one holding the spear. run.
