Buy differently.Rab the bunnyI bought this for my 8 month old grandson for Christmas. He liked it well enough; he will need to grow into it. However, his 4 year old and 6 year old cousins went wild: a girl and a boy respectively. Each managed to sequester Rab and play with him: he was a pillow, a blanket, he was talked to and hugged. He was a great success. I will need to buy two more for the cousins.About CraftholicGreat Big HugsFrom a Japanese company called Craftholic come three cuddly creatures sure to get plenty of smiles and hugs.Rab the Bunny, Loris the Monkey, and Sloth the Bear are no ordinary stuffed animals.
