02.08.15Summary: An interlude calling for additional evidence and a roundup of things to comeFOLLOWING our coverage of the Ivan Kabalin case we intend to delve deeper into the corrupt affairs of SIPO, the Croatian roots of the EPO’s current (for now) Vice-President, Željko Topić. As opposition grows from within and outside the EPO, including some coverage from German newspapers, Danish papers etc. we don’t expect the EPO to last in its current form. It’s an utter turmoil and this isn’t due to anything other than bad conduct (if not misconduct) from the EPO’s management.We recently received a lot of SIPO material by E-mail and we invite readers to add to our body of supportive evidence so that we can carry on shedding light on what Topić has been trying to suppress. If you choose to send material by E-mail, please consider using Tor or some other anonymising software for increased protection. The EPO's own Stasi Unit, for example, wrongly assumes that material comes from EPO staff. It has a track record of harassing people whom it views as detrimental to the management’s façade. █Share this post:These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.Microsoft's lobbying apparatus is trying to hook entire nations into PRISM (i.e. NSA espionage) with proprietary Microsoft formats and proprietary software, especially now that nations have policies in place and Free software available which renders Microsoft obsoleteMicrosoft's charm offensives against Free/libre software are proving to be rather effective, despite them involving a gross distortion of facts and exploitation of corruptible elements in the corporate media
