I normally made this punch with lots of fresh fruit floating in it and served it on New Years Eve. The secret was always in making it several days before. (I used to do it the day after Christmas!)My Favorite Punch!1 Pint of Southern Comfort1 Lg can of frozen orange juice (large size)1 sm can of frozen lemonade1 bottle (sm) of grenadine syrup1 2 litre bottle of 7 up (or other clear soda)____________________________________3 Sliced Granny Smith Apples Core Removed1 Bottle Maraschino Cherries (drained)3 Seedless Oranges peeled and sectioned1 Large pineapple cored and cubedCombine all of the liquid ingredients (save the fruit) and let ferment at least 1 day/night in the refrigerator. The day before you plan to serve you should then add all of the fruit and let it sit for another 24 hours.Serve very cold in punch cupsThis will serve a very large group (I used to have a count but I do not anymore) It is very potent. The fruit is excellent if instructions are followed to the letter!Enjoy!
