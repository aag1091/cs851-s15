Neurologic manifestations of vitamin B-12 deficiency in a military hospital.AuthorsJournalMil Med. 1991 Apr;156(4):201-4.AffiliationAbstractAlthough it is well recognized that patients with cobalamin (vitamin B-12) deficiency can develop neuropsychiatric problems, primary care physicians do not frequently realize that patients presenting with only vague neurologic complaints can have vitamin B-12 deficiency as the etiology. During a 1-year period, six patients presented to the Neurology Clinic at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, after evaluation at the primary care level for their neurologic complaints. All six had cobalamin deficiency, and none were anemic. Military primary care physicians should be aware of the various neurologic presentations of these patients.
