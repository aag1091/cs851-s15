Finding Furever Homes is a registered charity set up in 2013 by Andrea Newton with 3 main aims in mind:1. To find loving forever homes for rescue dogs in need.2. To organise fundraising to support rescue costs.3. To raise awareness of the growing problem of unwanted dogs in the UK.Finding Furever Homes aims to support smaller dog rescues who are located throughout the UK. Many of these small rescue centres go unnoticed and receive very little support or funding, whether that is hands on volunteering, dog walking, home checks, transportation or most importantly, helping them to re-home dogs in need.
