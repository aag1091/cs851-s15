Brothers of the mine rejoice!Swing, swing, swing with meRaise your pick and raise your voice!Sing, sing, sing with meDown and down into the deepWho knows what we'll find beneath?Diamonds, rubies, gold and moreHidden in the mountain storeBorn underground, suckled from a teat of stoneRaised in the dark, the safety of our mountain homeSkin made of iron, steel in our bonesTo dig and dig makes us freeCome on brothers sing with me!The sunlight will not reach this lowDeep, deep in the mineNever seen the blue moon glowDwarves won't fly so highFill a glass and down some mead!Stuff your bellies at the feast!Stumble home and fall asleepDreaming in our mountain keepBorn underground, grown inside a rocky wombThe earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become our tombFace us on the battlefield; you will meet your doomWe do not fear what lies beneathWe can never dig too deep
