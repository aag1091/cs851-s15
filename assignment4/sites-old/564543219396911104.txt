Since AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd was arrested and charged with drug possession and “threatening to kill” last year, the band have been on the lookout for someone to help the band’s future run a little more smoothly. Now the group’s former drummer, Chris Slade, has confirmed he will be returning to the band.In a statement posted to Facebook, Slade — who played with Acca Dacca on The Razor’s Edge album tour, as well as 1993 single Big Gun — announced his return to the AC/DC drum stool will begin immediately.“YES the drum stool is under OLD management! You will, I am sure know by now, CHRIS SLADE will re-join AC/DC for the GRAMMYS tomorrow Sunday 8th Feb and for their new ROCK OR BUST tour,” the post reads, before a personal message from Slade.“This is an amazing opportunity for me, after all most people don’t ever get to play with their favourite band once, let alone TWICE! I would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming support I have been shown personally, on the Facebook page and other social media, not one comment has gone unread and it has been very humbling, Thanks so much.“We apologise for the secrecy, please understand this was for all the right reasons.” Rumours of Slade’s imminent return to AC/DC arose last week, after he cancelled a scheduled meet-and-greet at a California Optometry practice.AC/DC have a busy year ahead, taking to the stage at the 57th Grammy Awards today, before heading out on tour in support of their latest album, Rock Or Bust, with a Coachella headline set also lined up.The band’s Grammy Awards performance in Los Angeles will be the band’s first national TV appearance in 14 years, and their first public live performance since the release of Rock Or Bust. The Rock Or Bust tour currently includes European and North American dates, with Australian tour plans looking likely for late 2015 or early 2016.Phil Rudd lawyer recently quit his client’s case, and the drummer is now due in court for a case review in April.
