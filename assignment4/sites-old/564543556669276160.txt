This item has been added.Like this item?Nothing captures a moment more than a picture, but how can you make a picture out of your song? Make the words of the song an Art Piece! That's what I did when I wanted to get some art on the wall, I wanted something that was meaningful to me and captured a moment in time.So I custom print each song on cardstock using different Fonts and sizes and then decoupage it onto canvas to make it the beautiful art piece that it is!All you need to do is provide me with the Song (or any special requests, like wedding date or names)
