Wilfred's Simple Thoughts, Volume 1 W/Signature"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."—Ralph Waldo EmersonThe decision to write this book started with a reading from a psychic. My life was in total chaos! Not only had I been rejected after proposing to my girlfriend, I lost everything, from my dignity to the little social status I actually had. I was going nowhere and the snowball effect of my fall was growing larger by the day. When I say I lost it all, I mean it. This includes best friends, family, and loved ones. I was desperate for guidance and completely lost; so I searched for any and all means of spiritual finding. It is that journey that led me to where I am now. My state of dismay did not come without purpose, and it is this purpose that will forever linger in my heart.This book will entail the many aspects of my journey—its ups and downs and the future of my being. I don't intend for it to become a best seller but rather a tool to jump-start the beginning of my newfound path. Its purpose lies in helping to inspire the uninspired, motivate those who are going through troubled times, and to propel the future of our world in many ways.
