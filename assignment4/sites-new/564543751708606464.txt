I speak truth from experience because fairytale living doesn't exist.Have You Loved You Lately?I’m no expert about life, relationships, religion or love, but I am an expert on my personal experiences and with theses experiences I have learned to face my truths. I often find myself in situations and conversations with people who are wounded and seeking assistance for encouragement. Though not always an experience of mine, I do my best to offer motivation to move forward and to not place too much emphasis on the what isn’t and what could have been. More like, what is.Love, what’s that? It’s a verb from what I have heard, but of course it’s easier said than done, simply because love is not something many have mastered to do. Before you can accept love from someone else, you must first learn to love self. All the excuses must stop and all the lesser expectations must die in order to receive what you are able to offer.So if you are not loving yourself, you can’t possibly love another or accept the love you deserve or desire.
