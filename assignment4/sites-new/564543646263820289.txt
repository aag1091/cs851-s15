Valentine’s Gift Ideas: 10 Under £10For today’s Valentine’s Gift Ideas post I have put together a gift guide of ten Valentine’s gifts, all of which cost under £10 each. Around this time of year, the prices of romantic gifts, such as chocolate and lingerie, are often hiked up. However, as this guide shows, if you shop savvy you don’t have to spend a fortune to treat that special someone (or yourself!) to something nice. The guide features some traditional gifts, but also fashion and beauty themed items.One commentThat scarf is so cute! I’ve been looking for something with a fairisle pattern for winter that isn’t a round necked itchy jumper for ages – hurray! It’s strangely never occurred to me that LUSH does lip gloss.
