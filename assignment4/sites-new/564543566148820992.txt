This week’s non-profit is March Madness Marching Band. MMMB is organized exclusively for charitable, scientific and educational purposes, more specifically for music and dance education and performances, and the promotion of Central Kentucky civic and cultural activities. Formed to represent Local First Lexington (LFL) in Lexington’s 2008 downtown Christmas Parade, MMMB has earned a wealth of parade awards, community pride, ear-to-ear grins, and statewide praise. MMMB has now also earned federal tax exempt status! MMMB honors and promotes the diverse talents and contributions of people who choose to invest in Kentucky. Band members encourage audiences to support independent local businesses, restaurants, civic organizations, and artists – all of which help our communities prosper and remain unique.Share this:Share on TumblrEmailPrint
