ϟCollectiveϟ @illfolkmusic Dystopia Sound Let's collab (ANY genres, esp Future Beats)! (◕‿-)Msg here or @ the below! ✉ Inquiries: RaneRaps@gmail.com Redefining jack of all trades, RaneRaps is an archetypal artist that actually excels in the styles of music he makes. With influences ranging from The Cool Kids & Amy Winehouse to Prince & Vic Mensa, you never know what to expect next but you can bet it’ll surely be soul-soothing. RaneRaps has a knack for dynamically flowing lyrics whether he’s rapsinging in a syncopated fashion or hitting every beat precisely. Coupled with his way of blending the imagery and realities of everyday joy and pain, he creates a seamless hypnotic sound. The L.A.-born artist never disappoints onstage either, carrying an unapologetic charisma too strong for any crowd to resist. Having leapt into the L.A. scene with the track "Liddo Red Wagon", co-produced with his iLLFolk bandmate, Els3vn, RaneRaps has carved his niche in his solo artistry. Whether it is the “Worst Day Ever” or you just have “Desperate Desires” for a chimerical hip-hop adventure, RaneRaps soothes and satisfies.
