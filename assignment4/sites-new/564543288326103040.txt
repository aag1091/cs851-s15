Cuthbert: O'Neill a different class08 February 2015Cork's Colm O'Neill. INPHOColm O'Neill's 'class' was the difference between Cork and Monaghan today according to his manager Brian Cuthbert.The Rebel County forward helped himself to 2-6 against the Farney County and, speaking to RTE Sport, Cuthbert said: "I thought his man-marker Ryan Wylie was doing very well, he turned him over a good few times, but the class that Colm has, he can just light up at times."The two goals, we badly needed them, and they gave us a bit of impetus and a chance to win the game."Without them there was only going to be one winner."The Rebel County boss is 'very happy' to have two wins under the belt heading into the three week break."It's only February, the second game of the league. We've a long way to go but going home we're very happy."
