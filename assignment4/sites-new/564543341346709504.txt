Julianne Moore added a BAFTA to her collection of prestigious awards this evening, having been awarded ‘Best Actress in a Leading Role’ for her heart-wrenching portrayal of a woman with early-onset dementia in the film Still Alice. The 54-year-old actress has already won 17 awards for her performance and has also been nominated for an Oscar.Based on a book of the same title, Still Alice tells the story of Alice Howland, a professor at Columbia University who develops a rare form of familial Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 50. The film explores the implications of the disease which, in Alice’s case, has a genetic cause and carries the risk of being passed down to her children.At the UK Charity Premiere earlier this week (Thursday 5 February), hosted on behalf of Alzheimer’s Society, Moore met people living with dementia, a full-time carer and an Alzheimer’s Society Dementia Support Worker – a professional who helps people come to terms with their diagnosis.Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive of Alzheimer’s Society, said:‘I’m absolutely delighted that Julianne Moore has been recognised for her terrific portrayal as a person with early-onset dementia. Still Alice does so much to tackle the stigma and shame all too often associated with the condition. Her award-winning performance is incredibly powerful.‘Alzheimer’s Society was honoured to host the UK Charity Premiere of Still Alice at the Curzon in Mayfair earlier this week. This prestigious recognition for Julianne’s performance is certainly well deserved and will really help raise awareness and increase understanding of dementia worldwide.’
