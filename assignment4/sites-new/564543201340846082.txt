Opened in 1990 and located in Miyagi Prefecture, "Zao Fox Village" is a sanctuary home to over a hundred free-roaming foxes, including the silver fox and the platinum fox as well as the Japanese red fox.You can get close to the animals, so in that regards, the fox village is kind of like cat island or bunny island.As Japan Travel explains, you purchase fox food for 100 yen (less than a dollar), but the park doesn't recommend feeding the animals by hand. Also, this might not be the best place to take small children, because, as cute as foxes are, they're still wild animals and not really kid-friendly.Visitors can get quite close to the animals, which have free reign of the sanctuary. But once again, it's not recommend that you try to pet the animals. And please don't bother them if they're curled up asleep!
