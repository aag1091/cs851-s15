The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for central New York, the western Catskills and much of New England through early Tuesday. All public schools in Boston would be closed Monday and Tuesday, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said Sunday afternoon, and the public was urged to stay off roadways until the storm passes. Courts also announced they would close Monday due to the forecast, delaying jury selection in the Boston Marathon bombing case and in the ongoing murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez in Fall River, Massachusetts. The snow is likely to cause problems for commuters on Monday, though it’s not expected to accumulate as rapidly as in some of the earlier storms, including a record-busting late January blizzard. There also is little risk seen of significant coastal flooding, a problem during last month’s winter blasts. While the snow is welcome at New England ski resorts, it’s a headache for some businesses. “I normally have 15 to 20 dogs for day care but that’s down to half a dozen; people can’t get here,” said Bruce Billings, owner of Canine College and Bow Wow Resort, a dog training, day care and boarding center in Holbrook, Massachusetts, 10 miles south of Boston. Billings said he’s trying to clear outdoor play areas with a snow blower because only the biggest dogs can frolic through snow that’s 2-3 feet deep. “I love snow, I just hate having to clear it,” Billings said. Boston’s transit system, the nation’s oldest, has been particularly hard hit. The buildup of snow and ice on trolley tracks combined with aging equipment has stalled trains in recent days, delaying and angering commuters. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority general manager Beverly Scott said Saturday that crews were doing everything they could, including deploying massive jet-powered snow blowers, to clear tracks before the next storm.ust hard hit.
