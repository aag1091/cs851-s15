As Obama Promised: Tens of Thousands of Coal Jobs DestroyedIt was all a part of the plan from the beginning. Obama even admitted as much back in 2008 when he promised that energy costs were going to necessarily skyrocket. Here’s what he said:“So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can; it’s just that it will bankrupt them, because they’re going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that’s being emitted. Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket. Even regardless of what I say about whether coal is good or bad. Because I’m capping greenhouse gases, coal power plants, you know, natural gas, you name it — whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to, uh, retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.”As a result, jobs were going to be lost because of increasing regulations that would cripple certain sectors of the energy industry, including coal. Ever since Obama took office, he’s stayed true to his promise of bankrupting the coal industry. Tens of thousands of coal jobs have been lost. But it was all for a good cause: to hand the monopolistic reins over to the “green” industry to save the planet from global warming. The Daily Caller reported:AAF argues that over regulation by the EPA and other agencies has burdened the coal industry with billions of dollars in regulatory costs in new clean air and water regulations. Economy-wide AAF argues that for every $1 billion in regulatory costs, industries shed an average of 8,100 jobs.
