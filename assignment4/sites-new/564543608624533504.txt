Creating beautiful and practical art for the stylish home and unique giftsHandmade Fused Glass Coasters Each set of coasters comes wrapped in a ribbon - perfect for a gift. These make quite a statement in a room, whether on the coffee table or in the kitchen, bedroom or boardroom. Each coaster is approximately 10cm x 10cm in size and no two are ever the same. Due to popular demand most of my makes are commissions these days, so if there are no coasters for general sale I would love to create one or more especially for you. Prices from £7.50. For ideas pop over to my 'Glasspirations Gallery' page to see the coasters I have previously designed.(Click on picture for more details)Adventurine CoastersPrice £15.00Tea for Two CoastersPrice £15.00Hint of AfricaPrice £15.00Art Deco CoasterPrice £15.00Memories in Sepia IIPrice £15.00Add some sparkle to your life with this set of 2 handmade coasters.
