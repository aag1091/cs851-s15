The ability to identify one’s own emotions is called emotional intelligence. But it’s not enough just to identify emotions; they must be expressed appropriately.In ancient times, disobedience to God had resulted in the Israelites’ exile to Babylonia and the destruction of Jerusalem. After years in exile, a man named Nehemiah received word that his fellow Israelites were returning to Jerusalem. This was joyful news, but Nehemiah was also told that the city was in great disrepair—just a pile of rubble, really. “When I heard these things,” Nehemiah says, “I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.”[1]Nehemiah allowed himself to grieve over the condition of his homeland. Instead of suppressing his painful emotions, he identified the source of the pain and allowed himself to weep and mourn—a crucial part of the healing process.Consider This:What emotions are you experiencing today?What are the sources of those emotions?In what ways are you allowing yourself to express those emotions appropriately?Are there emotions that you are attempting to suppress?Take Action:Make a list of the painful events you have chosen to attempt to suppress.
