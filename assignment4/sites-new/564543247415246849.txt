On Goodreads and Questions PosedI’m writing this Sunday post as I drink my coffee, in my Star Wars I Am Your Father Darth Vader mug, to say thank you to everyone who is purchasing / promoting Shotglass Memories: A Novel. It’s only just begun, people have only started reading, but its surpassed my expectations in what I’m still considering the day one preview launch.I also want to shout out to the writers of #promocave on Twitter. This week has exposed me to a countless number of creative people with such varied backgrounds. It’s been overwhelming. That’s not good or bad and both. I’ve described it as the feeling I got while watching Interstellar and realizing how small my place in the greater scheme of things is. Small isn’t bad. It just means focusing and that’s a very good thing. So thank you all for following me this week, and sharing what I tweet out. It’s helped me significantly and I look forward to getting to know you all better in the years to come.It’s an interesting / great feeling hearing from readers who haven’t lived with these characters like I have. They’re coming in with nothing more than what I’ve posted here or talked about on social media (Read The Wolves Are At the Door for why that’s significant). They don’t know what’s on page or what’s ahead. But to hear their questions and the interesting take on the characters, that only adds to the many layers, is fascinating. Speaking of which, take a look at the web of intrigue graphic, above, I made while in the process of writing the book. My answer has been: add that to any review you write because that’s fascinating. Because of the nature of the book, something such as is “Joe a good role model for Marvin?” is up to the reader to decide, and there isn’t a right or wrong answer.Thank you all and have a great week. It’s Sunday. Cozy up to a warm book if you can.
