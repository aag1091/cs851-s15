Aries & Libra: both get bored easily and need constant stimulationTaurus & Scorpio: both extremely possessive and overly determinedGemini & Sagittarius: both careless and tend to say inappropriate things Cancer & Capricorn: both too self-protective and wary of othersLeo & Aquarius: both are very stubborn and need to have their wayVirgo & Pisces: both care too much and sacrifice themselvesaries, gemini and sagittarius would join for the thrill of it. for the unknown.libra, virgo, scorpio and pisces would want to learn everything magical.leo would be invited to be the next supreme. because every coven needs one.capricorn and cancer would be needed there, to keep everyone out of trouble.aquarius and taurus, skeptical and curious at the same time would want to see how that coven thing works.Because the 12 tropical zodiac signs do not change with time. they’re determined by the static segment of the sky that the sun is in at the time of birth. they have not now, nor have ever, had any bearing on actual constellations (ophiuchus is JUST a constellation).they were only named after certain constellations. but that’s it.we have 12 signs and will always only have 12 signs, corresponding to 12 sky segments, because they are based on the number of lunar cycles in an average year and are marked by the solstices and equinoxes.long story short. the 12 zodiac signs correspond to the seasons, NOT constellations.
