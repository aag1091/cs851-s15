02.08.15Summary: An interlude calling for additional evidence and a roundup of things to comeFOLLOWING our coverage of the Ivan Kabalin case we intend to delve deeper into the corrupt affairs of SIPO, the Croatian roots of the EPO’s current (for now) Vice-President, Željko Topić. As opposition grows from within and outside the EPO, including some coverage from German newspapers, Danish papers etc. we don’t expect the EPO to last in its current form. It’s an utter turmoil and this isn’t due to anything other than bad conduct (if not misconduct) from the EPO’s management.We recently received a lot of SIPO material by E-mail and we invite readers to add to our body of supportive evidence so that we can carry on shedding light on what Topić has been trying to suppress. If you choose to send material by E-mail, please consider using Tor or some other anonymising software for increased protection. The EPO's own Stasi Unit, for example, wrongly assumes that material comes from EPO staff. It has a track record of harassing people whom it views as detrimental to the management’s façade. █Share this post:These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.More news about Intellectual Ventures, Microsoft's and Bill Gates' anti-Linux tool, who lost a battle because of last year's SCOTUS ruling and is now groomed by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)The corporate media and Web sites or people who are funded by large corporations have essentially suppressed any debate about issues in the patent granting process, thereby guarding software patents and preventing criticism of large corporations' power grabThe USPTO, much like FISA (notorious court for surveillance/espionage authorisation), has become a rubber-stamping operation rather than a patents examination centre, as new evidence and old evidence serve to showMore of that awkward shifting of the patent debate towards small actors who are misusing patents, not large conglomerates like Apple and Microsoft which use patents to destroy competitors, crush startups, drive up prices, and so on
