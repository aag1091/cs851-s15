The fastest Premier League playersDiego Costa – 21.56mphThe Chelsea striker has topped a lot of lists since making his £32million switch from Atletico Madrid last summer. Costa has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water, with his 14 league goals seeing him join Sergio Aguero atop the scoring charts in his debut season. More surprisingly however, he just sneaks into the top 10 here, as a result of the 21.56mph he clocked in November’s 2-1 win over Liverpool. His second half finish proved to be the winner that day at Anfield, as has been the case more often than not this campaign. Praised for his clinical finishing, bullish attitude and tireless work rate, blistering pace isn’t one of the main attributes that immediately springs to mind when considering the Spain international, but on this evidence, it seems that defenders have yet another thing to be worried about.
