Kasabian open show at BAFTA Film Awards 2015 backed by string sectionKasabian opened the show at the BAFTA Film Awards tonight (February 8) backed by a string section.The band performed 'Stevie' for a star-studded audience at London's Royal Opera House including Benedict Cumberbatch, David Beckham, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Captain America star Chris Evans and Whiplash actor JK Simmons.All of Kasabian wore black tie for the occasion, with the exception of Serge Pizzorno, who took to the stage in his signature white T-shirt and skeleton jeans.Kasabian's performance at the BAFTA Film Awards follows their recent criticism of another major British awards ceremony, the Brits. The band picked up no nominations for this year's Brit Awards, despite releasing new album '48:13' in 2014 and headlining Glastonbury, prompting Serge Pizzorno to suggest that there is a "conspiracy" by the Brits to "shut rock n' roll out".Speaking about the band's BAFTA Film Awards performance at the end of last month (January), Pizzorno said: "It's a huge honour to open the BAFTAS because we're all such great film fans. It'll be a strange old show playing in front of a load of penguins, but it's going to be great. We're going to start the night off with a huge explosion. We're going to play everything twice as loud. Half the people there won't have a clue what is going on."
