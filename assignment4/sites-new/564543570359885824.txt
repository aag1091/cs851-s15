Photos & Review1 of 9Rockwood Music Hall is a tiny little club nestled in the heart of the East Village that delivers intimate concerts of five or six performances a night, every night. Fans repeat what a pleasure it is seeing their favorite performers in this cozy venue that despite its size keeps bustling all week long. There is no cover charge, just a one drink minimum; come in time for Happy Hour on Thursdays and Fridays from 4p-6p.
