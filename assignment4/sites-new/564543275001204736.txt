Her story is featured in the critically acclaimed documentary Out in the Night which explores the charges and conviction of Renata and three other women (labeled by the media as the New Jersey Four) for fighting back against a man who attacked them on a street in New York in 2006. The film examines how race, sexual orientation and gender violence affect ideas about safety and self-defense. After her release, she worked with the HWWP (Hour Working Women Program) in the mentoring department in Long Island City, mentoring young children and teens who are affected due to the absence of an incarcerated parent. She speaks publicly about her experience with violence, prison, her life's challenges and accomplishments on panels, at universities, in the media, and is touring film festivals in support of Out in the Night which has been awarded several festival jury and audience awards since its world premiere in June 2014.
