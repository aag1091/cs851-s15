(A note that didn't make it in the video: The pepper pieces are actually different thicknesses corresponding to the levels of pepper hotness in the game. So a Level 2 pepper can only be grown by crossing two Level 1 peppers. This formula is visually portrayed in the table - that did make it in the video.)
