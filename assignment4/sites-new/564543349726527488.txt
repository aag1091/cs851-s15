He told the meeting the judicial inquiry would investigate whether his political rivals in the party and senior police had spread false rumours about his personal life, and about his knowledge of the investigation into the former police commissioner John McRoberts, who resigned last month.At the meeting Mr Giles suggested Mr McRoberts was also the target of the alleged whispering campaign."I have good evidence that this has involved an orchestrated political coup to get rid of the police commissioner, the former one," Mr Giles said."The judicial inquiry will have a look at it. If I find that there is evidence they'll go, and I'll take them to court."I will never work with Lambley again: GilesAt the meeting Mr Giles directly accused his now sacked education minister Robyn Lambley of being one of the politicians responsible for spreading false rumours about him.Ms Lambley crunched the numbers for last week's leadership challenge."I sacked Robyn because the things that Robyn had said about me ... and the accusations I found to be horrendous and I will never work with that woman again," he said.But last Tuesday in the midst of the leadership turmoil, Mr Giles changed his tune."This is at a time when there are rumours being spread about myself to try and destabilise me, the chattering class through he upper echelons of the police force making allegations in regards to that police investigation - well the judicial inquiry will go and have a look at that," he said.Mr Giles survived last week's leadership challenge by refusing to resign as leader even after he had lost the support of the majority of his colleagues on Monday night.Some ministers are poor performers: GilesIn a wide-ranging discussion with his Alice Springs branch, Mr Giles offered a free character assessment about some of those on his team, even his close ally and former deputy Dave Tollner, whom he mostly praised."I'll tell you right now, Tolly, as much as I like him, he will not come to a parliamentary wing meeting," Mr Giles said."He says, 'you're all a bunch of idiots except for Adam, I'm not going to work with you'."Mr Giles told the meeting he respected all his colleagues and wanted to get on with the job but he said some of his ministers were poor performers."One in particular refuses to do ABC interviews, refuses to do FM interviews in Darwin," he said.Mr Giles said the MLA also "refuses to travel within the Territory, refuses to go to CLP party meetings, refuses to doorknock, refuses to go to Aboriginal communities, which are a big part of how we get re-elected"."So I upped them and now they want to get rid of me because I upped them."
