I come from a family of men who are incredibly gifted at carpentry and building their own pieces of furniture. My uncle Ron built our family a table, and if you gave my uncle Edward a hammer, he was basically unstoppable.Somehow, that gift was not passed on to me, but I can definitely appreciate the crafty people who like to do things in a “DIY” kind of way.The Roekers are a family of crafters and DIY-ers, and they blog about it here. When we saw one of their projects on Pinterest, we just had to share it with you. Their work is truly impressive.
