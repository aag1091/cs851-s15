Meet Steffi! This girl really needs our help as she has special needs that are causing her pretty face to be overlooked again and again.Steffi is deaf.This doesn’t mean she has any less love to give. It does mean she needs someone special who is willing to gain her trust and work hard with her, but just look at her. She’s beautiful.“This gorgeous Jack Russell Terrier mix came to Animal Aid as a stray back in October. Our dog trainer Michelle has been working with this sweet girl for many weeks, as Steffi is deaf and has particular training needs that are more involved than with most dogs. Steffi is very smart and always willing to please. We are looking for an experienced dog owner to give this beautiful girl a chance. Steffi is very selective about her canine friends and has difficulty getting along with other animals and may need to be an only pet.There will be challenges, but once a strong bond is created, Steffi will follow your lead. Structure and guidance is needed to create strong communication and once this is achieved the possibilities are endless! If you would like to find out more about Steffi, please speak to our shelter kennels team or pop in for a visit.”Animal aid is located in Coldstream, Victoria. The friendly staff there can be contacted by phone on 03 9739 0300, or you can drop over to their website here for a wealth of information about pet adoption.

I'm an Aussie veterinarian and blogger. Working in partnership with loving pet owners to ensure their fur-kids remain happy, healthy family members life-long is what brings me joy. Well, that and taking naps. I strongly believe that helping to maintain the wonderful bond between a pet and it's human is reason enough for a happy dance. More about me here
