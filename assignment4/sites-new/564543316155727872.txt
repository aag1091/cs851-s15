Carbon Tax was only really electricity. Yet they want GST on everything.GST shifts the tax burden from the rich to the middle Class and poor.

Tell me about those "flow on" savings? When & where?I'll give you an example, the local council here on the Sunny Coast raised the price of dumping "green" from $9 to $15 citing the CT. I bought a trailer load there the other day, low & behold it was still $15. I raised this with the cashier & to my astonishment, he claimed that the increase had nothing to do with CT...... no, just a 66% increase because of "increased cost" .... yeah right!!!CommenterLeftyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:38PMWell it's all over.

Indulge me. Three weeks ago I ordered a very expensive piece of white goods for a "top" provider. I needed delivered on a certain day, all was guaranteed - which i checked and triple checked. Yep. didn't turn up. On one knew anything about it. So, guaranteed for first thing this morning. Failed. Promises for tomorrow! OK, so maybe that's what you expect from that sector. How about health care? I'm on warfarin. Need regular checks. Time after time I am told wrong dosages because on one bothers to read my file. If I were not alert to the correct levels (which you get the hang of after 15 years ) it could be disaster. Complain and get treated like a pariah.I'm in an inner city bayside suburb but Optus signal fails repeatedly. I pity the poor people in the country areas - pay through the nose and get ignored. Compare that to the US where I spend a lot of time. Nothing's too much trouble. One third the price and three times the quality. Except for politics which is even more diabolical than here. The couldn't care less attitude will see us go down badly. Tony Abbott is a perfect example of all that is wrong, blame everyone else and keep the hand out.CommenterAlbert ParkDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:31PMI disagree, the nation owes Abbott and his government thanks.More people are engaging, more people are debating and arguing, more people are thinking about how they vote than at any time I can remember since Gough happened (yes, he was an event as well as a person).This is a very good thing for the long term interests of our social democracy.CommenterWhatevayareckonLocationTerror AustralisDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:44PMWhateveryareckonI too think along your lines.

But even if you survive, I didn't get it.I voted for you on the basis of your word. I did not expect your budget last year to break so many promises. I did not expect that it would contain measures like welfare, education and medical changes which suggest the philosophical spirit of WorkChoices beats within the heart of the current cabinet. And this from one who leans to the free market side of things.Further, I expected that policy would be adult...that is, well considered and implementable. I always thought you were a good minister under Howard. Would you have put your name to some of the sloppy work handed in by some of your senior ministers?Right now my plan is to do my bit to vote you out next election (and I live in a marginal, my vote can make a difference). Maybe you can turn it round, but it will take actions, not promises. Because you didn't keep the last lot.Let's see how the next budget looks.

The electorate doesn’t want them, their policies are rubbish, they cannot control the budget, they won’t take on tax reform; they continue to indulge tax evasion scams by conglomerates; they refuse to address the lack of equitability in the superannuation scheme; coal although a toxin of many varieties is supposedly good for humanity. The Aged are condemned to peasantry; the NDIS is all but scrapped; meanwhile religion in schools remains funded by $245 million; there is budget emergency that isn’t; so we are to spend almost $70 billion on 58 fighter planes; and 61% of them voted for the insanity’s continuance.Well if its fantasy and delusion you want then by God you have got it in abundance.CommenterPen of hrbaDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:10PM@Pen. Simple fact of the matter is Gillard's carbon tax wasn't well received by the electorate. You can't change history or facts. Abbott's unpopularity has nothing to do with climate change or coal as much as you and the other progressives try and spin it.CommenterPiped PiperDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:16PMThat may be true, Piped, but there are those who voted for the LNP who are now seeing how much they were lied to on so many things, one of which being the so-called cost of the carbon price. The magic pudding $550 savings have never eventuated, so the "benefit" of removing the measure for the average punter is also a myth, and with climate change becoming a key focus overseas you can bet it wouldn't be the major area of differentiation here any more. Abbott is so one-dimensional he will delusionally have that as a main election platform in 2016 - and will gain zero traction.CommenterBCDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:46PMpiper - don't equate the CT issue with lack of desire for CC action.

Just more meaningless rhetoric that he will live to regret as blind Freddie can see it isn't workable .

Surely they are not that stupid are they? After all according to Sky News he has promised a more collegiate and consultative government 15 times since 2009 and they just had a spill over that same issue.This government is looking dumber and dumber.CommenterLanceDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:17PMRTP you are implying Abbott has credibility.

Nana democracy wants us all to ride the austerity period.CommenterIron MaidenDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:00PMNo my read is not that it is selfishness that is the issue, it is in most cases the opposite - a sense of fairness and care towards those who can least afford to do all the lifting and by those directly affected, a reasonable self interest - such as, if I am an under 30 unemployed person, how can I survive for 6 months or if I have a chronic illness but am a low income earner, how can I afford to go to the doctor as often as needed?And false premise in any event IM, in that the mommy in this case was (mostly) the LNP under Howard with his middle class welfare and the consecutive unsustainable (in the long term) tax cuts.There is no rule that says austerity must follow prosperity, except in LNP land - where the script is to take back from the punters the wealth amassed during any good times, keeping the LNP natural order of the little people being in their proper (poor and exploitable) place.You just haven't got it have you IM, that the public's is not on the whole disputing the need for some structural balance in the budget, it is how it is done, that the way the LNP has tried to go about it is either unfair or they have not really gone about it at all (ie using the GP tax not to balance the budget but create a huge medical research fund which will be a boondoggle for the ticket clippers)CommenterLynDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:48PMDadda LNP got all lazy and generous during the mining boom, handing out cheques, neglecting health and education when there was money to act, all for that fuzzy feelgood feeling you get from being elected.CommenterPercyLocationCanberraDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 1:09PMIron Maiden,fail to understand history or economics and you will relive the past.the great depression was 5 years of government austerity that drove all nations deeper into depression & deflation.Governments are for the people, current and future. It does no good to smash the wealth of the nation with a depression or recession; it creates nothing but an accountants nirvana.Governments are there to maintain law & order, prosperity, growth and property rights. They are there to 'balance the books' over 20-year cycles, not one-term of government. All governments have to work on 20 year cycles and that means debt when needed and surpluses when needed. We do not need a surplus now without damaging today and tomorrow.CommenterEconoratLocationSydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 3:03PMA poll earlier today showed that among Labor voters Turnbull had 83% support to 9% over Mr Abbott, while Liberal supporters backed Mr Abbott by 54% to 40%. The reason Turnbull failed today is why Rudd was removed; neither represent the true power base and interests of their parties, which represent two opposed minorities in Australia, and which is why we so many moderate Australians swing back and forth from Labour to Liberal or drift off to the independents. The failed spill today shows loyalty to the Liberal Party.CommenterChrisLocationSydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:57AMYou are correct about that. But what does it mean in effect?The primary vote is way down, but it's not the base that's walking away.

With the inclusion of 'Investor State Dispute Settlement' (ISDS) clauses, these are a potential time bomb for Australia. Labor wouldn't sign with such problematic clauses. A Robb and Abbott sellout.CommenterD MartinLocationMelbDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:50PMWhy Tony Abbott should retain his position as Prime Minister.Shortly after being elected, Abbott immediately reneged on a number of election promises, citing that he was elected based on the central theme of fixing the budget. The Abbott government has not “fixed” the budget, they have, in fact, added to Australia’s debt. This has occurred despite enforcing more inhumane asylum seeker (illegal immigrant for those of you who think trying to escape war and persecution is illegal) processing measures and attempts to tax Australians who are most vulnerable, her students, her sick and her poor.However, these mistakes are not Abbott’s alone. They are the machinations of a party of people, some of whom are undoubtedly more suited at the helm of the Liberal party. At the end of World War 2, the Allies stopped trying to assassinate Hitler because they recognised that he was doing more harm than good. The Liberal Party has no possible chance to win the next election under Tony Abbott. Australians are too smart for that.CommenterAlexLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:54AMthat Dennis "the Menace" Jensen sure is the go to man for spills - he motioned the spill motion against Turnbull in 2009Commenterrod steigerLocationtoukleyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:54AMNow Lamming has joined the conga line of back-flippers.Pathetic.CommenterA country galDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:53AMTeresa Gambaro's words of the past couple of days are the most telling I've seen.CommenterWhatevayareckonLocationTerror AustralisDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 12:01PMYes, most telling.

His political immolation is now in the hands of his own party, and they will do him over in good time (at the moment they're all running about trying to save their own necks), but it is the policy platform of the LNP that needs to have the greater attention - never let the people of Australia forget that the last election gave us a government of unfairness and self-indulgence.The ALP needs to take THAT to an election, not the personal popularity (or otherwise) of the then PM.CommenterBCDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:41AMThe Liberal Party's problem is NOT just Abbott – t is the almost total absence of 'talent' anywhere in the party, or on the front bench. This has been the best result for Malcolm Turnbull — one of the few who does have a bit of 'talent' and a few principles. Had the spill motion succeeded and he put himself forward and become leader, because of the lack of talent he would have to choose from, he'd probably only be Prime Minister for the rest of this term of government, another 18 months? It's not just the present leader that is the problem. It is the entire conservative side of politics.The Labor Party has much the same problem – a general lack of talent – although my assessment is that there are a few more with principles there than. The whole situation is indicative of a major shift that's gone on in politics generally in recent decades – the move of a specific sub-class of what might be dubbed "professional or career politicians" into our parliaments. Politics is increasingly seen as a place for personal advancement and it has lost a sense of noblesse oblige — the sense of entering public life out of a sense of "giving back to society" for the benefits society has given to oneself, one's family or one's class.Turnbull, if he would like to be remembered as an admired leader in Australian politics ought "sit back" wait for Abbott to completely screw everything up, let Labor return, and spend the time trying to re-build the Liberal Party with a few people of principle rather than a party of dopes who all see themselves as clever but essentially they are not and are there mainly to advance themselves financially, or socially, in life.CommenterBrian CoyneLocationBlue MountainsDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:19AMI couldn't agree more with your observation - too many career focussed politicians and too few conviction politicians.CommenterBlueroomLocationQLDDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:38AMYes indeed PP...JG must be making a comeback according to our Kevin!!CommenterLeftyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:18AMYes indeed PP...JG must be making a comeback according to our Kevin!!CommenterLeftyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:18AMRecall the words of Keating, folks,a man renowned for cracking jokeswell-laced with verbal cyanidethat skewered Coalition pride.Remember Hewson, long ago,when Keating, as his mortal foe,said, aiming to humiliate,“I want to do you slowly, mate!”And now it is Bill Shorten’s turnto instigate the long, slow burn.CommenterGazza from Grong GrongDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:16AMI think even you would agree, Bill Shorten is no Paul Keating, not even closeCommenterscottDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:36AMShorten does not have the ticker.

However Tony has alienated many of the community with personal comments and with making decisions on personal beliefs. Wrong thing to do. It's not about him, it's about the people of Australia. He's not out of the woods and to continue will be devistating. His best course of action right now is to quietly resign and to endorse Julie Bishop as his successor.CommenterDaveLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:06AMThis was not a vote to sort matters out, it was a "cop out".

To give Abbott his dues he dragged the party back to being more than competitive and won an election.So, keep on with the policy free zone and 'pieman' jibes (particularly unfair), and the underestimation. Who knows, you might be right.CommenterdavemacLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:18AMdavemac - The Pieman & Kingslayer jibes relate to matters of historical fact of Shorten's behaviour.

Pieman - pretty rough and petty, the bloke got pissed off and got caught on camera...cut him some slack.CommenterdavemacLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 1:21PMHi davemac - I'm very tempted to remind you that Abbott, at least via these pages, has had no slack cut for him for many years whilst Shorten was a senior member of 2 governments where I'd say the bar of PM'ship standards scarcely moved off the floor. How about a Thomas Covenant term like"Kinslaughterer".CommenterSmackLocationCity of the Blue SupremeDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 1:57PMIts hardly a ringing endorsement. Putting forward the spill motion possibly saved Abbott a few votes. Think of it this way if the parliamentary liberal party was a soccer team 4 o 5 of the 11 on field are either not kicking your way or perhaps gifting the ball to the opposition. Its hard to win when you cant guarantee everyone is happy with the "captain" and agrees with the overall strategy especially when you feel you are not consulted and valued.CommenterGerryLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:40AMI thought we were going to enter a golden age of politics with Turnbull at the helm and we at last have an intelligent leader. I can't stand to listen to Abbott anymore he is such an embarrassment to this country as is Hockey. Very very disappointed. It seems there is a real shortage of intelligent ministers on the liberal side and I cannot vote for the current bunch now after this.

Abbott gets to fight another day, and will get the chance to negotiate with the Senate and deliver a budget to address the nation’s fiscal woes. But if he doesn’t get it right, it’ll be hasta la vista after the winter recess.For Malcolm, he can be the knight in shining armour in that event, and have at least 12 months to prepare for an election, getting one budget under his belt.The immediate future ?

It is interesting to watch the Hacka cogs turning as the inevitable comes to pass.CommenterjofekDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:37AMrod - at 43-57, with Abbott down 40+ points, i suspect the government has hit rock bottom.But all eyes will be on Newspoll and Ipsos over the coming months.CommenterHackaLocationCanberraDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:43AMhacca, i think you underestimate the contempt that is swelling against Sir TonyI am sure he can wring a 60% ALP 40% LieNP out of the electorate given enough time at the mangleCommenterrod steigerLocationtoukleyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:59AMWhat policy discussion was there to get back to - or are you re-writing history again?CommenterChristopherLocationClean SlateDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 2:54PMAn invisible challenger gets 40% of the vote lol...sad old Tony lives another week.CommenterSteedenLocationBallinaDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:01AMThat's the bottom line. Most likely would've been Turnbull but nonetheless an invisible contender/s.Just a matter of time.I'd bet if we didn't have the history of Rudd/Gillard the outcome would've been very different.CommenterA country galDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:13AMBest result for labor, Abbott's days are numbered.CommenterjackDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:01AMBest result for Labor - the agony will be long drawn out. Perhaps even nearly as Rudd - Gillard round 2.CommenterBillRDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:26AMTony Abbott is still the PM. That's the best result Labor could have hoped for.Alright, can the media please stop trying to create drama and let the government govern now.CommenterThoorDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:00AM@ThoorThe wheel has turned. I'm assuming you held the same view during the last term of Government when Julia Gillard was subject to the same endless leadership speculation.CommenterNovacastrianDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:07AMThe media has turned .... on Turnbull. Take a look at Murdoch's papers this morning.Still promoting Abbott as he is Rupert's lacky.Rupert knows Turnbull wouldn't bow to his every demand.Commenterfitzy of kogarahDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:20AMA very apt comment. The SMH is trying to keep the story going by trying to emphasise the division within their ranks.CommenterGraemeDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:59AMNot just the SMHNews is allocating pages and pages to telling their readers that Abbott is a "Dead Man walking"CommenterSteveDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:42AMThe vibe out here in voter land, in my humble opinion, feels similar to the end of the Rudd-Gillard era where people have stopped listening to the government and are just biding their time to take the necessary corrective actions at the next election.Mr Abbott, due to his harping on honesty and consistency and no surprises in opposition, has burned through his political capital in record time.That 60-odd professional politicians can't see this is risible.CommenterOlafDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:59AMNow for question time this is low hanging juicy fruit for the ALP.CommenterHarvest timeDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:58AMApparently Abbott has refused to meet with the media & is only going to grant an interview to Channel 9. Utter cowardice.CommenteryoulotsDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:58AMThe SMH & media generally love negativity!The headline should be 61 MP's vote for stability.CommenterSteve DLocationNewcastleDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:58AMI thought News' description as "The Walking Dead" was more apt.It is only a matter of time.Unfortunately it is time our economy doesn't have.CommenterSteveDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 11:38AM69 pro-Tony minus 35 cabinet types compelled to vote for him makes 34 independent pro-Tony compared with 39 anti-Tony. Not much of a result and Tony should have stood down immediately.CommenterLong XuyenLocationCairnsDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:57AMACT I is over.Malcolm knew it was too early in the play to stride on to the stage.ACT II yet to come.CommenterSteveH.Date and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:56AMThe government of Australia started the working week at Church?

Some interesting comments about being a true Liberal. Still not sure what it means.How can you espouse Christian values and do the things the Coalition have been doing since elected. Someone should interview him more deeply. That's if he's allowed to talk to the media again.Why should a Minister have to resign for just thinking about the leadership. Well I suppose having certain thoughts is a sin !CommenterRodLocationthe CoastDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:56AMYes I did Rod.Cringeworthy!How many times did he state integrity, values etcAnd call for Mal's resignation.At least Mal does have some modern and egalitarian values unlike feudal Bernardi.No big Mal fan but given those two in a contest Mal wins hands down.CommenterA country galDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:08AMSenators tend to say whatever they want without repercussion. He is a big part of the current problem with the Liberal Party. People hear what he and people like Abetz say and presume it is part of the 'Liberal way"CommenterbzzzLocationSydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:13AMGreat, Now let's see how many more mistakes he makes until the next election. Him in power gives labor the best chance of winnning next election.CommenterClarkDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:56AM9:32am. Grinners are winners.CommenterPlutoLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:56AMWhat the LNP miss is that we didn't vote them in, we voted the ALP out at the last election. Abbott was not popular then, nor is he now. What I find even more amazing is Bill Shorten talking about LNP party disunity, this is from a man who led the ALP into eating its own young. We need the LNP to ditch Abbott so we don't get Shorten as the PM.CommenterTerryLocationBrisbaneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:56AMtoo late!Commenterrod steigerLocationtoukleyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:59AMI use them same argument everytime someone claims that Abbott should stay in as te public elected him.The major difference between the knifing of Rudd and this is that Rudd had huge popularity with the public and the party was polling well. The other difference is that the LNP got into govt. due to a protest vote, whereas the ALP got in because they ran a solid campaign with good policies and vision for the future.CommenterLet's make sandwichesLocationWollongongDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:16AMWe? I voted Liberal. Had I known I could have voted labor out I would have done that too.Do I need to wait until they are in again before I vote them out?CommenterDannoLocationBrisbaneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 2:33PMDennis Shannahan of the Australian is calling this spill result a "fatal blow" for Abbott.Hmmm I wonder when Ruperts going to tweet his "electronic graffitti" opinion of all these shenigans in Canberra?CommentermirrorsofsmokeLocationsydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:55AMNow can you media types please stop reporting on noise. You've had your dose of self indulgence this week.CommenterAggie57Date and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:55AMMay be noise for you Aggie57 but it's sweet music knowing "Sir" Captain Abbott is eating humble pie. He alone caused all of this himself with his arrogance and failing to listen to his mates in cabinet.CommenterSBLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:02AMAggie57 - how is it noise?Liberal MPs moved a spill motion on their own. It's not like we had newpaper front pages declaring it was time to vote Abbott out or anything?CommenterOliver MoreDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:05AMIt's noise because its largely irrelevant in the scheme of things. Last time it was Labor, this time its the Libs, next time do we assume Libs again or maybe Labor? Quite frankly who really cares.CommenterAggie57Date and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:17AMSorry, Aggie57, but what you saw as 'noise' I saw as an opportunity for the government to elect a new captain capable of stearing our country away from the looming iceberg.I guess one man's music really is someone else's noise.CommenterOliver MoreDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:37AMIt's only a matter of time before Abbot is gone. Turnbull and Bishop et al. will be quietly gathering numbers as we speak.CommenterIt's TimeLocationSydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:55AMTo some, this may sound like a good combination, if we have to turn Chair and Deputy Chair into A-Listers. But this is the LNP - Morrison and Abetz/Pyne is much more likely.CommenterChristopherLocationClean SlateDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 2:40PMI cannot think of a greater unearned gift to the Labor Party!!!!!!!!CommenterThe Time TravellerLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:54AM....to leave the gate open for the voters to give Abbott and his useless minions the royal order of the boot.CommenterMPDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:19AMThis is a flawed secret ballot process. 101 people squashed into a small room who must right down yes or no on a piece of paper with everybody breathing down each others necks. No secrecy there.Abbotts gone. 61 - 35 who were forced through cabinet solidarity means real numbers are 22 against spill - 39 for the spill.Abbotts politically a dead man walking. Straight away a minimum 40% do not support Abbott in any way.Cowardly Abbott is not doing a press conference - what does that mean?Will he resign? he should.CommenterpunchDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:54AMInteresting to know who voted informal. Might read about it in a memoir after they are trounced 2016.CommenterA country galDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:21AMNow comes the Bernardi-led crusade against the sane. The knives will be out to purge the heretics.Only 39 for the spill? Anything over 30 is a disaster for the incumbent, but it proves that the problem is not the leader, it's the party. Over half think he's doing a great job, Knighthoods and all. It's only the certain prospect of being unemployed after 2016 that unsettles them.Anyone who thinks the LNP might be worth voting for when they finally turf TA - remember this vote. The LNP has gone off the rails, they're now the caricatures the ALP falsely claimed they were.CommenterZoe BrainLocationCanberraDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:54AMAh well...

Ley not happy over Medicare debacle. Her absence telling.CommenterA country galDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:55AMDefinitely a bitter-sweet outcome – Bitter that Abbott will continue his failed and rejected, economically damaging, socially unpalatable agenda of Tea Party policies, but sweet that it guarantees a total destruction of the far-right of the LNP at the next election. Turnbull then has time to re-build the LNP without the bad taste of Abbott’s total failure.CommenterQEDDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:52AMTo all of the Australians who feel cheated; "You can't change a leopard's spots!"CommenterCheatedLocationSydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 4:07PMNow playing in a cinema near you.. 2016 Apocalypse liberal party. Too funny, Worst thing is Bill Shorten just won the next election a year and a smidge out without having to run a election campaign.Labor will save a fortune on the next election. The good thing is we get to watch Tony Abbott spew more of the dogs breakfast up.. My most favorite thing in the world to watch.. Hey Hacka Got your Mojo back yet?CommenterRidgeyDidgeLocationVicDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:51AMWhatever happened today is simply a representation of the samsara of political processes. There is no precedent with spill motion outcome but we can only speculate. Howard survived many contests and defied all critics and media circus against all odds. Howard made a mockery of Lazarus by having gone through many political reincarnations.With Vic, Qld, & SA to ALPs camp, it is hard to say if NSW follows. M Baird is not a bad bloke but can one bloke save LNPs unpopularity. M Baird is like M Turnbull – an ALP façade but LNP in soul.Agree that LNP doesn’t don’t have the knifing, stabbing conventions ALP surpassed but this does not detract the fact that LNPs politicking is just same coin but different sides to ALP. Both parties excel at politicking but neither works for Australia’s best interest.What is admirable however is Abbott’s resilience. Is it a display of a political conviction or power driven? Mr P Sheehan’s voice trembles now with displeasure, Ms A Vanstone quivers with criticism to a man down but when a man is down and he gets kick in the face and stood up, I’d say he has my respect.Mr Abbott wants to make it right, he fights a fight that all of us may not agree to but for a man who stands with the courage that he has, I’d say as a man he has won already standing up. Give him his term, give him the Lodge – he fought hard, the least we can do is to let a man stand proud.Mr Abbott deserves a political reincarnation. To Abbott's mind, his Australia is worth fighting for.CommenterPostgirlDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:51AMThe Lodge is being renovated, just like the spinmeisters are attempting to renovate the Very Good Team Captain.Quite the contrary about earning respect and being strong- its hubris pure and simple, his birthright to be a PM or a Pope according to Mum.CommenterA country galDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:01AMJust getting over the man standing proud line.But, what is Abbott's Australia isn't what the vast majority of the country want? A country operating in this century for starters....CommenterdavemacLocationMelbourneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:03AMWe are all victims to our own hubris at some point in our lives but the greatest challenge in life is how to grow stronger, to bend and plow ahead. It is foolish not to see the good in someone but even a fool can be right sometimes.As for the lodge, I think Mr Abbott prefers a $110/night accommodation but he soon earns the right to enjoy the Lodge after the renovations.CommenterPostgirlDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:15AM@davemacIf I am wrong, merely indulging with sentiments, I'll give you a bottle of Grange courtesy of Barr O'Farrell.Mr Abbott remains a leader of Australia but with severely wounded aorta from the Republic of Public Opinion.If the economy is to revive him in our favor, in our fickle opinions and sentiments, the shifting poles of public opinion may surprise us even.CommenterPostgirlDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:22AMWhat would be good is if Mr. Abbott understood what he needed to change and do it.CommenterXeraphaxDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:51AMSo the people who really lose out here are the...people of AustraliaNot that changing 'leaders' would necessarily have helped.CommenterTerrifficDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:50AMWhy doesn't the headline state - "61 MP's vote against change" ???CommenterLarryLocationSydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:50AMOr "61 MPs coerced into signing up with Abbott, or lose your job"CommenterPBLocationSydneyDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:57AMFor the same reason that when earlier PMs won the first round of leadership this was seen as temporary.Only a squaddie such as yourself would see those numbers as an endorsement.CommenterBCDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 10:14AMHa, the LNP is going to get wiped out at the next election.To right wing to be able to tolerate a centrist like Turnbull.CommentermarkLocationozDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:50AM39 of his own colleagues have voted for anyone else but Abbott ... dead man walking.CommenterNovacastrianDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 9:49AMThat's one way of looking at it. Another way is that 39 people voted to "have a vote". Many of them would be wanting a vote just to put this crazy story the left have concocted to bed.CommenterDannoLocationBrisbaneDate and timeFebruary 09, 2015, 1:22PMHow do you work out it is not finishedIn 2009 Abbott beat Turnbull by only 42 to 41. Since that slim victory he has lasted 5 years during which time he did very well in the 2010 election and won the 2013 election. So now he wins this vote 61 to 39 and that's not enough. He also has the support of 20 or so Nationals so that is 81 or 82 support to 39 in the government Coalition.I spoke to my local Liberal MP and he was getting emails at around 20 to 1 in support for not changing the PM. So it seems MPs listening to their constituents. It doesn't fit with the narrative of the Abbott haters but they are one element of our society. Not the whole.
