Education BlogDallas ISD announced today that it has put a plan in place to focus on professional conduct, following the ouster of the district’s human resources chief and one of her executives over instant messages that disparaged their co-workers.Superintendent Mike Miles also plans to review the communications of directors and above, starting in human resources, “to determine if there are other individuals or areas of concern in terms of inappropriate messages shared among staff.”Carmen Darville, chief of Human Capital Management, and executive director Jose “Tony” Munoz, resigned Thursday after The Dallas Morning News obtained instant messages in which they poked fun at race, religion and old age, while disparaging co-workers and discussing ways to get rid of employees.Miles sent a written and videotaped message to district employees today on a plan to “reinforce high expectations of conduct.”“The recent events do serve as a powerful reminder that all of us need to strive to meet the highest standards of professionalism and integrity, and that the district needs to do even more to support and foster such a culture,” Miles said in a news release. “Thus, we will take this opportunity to put a plan in place that reinforces those high standards.”Part of the plan includes:*Immediately updating the district’s orientation training on professional conduct for new employees, as well as conducting training for central office staff, princpals, and assistant principals over the summer.*Reviewing office functions and procedures in human resources, including assembling a task force to review progress made over the last two years as recommended by a commission of human resource professionals across the region.*Continue to develop a new evaluation instrument for central staff that emphasizes professional conduct and behavior, with a goal to have it in place by the start of next school year.The district’s announcement of the plan comes just hours before school board members meet in closed session to discuss the human resources controversy. Some trustees disagree with the handling of the issue — such as Miles’ decision to pay Darville a settlement of at least $55,000 and $22,000 for Munoz.Trustee Dan Micciche said Monday that he plans to propose changes to district policy that would require board approval to give settlements for departing employees.The instant messages were among evidence collected by former DISD investigator Vickie Blair and outlined in a Dec. 18 letter that alleged possible improper recruiting practices, falsified records, retaliatory terminations, nepotism and harassment in the human resources department.The Dec. 18 letter, which Blair said she wrote on chief internal auditor Mike Singleton’s behalf, was addressed to trustees but was never sent. Blair said she quit in early January because she didn’t feel the district would properly support investigating high-ranking administrators.Singleton gave copies of some of Darville’s messages to Miles in early January, but Miles didn’t ask Darville to resign until Thursday when The News obtained them.Top PicksCommentsTo post a comment, log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.
