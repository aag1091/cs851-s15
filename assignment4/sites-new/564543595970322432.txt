TDA7594 general description:The Type IC TDA7294 from SGS-Thomson is an integrated a.f. amplifier intended for use in all sorts of hi-f application. According to the manufacturer's data sheets, chip can deliver outputs of up to 100 watt. Considering other properties, such as low noise, low distortion and reliable short-circuit and thermal protection circuits as well, the chip is indeed an interesting one. Moreover, with peak supply voltages of ±40 V and a load impedance of 4 ohm, the maximum dissipation of the IC TDA7294 will easily be exceeded. For these reasons, the supply in the present amplifier has been kept down to a safe ±30 V. At these voltages, the chip delivers, without any difficulty, 50 W into an 8 ohm load and 80 W into a 4 ohm load. These are still very respectable figures, particularly in view of the reasonable IC price. The circuit diagram of the amplifier in shows that the IC TDA7294 needs only a small number of external components. The input signal is applied to pin 3 via capacitor C1 and low-pass filter R6-C10. The filter improves the pulse response and flattens the frequency response. For maximum output offset, the values of R1 and R3 should be equal, so that the input impedance is 10k. The roll-off frequencies of R1-C1 and R2-C2 determine the lower bandwidth limit of the amplifier: with values a specified, this is about 16 Hz. The upper -3 dB point is at about 100 kHz.The amplifier is muted by a relevant input to pin 10 and placed in the stand-by mode by a relevant signal at pin 9. Muting should always take place before the stand-by mode is selected. Connecting the mute and standby pins permanently to the supply line ensures that the amplifier comes on immediately the power is switched on. Any switch-on clicks may be eliminated by increasing time constants R3-C4 and R5-C5. If large-value electrolyte capacitors are used in the power supply, switching off will be rather slow. It is best to build the amplifier on the printed-circuit board shown below. Insulating material between the heat sink and the IS is. The amplifier will have good performance with toroidal mains transformer, a 25A bridge rectifier and two 10.000uf,50 V electrolytic capacitors.TL071 MOSFET Audio Amplifier general description:This simple mosfet power audio amplifier circuit, with TL071 and 2 mosfets (IRF9530, IRF530) power amplifiers can deliver up to 45W on 8 ohm. This schematic is based on Siliconix application and is based on variations of voltage on the 2 resistors serial inserted on the voltage supplier of the operational amplifier driver. The mosfet transistors must be mounted on a heatsink at least 1K/W. Amplifier efficiency is 70%, distortions at cut frequency were at most 0.2% at 20Hz on 8 ohm and 10W. With a power supply of +/- 30V the mosfet audio amplifier can deliver 45W on 8 ohm and 70w on 4 ohm. Remember that this audio amplifier is not protected on short circuits so every time you switch on check to see if the speaker is connected.MOSFET Audio Amplifier Circuit diagram:Subwoofer Amplifier Circuit 30W description:This circuit with 30w output Power circuit. This Amplifier circuit is very suitable for use in subwoofer amplifier system based on IC SI1030G. Amplifier has 30W output with 8 ohm impedance. Supply voltage required minimum of 12 volts and a maximum of up to 22 volts DC.Audio Amplifier 1000W description:I think you've seen or even have an active speaker and there is written 1500 watts PMPO (Peak Music Power Output), make no mistake this is different from Power Amplifier Active Speaker, I often dismantle such Active Speaker in it only a power with power no more than 150 watts by using the transformer 2-3 Ampere. PMPO is not a real power which is issued by the Power Amplifier, but counting all the speakers that there is, for example: if there are 5 pieces of speakers on each channel and each speaker has a power of 10 W then it is 100 W PMPO.Audio Amplifier 1000W circuit diagram:While this 1000 Watt Power Amplifier minimal use transformer 20 Ampere. And the output of Power AmplifierDC voltage contains approximately 63 volts, with currents and voltages of this magnitude, this 1000 Watt Power Amplifier will not hesitate hesitate to destroy your woofer speakers to connect. To overcome that then before the speaker on connects to 1000 Watt Power Amplifier must be in pairs Speaker Protector.Actually if you want to create a Power Amplifier with great power does not have to make a Power Amplifier with great power. Example: you want to create a Power Amplifier with 10 000 Watt power. You do not have to assemble a Power Amplifier with power of 10,000 watts, but you assemble the power Power Amplifier Small but many, such as you assemble the Power Amplifier with 1000 Watts of power for as many as 10 pieces, it will produce 10 000 Watt Power Amplifier helpless.Audio Amplifier 1000W partsCircuit uses power transistors pair of 5 x 5 x 2SA1216 and 2SC2922 and 2SC1583 use a differential amplifier that actually contains 2 pieces of transistors that are in containers together. Why use such built-in amplifier differental tujuanya so identical / similar, could have uses 2 separate transistors but can result in amplifier so it is not symmetrical.Stereo Power Amplifier 3000W DescriptionThis power amplifier circuit using a transistor amplifier from the front, signal splitter, driver and power amplifier. Current consumption required is quite large power amplifier that is 15-20 A 1500W power amplifier circuits for this. Supply voltage needed by the power of this amplifier is the optimal working order symmetrical 130VDC (130VDC-130VDC ground). 1500W amplifier circuit below is a picture series of mono, stereo if you want to make it necessary to make two copies of the circuit. For more details can be viewed directly image the following 1500W power amplifier circuit. In the above series of power amplifier 1500W is equipped to control a DC Offset function to set the power amplifier is turned on at the moment and with no input signal then the output should be 0VDC. Then also equipped with a flow regulator to the power amplifier bias. Final part of this power amplifier requires adequate cooling to absorb the heat generated. Power amplifier is not equipped with a speaker protector, therefore it is necessary diapsang protector on the speaker output so that when the power amplifier is not the case turned on the beat to the speaker that can damage the speaker.The 1N5404 diodes can withstand a peak non-repetitive current of 200A.Higher rated components may be used if desired. The voltage rating needs to be at least 400V.TDA1562Qgeneral description:Philips designers have further improved a number of properties of the IC, among which the power output. According to the Philips datasheet, the improved device, the TDA1562Q, can deliver 70 watts into 4 ohms, but that is at the cost of the distortion, which at 10 per cent is rather too high, even for in a car. The prototype of the design described in this article provides 54 watts into 4 ohms at 1 per cent distortion. Since the number of requisite external components is smaller than in the case of the earlier device, the printed-circuit board is even more compact than that for the February 1995 amplifier.TDA7560general description:TDA7560 is a 4 x 45W QUAD BRIDGE car audio amplifier plus HSD. The TDA7560’s inputs are ground-compatible and can stand very high input signals (± 8Vpk) without any performances degradation. If the standard value for the input capacitors (0.1mF) is adopted, the low frequency cut-off will amount to 16 Hz. The TDA7560 is a breakthrough BCD (Bipolar / CMOS / DMOS) technology class AB Audio Power Amplifierin Flexiwatt 25 package designed for high power car radio. The fully complementary P-Channel/N-Channel output structure allows a rail to rail output voltage swing which, combined with high output current and minimised saturation losses sets new power references in the car-radio field, with unparalleled distortion performances.
