Hi, my name's Trevor, and I look like Barack Obama. I've had lots of people stop me on the streets, ask me about taxes and healthcare and things like that, and I thought I'd create a website to clarify that I am, in fact, NOT Barack Obama. Please note:I am NOT Barack Obama, we just look alike.We are not in any way related (to the best of my knowledge).I am not the president of the United States.So please, if you see me on the street, don't come up to me asking if I'm Barack Obama. I'm not. He has bodyguards and dresses better. If you're walking down the street, and think you see Barack Obama, WAIT, do not go up to him, because it might just be me.
