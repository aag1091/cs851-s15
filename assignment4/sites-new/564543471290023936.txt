TracksABOUT THIS ALBUMAlbum Notes“Night of the Full Moon” is an enchanting, ethereal, and uplifting piece inspired by the Full Moon on September 19th, 2013. I looked at the full moon that night and got this feeling 'go to the keyboard and record,’ the tunes started flowing out! Just like the moon this space music piece is mysterious, a bit intense, and mildly calming. The Full Moon is well known to have effects on the ocean, nature, and the solar system, including people and their inner conscious.Session Expiration WarningSession ExpirationWe need to talk.The web browser you're using to surf the web is so old it’s embarrassing.
