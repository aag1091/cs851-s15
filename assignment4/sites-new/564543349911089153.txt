COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RELATED COMPLAINTS You may not use the Site for any purpose or in any manner that infringes the rights of any third party. AKW encourages you to report any content on the Site that you believe infringes your rights. Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content. If you have a good faith belief that content on the Site infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please follow the procedures set forth below. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"), AKW has a designated agent for receiving notices of copyright infringement and AKW follows the notice and take down procedures of the DMCA.

AKW encourages you to report any content on the Site that you believe infringes your rights.

If you have a good faith belief that content on the Site infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please follow the procedures set forth below. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"), AKW has a designated agent for receiving notices of copyright infringement and AKW follows the notice and take down procedures of the DMCA.

If you believe that any content on the Site contains content that violates your rights other than copyrights, please provide AKW at least the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (c) an explanation of what rights you own/have and why you believe the content infringes your rights sufficient for us to evaluate your complaint; and (d) accurate contact information for you.

We have a policy of terminating the accounts of users who (in our reasonable discretion) are repeat infringers. It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter. AKW will provide you with notice if your Contribution has been removed based on a third party complaint of alleged infringement of a third party's intellectual property rights.
