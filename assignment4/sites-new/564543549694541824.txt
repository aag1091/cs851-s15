Post navigationMonday February 9th is National Bagels & Lox Day!A bagel topped with cream cheese and lox (thinly sliced smoked salmon) is an iconic Jewish-American dish. Add sliced red onion and capers and you have a delicious sandwich thatâ€™s not just for breakfast! I like sliced tomato on mine! Try brie instead of cream cheese with black olives with a spritz of lemon!
