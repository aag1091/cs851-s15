Bitfountain is definitely a huge inspiration for us. If anyone has any questions about their story to 100k users, feel free to post comments here or on the blog.I set it up. It was semi successful. It’s tough on reddit because people are very skeptical. I think it had a degree of success because we discussed the lifestyle of iOS development instead of doing a hard pitch for our product.Right now our current strategy centers mostly on Email marketing. We also make use of Affiliates which help promote our courses to their users. We’re not too fancy right now. For example we haven’t explored paid ads though some of our affiliates do paid ads.
