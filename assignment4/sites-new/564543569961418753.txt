Ooc: So, after thinking the past like.. 5 minutes, I have decided that I'm going to be keeping this account as Stiles. Simply because with Stiles I can easily tie him into other verses of the Supernatural world when if i were to change to Dylan that would be more difficult. And I can post absolutely crazy shit on Stiles and no one would think twice to question it. Though, every now and then I do consider changing your Dylan I will remain Stiles for the time being. Don't really have many friends to get opinions from so this is my choice.Report ContentIf you believe this post is inappropriate, please report it.
