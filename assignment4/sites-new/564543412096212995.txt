Download Our Free Mobile Apps:The Most Amazing Thing About This Group Of Foxes Is Where They Live. This Place Is Seriously CoolAnimal sanctuaries are common in Japan, but this is one of the most exotic places I have ever seen. These amazing photos were taken in a sanctuary called Zao Fox Village, which is home to over 100 animals of six different fox varities.The reserve itself is quite vast, and is covered with trees and natural vegetation as it is located near the Miyagi Zao Mountains. While visiting, guests are allowed to greet the foxes up close as they roam free across the sanctuary, and are often encouraged to purchase food to feed the animals.In Japanese culture the fox is not only considered to be a trickster, but also a mystical deity of fertility, prosperity, and rice. They are also known as being the messengers of Inari ÅŒkami, who is the patron of swordsmiths and merchants. The reserve has several shrines located along its premises.
