We deliver everything from hi-quality video pre-roll and audio ads, to rich media banners that will not turn off your listeners and create additional, residual income for you and your station. It’s now part of the streamscape and is going to be the largest advertising growth area over the next several years, so you may as well get on board.We deliver advertising from our network of national and international advertisers and mobile content providers. All you have to do is check off a little box in your control panel and we take over the ad display ability, add you to our inventory, and desktop and mobile ads are automatically delivered to your listeners. We then take care of the rest, and you get a rev-share check every month from the aggregate split on all ads run across all your players and apps.You can also run your own ad campaigns for your local advertisers and sponsors, and fill the rest of the schedule automatically from our network. This gives you the best of both worlds...you can sell player time to local advertisers, and still not miss out on revenue from our Ad Delivery Network.Home PageThis is an example of the content section that opens within the player.
