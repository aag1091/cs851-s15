Let’s be clear to start. Floyd Mayweather & Nia Long have been friends for a while, so the fact he is dropping in her comments shouldn’t be too big of a deal. The wording of the comments is perhaps what caught everyone’s attention, including Nia’s response. Floyd has been dating Bad Medina & Nia has been with Spurs assistant coach Ime Udoka for years so the likelihood the comments have any means behind them are slim, but hey, you never really know.@IamJoeSports1 CommentOn 02.25.15 Obama,Putin,Bush, demonic,evil femeanists. Laci Green,etc. all are a bunch of satans because they love pollution,wars,cages called gaols,dehumanizing men who compliment ladies busts,bustlines and cleavages by caging them,threatening them to force them to said:When you legalize offensively hassling men who are being gentlemanly and respectful, you say I love Belial and his infernal brethren when you make fun of whistling, staring and compliments by calling it hassling so-called street or “sexual”. When you call the cops on customers who compliment your cleavage, ass or bust you in effect are saying, I love you Lucifer.
