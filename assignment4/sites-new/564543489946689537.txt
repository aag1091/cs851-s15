So here goes.1) Luis and Kian were born at 28wks (12wks early) 2) Luis and Kian fought for their lives and were 3 months old before they came home for the first time. 3) Luis and Kian were diagnosed with ataxic cerebral palsy aged two years old after an MRI scan. 4) although being behind they walked at 2 1/2yrs old 5) By 3 they were running and climbing (despite being wobbly) 6) They blended in mainstream school and you would never know they'd fought so hard. 7) Aged almost 7 they were diagnosed with Krabbe Disease, they can no longer run and climb like their friends ,Krabbe Leukodystrophy takes lives, it comes in four forms, infantile, late onset infantile, juvenile and late onset (adult) it doesn't care who you are, what colour you are if you are rich or poor. All too often it has control and it's too late. If England had new born screening .....then our story may have been different ........My twin son's age 7 were diagnosed with a genetic condition called Krabbe Disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosycermide lipidosis). It is a rare and often fatel degenerative disorder that effects the myelin sheath of the nervous system. My sons are currently waiting to have a stem cell transplant that we hope will delay progression but cannot cure. We have been advised to make memories to treasure and have a family holiday before their treatment starts, We hope to make many memories in the time we have Luis and Kian have a wish list you can follow them onCampaign Not Ready There's an issue with this Campaign Organizer's account.
