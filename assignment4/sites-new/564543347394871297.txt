I GUESS YOU COULD SAY this is part of my fuk it I'll put up what I want to put up yolo stageOkaySo likeI've cried to this song. No; I've SOBBED to this song. This song has broken me, many times. I first heard it in America last year and I was just shocked. Since then I've probably listened to it about 400 times, no word of a lie. I love everything about this song. I love the chords, I love the melody, I love the WORDS oh my goodness the words break me. I love how there's no real structure, so the song itself is like a story, or you could say, novel ;DAhh man. Every time I hear this song my heart hurts. I go on about it to everyone but genuinelyI LOVE THIS SONG. So. YouTube. Thank you. For allowing me to find this song and this person and to hear it and to SING it. Ahh man. I love you :DAlso apologies for the random lady who opens the door halfway through. We did so many takes and this was the best one. Although I did enjoy the one where Zoe interrupts us lolol.
