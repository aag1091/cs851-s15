Capricorn Personality TraitsIt is worth the time to take a closer look at the Capricorn personality traits. What they show the world is a person that is grounded in reality, they don’t seem to have much tolerance for “dreamers”.A Capricorn thinks long and hard about the ways to tackle a project, and examines all the possible outcomes before diving into the actual production (whether it is a gourmet meal or building a rocking chair). Any boss would be delighted to have a Capricorn (with their responsible and persevering personalities) be an intricate part of their team.“Caps” have an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and their persistence seems endless, as they will rarely leave a project unfinished. This should not be surprising, since they have done intense and accurate prep-work, down to the placement of each nail or sprig of parsley.A Capricorn works much more effectively when alone, as their large egos don’t leave much room for the help and/or opinions of others. Caps are fully aware of their talents and capabilities, and almost never trust someone else to finish a job, part of their controlling personality is that they enjoy starting and finishing a task all by themselves. By doing this, they don’t have to share the praise and the positive satisfaction of the finished product with anyone else.One important personality trait of a Capricorn that you must consider and respect is their punctuality, so it is advised to not keep a “Cap” waiting, if at all possible.On the inside, they may have a constant turmoil of mood swings (being depressed one moment, and then very happy the next). This inner conflict is usually kept under control, and is rarely exposed to strangers, but close family members and dear friends are provided a glimpse into the inner turmoil of the Capricorn mind.Although not unsociable, a Capricorn would much prefer to host a BBQ with a few close friends in a controlled and civilized setting, than to “bar-hop” or spend a haphazard, reckless evening that has no direction or purpose. A person born as a Capricorn requires social order, and this is reflected by their organizational skills and need to be “neat and tidy” in their home and office atmosphere.An individual born under the horoscope of Capricorn will fail at “open microphone” night at the local comedy club, but during an ordinary, non-staged atmosphere, they will say something at the appropriate time that will have everyone laughing out loud.Famous Capricorns include Elvis Presley, the “King of Rock n’ Roll”, and the very funny Betty White (who is still working hard at 91 years young). Cassius Clay, who you may know better as the boxing icon, Muhammad Ali is also a philanthropist and activist of peace.
