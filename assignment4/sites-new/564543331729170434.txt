My first foray into the 2 wheel RC scene. Really enjoyed running this for the first time and drew a crowd as a result. It's not difficult to drive, but it does require some finesse. I plan on working on my riding skills and then getting some hop ups too. Hope you enjoyed and as always, please like, share, comment and subscribe!
