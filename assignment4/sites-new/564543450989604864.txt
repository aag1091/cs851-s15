For each category there is:1st place – 2nd place – 3rd placeAll the eLiquids that were nominated for this Special Award were reviewed by the Spinfuel eLiquid Review Team in 2013/2014 time period. (Next year the awards will be chosen from 2015 reviews only).The Spinfuel eLiquid Review Team has reviewed easily more than a hundred eliquids this year. When it came time to choose the best of the best we looked through all our previous reviews, spent dozens of hours revisiting the award winners, and one by one we whittled down our list until we came up with the eight selections you see here.Choosing from all the excellent eLiquids we had this year and last was no easy task. An award winning eliquid must possess many qualities, among them are flavor fidelity, authenticity, vapor production, quality of ingredients, consistency, and safety. No one quality makes an award winner, the ejuice must possess them all. Of course, with hundreds of brands on the market we haven’t (yet) reviewed them all, but from the brands we have reviewed, the winners and runners up are truly deserving of the Spinfuel Choice Award For eLiquid Excellence.BLACKSTONEVape DudesVaporFiKind JuiceMigCigs – MigQuidHurricane VaporThe Vapor GirlVirgin VaporLucky RuckusGingers eJuiceGothic VaporGuilty Pleasures OrganicsAZVapeXpoIMPORTANT MESSAGE TO OUR READERSThank you for visiting Spinfuel eMagazine.
