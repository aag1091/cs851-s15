Escape the crowds of Austin, Texas and head to San Antonio for incredible art exhibits, delicious Tex-Mex and an American history lesson. After checking out The Alamo, take time to tour La Villita, an historic arts village, then make your way down to the tree-lined paths of the River Walk -- located close to the "heart of the city."
