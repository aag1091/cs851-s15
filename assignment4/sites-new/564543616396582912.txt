At the beginning of the interview, Evans asked Paul about his comment that vaccines should be "voluntary.""Did you really just say to Laura Ingraham that you think most vaccines in this country should be 'voluntary?'" Evans asked Paul.“What Rand Paul said about vaccines was controversial, but by starting with, ‘Did you really just say…’ Evans seemed to have a chip on her shoulder," Kurtz said about Evans on "Mediabuzz."Later in the CNBC interview, Evans asked Paul about a bill the senator sponsored that would allow companies to bring overseas cash to the U.S. at a holiday corporate tax rate, citing research on corporate taxes. Her line of questioning then prompted the senator to shush her and tell her to "calm down.""Shushing a host, especially a woman, did not exactly look gentlemanly, but Evans sounded condescending when she said, 'I'm sure you know…' as if there were no other possible evidence or contrary view," Kurtz said."The substance of the questions was legitimate, but Kelly Evans really aggravated the senator with her tone," Kurtz added.
