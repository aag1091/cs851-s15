My BlogI went into surgery November 19th, 2013 at Virgina Baptist Hospital, for a total hysterecetemy . I woke up while in surgery. I threw a right hook, that NOBODY seen. My Surgeon, told me she didn't see it. I put my right arm under a curtain they had up, thinking it was a blanket. That's when people started to realize that I was awake. They were all behind my surgeon talking, and laughing, having a great time. They started yelling at me. I heard, STOP, DON'T, WAIT, and then I heard people running at me. They grabbed my right arm and pulled it out from under the curtain. My head was laid to the left. I heard my surgeon slam the tool she was working with down so hard, everything on that tray was banging on that tray. At the time I was thinking that something had happened to my arm in surgery. So since they were holding my right arm down, I used my left arm to push myself up. I was able to get my head turned to the center, before I was ever hit with a 2nd REALLY BIG dose of something. Finally my body dropped back to the table, and my head rolled to the left. I couldn't move at that point, I couldn't talk because there was a tube down my throat. I couldn't open my eyes because according to my surgeon my eyes were taped shut. I had to lay there and listen to them all talking on my right side, with no way of letting them know I was still awake. I remember making a mental note, that IF I made it out of that alive, I needed to remember, to tell my sister, and daughter. I wasn't sure I would live through that!
