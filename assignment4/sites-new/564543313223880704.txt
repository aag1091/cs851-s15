Take me to church. Is this like a pre-emptive subtweet of the Academy Awards?Jon CaramanicaThere must have been actual Grammy magic floating around tonight because the show managed to make John Legend better than Beyoncé, for at least a few minutes. I felt like she was a little lost inside her song, “Take My Hand, Precious Lord.”Dave ItzkoffI take your point, but I thought the Beyoncé performance was pretty stellar. How strange that the show closed with an artist (Beyoncé) and a movie (“Selma”) that were overshadowed or otherwise ignored.Jon CaramanicaMaybe because after a night full of soporific performances, this was the only one with a palpable pulse? The Grammys was like a UCB folk-music sketch this year.Dave ItzkoffYes, those were their aces up their sleeves. Someone knew Beck would win.Jon CaramanicaIs it even worth being dispirited by that? I’m far more vexed by Beck’s win than any of Sam Smith’s, for what it’s worth.Dave ItzkoffMaybe I’m just restating your question, but can I say that I genuinely enjoyed this show, while being disappointed by so many of the wins?Jon CaramanicaYou can say that. I don’t know if you’d be right, but you can say that. The speed of this show was so slow, the energy so low, that it’s hard to feel warmly even about the high points.Those were wondrous! I submit! But so much space between them. I like that the Grammys were willing to let Kanye do two new songs and that he repaid them by letting them know just how little he respected their statuettes.Dave ItzkoffHe was my big winner tonight, even over Sam Smith. And he patched things up with Taylor Swift!PhotoPop truce: Kanye West and Taylor Swift at the Grammy Awards.Credit Larry Busacca/Getty Images for NarasJon CaramanicaI like to think that photo is really of the two of us, live-bloggers brought together by destiny.Dave ItzkoffNo matter what Kanye said, smiling makes me smile.Jon CaramanicaEnjoy your vacation, Dave – will miss you at the Oscars!Dave ItzkoffThanks man. Will try to check ’em out when I’m not changing diapers.Common and John Legend closed the show with “Glory.”Lucy Nicholson/Reuters
