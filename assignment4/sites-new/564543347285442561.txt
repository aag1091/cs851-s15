NavigationMoney Troubles - Celebs Who Went Broke!#1 Rapper Beanie Sigel's Tax DebtRapper Beanie Sigel is serving two years in federal prison. Why? For none other than failing to pay his tax bill. Sigel owed a lofty total, more than $728,000 to be exact. Earning more than $3 million between 1999 and 2005, he only paid $10,000 in taxes. It could have been worse however as the rapper faced up to three years in prison. Sigel became well known after becoming a part of Jay-Z's famed Roc-A-Fella crew and put out four solo albums. This isn't his first time in prison. He served a year and a day in 2004 for weapons charges.
