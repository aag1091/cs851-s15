Miley Cyrus is no wholesome idol, but Bangerz is one great pop show10/18/2014The Sydney leg of Cyrus's 2014 tour was a fabulous dance on the grave of everything pre-Bangerz. It was crude (Cyrus's stage banter might have been written by Tarantino) and it was outlandishly lewd (her succession of leotards rode uncomfortably high, and there were ludicrously oversized prop breasts and buttocks aplenty throughout the evening). Most of all, though, it was spectacular.Miley Cyrus is the unapologetic pop star who can trace her lineage from Madonna to Lady Gaga but with a dose of smarts and obvious affection for her clearly besotted and worshipful fans.Cyrus knows her audience and while some naive parents, who havenâ€™t bothered to research the tour may be shocked, she is simply being your average twenty-something albeit on a much grander scale.
