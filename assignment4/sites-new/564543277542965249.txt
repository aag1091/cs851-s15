"Burn"The FlenserArtists:King Woman is the doomy alter-ego of San Francisco-based musician Kristina Esfandiari. Best known for her former vocal duties with Bay Area shoegazers Whirr, she soon became Miserable, showcasing folk and noise influences along with her engrossing alto on last year's quietly-released Halloween DreamEP. Disparate as they may seem, each of Esfandiari's preferred genres (folk, metal, shoegaze) contribute to a broader pallette that places equally strong emphases on beauty and destructionâ€”an aesthetic not dissimilar to that of another Californian contemporary, Chelsea Wolfe.King Woman's ensuing sound resembles an aural pyre indeed on "Burn", from the forthcoming long-player Doubt. The soured guitar riffs circling overhead feed the creeping, leaden thud of Esfandiari's bandmates, which in turn informs the drone-like cadence of the vocalist's coos. This order of operations provides the basis for a negative feedback loop that's as dreamlike as it is suffocating; we can only listen as King Woman's flames inch their way up and out, as if powered by a fervent death wish. And isn't that how doom's best done?
