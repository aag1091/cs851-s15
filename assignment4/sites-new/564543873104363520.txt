The Way to Happiness: A Nonreligious Moral CodeThe Way to Happiness: A nonreligious moral code providing a common sense guide to better living, compassion and happiness for all.The Way to Happiness appeals to the inherent decency in every human being.Moral guidance has been the domain of religion since the dawn of time. Yet throughout history—and never more so than in this twenty-first-century materialistic world—that role has been severely undermined. War upon war, prompted by religious conflict, continues to this day. What, then, is a solution?Instead of finding differences between ourselves—race, color and, most notably, religion—what if all could find common bonds of agreement? What if there were moral precepts that did not require that people subscribe to the beliefs of one religion or another, but which merely began from the starting point that we simply respect the beliefs of others?Such is The Way to Happiness, a nonreligious moral code based wholly on common sense and which can serve as a guide to better living…to happiness.Accordingly, The Way to Happiness is a moral code that can simultaneously be embraced by members of every religious faith – Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu and Scientologist.FAQBackground and Basic PrinciplesScientology BeliefsScientology FounderWhat Scientology Does for the IndividualScientology and Dianetics BooksScientology and Dianetics Training ServicesScientology and Dianetics AuditingScientology MinistersInside a Church of ScientologyScientology Attitudes and PracticesThe Organization of ScientologyScientology in Society
