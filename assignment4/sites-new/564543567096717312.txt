Based originally on the KBS1 game show, “The Golden Bell Challenge,” “Star Golden Bell” is a variety show in which stars compete against one another in quiz-style games to win prizes. The planned Lunar New Year special will be the first time the show will be aired since it was cancelled in 2010. Kim Gu Ra, Sung Si Kyung, and Lee Ji Yeon are slated to host.
