New Concept Art for Rise of the Tomb Raider DebutsFollowing the cover reveal earlier this week, Game Informer is back with some new concept art for the upcoming Rise of the Tomb Raider. Check it out in the gallery viewer below!“I’ve often said that the environment is the second most important character in the game. It is the adversary that Lara ultimately has to overcome,” game director Brian Horton told the outlet. “The weather and the danger of the traversal all have to come through in those concept pieces. A good concept for Tomb Raider tends to have those things: interesting composition, mood and atmosphere, and a sense of mystery and intrigue. There’s something over there I have to get there. How do I do that?”Rise of the Tomb Raider continues the story of Lara Croft as she seeks to learn more about the deeper, secret world she has discovered around her. Obsessed by what she has seen, Lara is now threatened by a shadow organization intent on killing her for what she knows. She is pushed to her physical and mental limits as she seeks the truth buried deep within the tombs of an ancient world. To unravel the mystery of a Lost City, Lara must use her survival skills and wits, learn to trust new friends, and ultimately accept her destiny as the Tomb Raider.Rise of the Tomb Raider will be released as a timed-exclusive for the Xbox One and Xbox 360 later this year.
