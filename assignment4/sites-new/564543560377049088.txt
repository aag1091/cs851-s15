As you arrived with your partner at the cabin, a feeling of dismay erupts from the pit of your stomach. As you step onto the porch, your partner following close behind you, a faint coppery stench fills your nose.You reluctantly turn the knob and slowly push the door open only to be greeted by a sea of blood. It was everywhere; crimson dripping from the ceiling, trickling down the walls, and seeping into the cracks of the floor boards. Entrails were scattered everywhere. It was truly horrific.You turn to look at your partner with utter terror and say in a low whisper, “This is a slaughter-house,”. He doesn’t reply. How could he? The sight before the two of you was horrendous.He watches you walk ahead into the moon shone cabin and smirks. ‘Perfect,’ he thought to himself as he clutched the crimson knife in his bloodied hands.
