My Fundraising PageOn May 3, 2015, I will be running in the Flying Pig Marathon in order to raise money for the Leukemia & Lymphma Society. Although it will be a challenge for me to complete this race, I will be especially motivated by the excitement of knowing that it will benefit such a worthy cause.I am asking friends and family to consider sponsoring me for this event. I have two ambitious goals – first to complete the run without sustaining any bodily harm and second to meet my personal goal of raising $2500 for the Leukemia & Lymphma Society. I would greatly appreciate your kind consideration by making a donation toward this goal. All donations are, of course, tax deductible.Your donation will help fund treatments that save lives every day; like immnuotherapies that use a person’s own immune system to kill cancer. You may not know it, but every single donation helps save a life with breakthrough therapies such as these.Patients need these cures and they need your support.One day we will have this beat, but until then please join me in supporting this very important cause.Supporter Comments"Good Luck, be healthy, have fun and GOOOO TEAM!
