He served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013.He told Panorama: "As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present."HSBC's Swiss accounts in numbers106,000clients with Swiss bank accounts203countries involved$118bn total assets held in Swiss accounts11,235 clients from Switzerland held $31.2bn9,187 clients from France held $12.5bn7,000 clients from UK held $21.7bnSource: ICIJ/PanoramaReutersTreasury minister David Gauke defended Lord Green's appointment on BBC's Radio 4. "I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that Lord Green was involved in this sort of activity", but said he did not know whether anyone asked him about HSBC prior to his government appointment.But Ms Hodge said: "Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices."Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer."Verbal messagesMeanwhile, HSBC said it has completely overhauled its private banking business and has reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70% since 2007.In a statement, the bank said: "HSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money."The bank said it now puts compliance and tax transparency ahead of profitability.But Panorama has spoken to a whistleblower who said there were still problems with tax dodging at HSBC private bank when she worked there in 2013.Sue Shelley was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg. She said HSBC did not keep its promise to change. "I think the verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice and that disturbed me greatly," she said.It was her job to make sure HSBC followed the rules, but she said she was sacked after raising concerns. She has since won a tribunal hearing for unfair dismissal.Watch Panorama: The Bank of Tax Cheats on February 9 at 20.30 GMT on BBC1.
