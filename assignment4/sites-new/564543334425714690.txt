I’m excited to bring to YOU another great giveaway! One of the things I love about blogging is being able to join other wonderful bloggers to give back to my readers. I so appreciate each and everyone of you, because without YOU… there would be no Blog by Donna. Well, as far as anyone else was concerned anyway.My husband and I will be celebrating 10 years of marriage on May 21, 2015 and I would love to win this gift card to put towards buying us a new bed. Our bed is totally falling apart and we just haven’t had the money to buy a new one. It would be a great present for us.
