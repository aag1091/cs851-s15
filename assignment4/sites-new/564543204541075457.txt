Fontina Polenta With Roasted Spring VegetablesCaper Crusted Redfish Over Spring Vegetables In Butter FondueThe StorySweet and sticky tsukune meatballs are typically prepared on hot Japanese grills, but our twist on this recipe involves baking and broiling the chicken until it’s perfectly tender with a crispy crust. With each bite you’ll find traditional Asian flavors like ginger, mirin and soy sauce. Grab some chopsticks and enjoy them with vermicelli noodles tossed in a sesame-lime-dressing!What We Sendground chickeninch gingergarlicscallions, dividedlimevermicelli noodlessesame oilmirin winedark brown sugardry sherrysoy saucepanko bread crumbsWhat You'll needwatereggkosher saltblack pepperWhat To Uselarge potaluminum foilbaking sheetCalories600TypeDairy Free Gluten Soy ChickenDifficultyMediumPrep Time30-40 minutesChef SuzanneOur ManifestoRealWe believe food should be really fresh and really real.
