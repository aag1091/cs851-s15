Did you know that by the end of this decade Millennials will account for half of all corporate travel? 2020 isn’t that far away when it comes to forecasting and strategizing. How can you prepare to accommodate these younger travelers?24/7 Access. Whether you are a hotel chain, an airline, car rental company or a Travel Management Company (TMC), Millennials are known for expecting around-the-clock availability. If you don’t cater to this need, don’t expect this generation to find much value in your services.Useful Technology. On par with their self-sufficient attitude, Millennials are more likely to use various emerging travel apps and websites. Online booking tools available through your TMC are key for these travelers as they are 1.7 times more likely to use a mobile travel app than their 35 and up traveler counterparts.Monitor your Reviews. With review sites like Yelp, Google Places and the like, customer service has never been so transparent. Millennials not only take reviews into serious consideration before planning a trip, they are also more like to post a review after their trip is complete. It goes without saying that a customer service-focused strategy is necessary to keep Millennials coming back.Avoid Carbon Copies. Professionals in their 20s and 30s are demonstrating their lackluster for big chains and hotel brands are taking notice. Big brands like Hyatt, Starwood and Radisson are targeting Millennials with new chains that offer a unique, boutique experience different at each location. What you can expect are neighborhood-focused, urban, unique and tech-friendly chains.If you’re planning on attracting a majority of business travelers in the future, your business is going to have to rethink their priorities. Gone are the days when Wi-Fi is considered an add-on and online booking is a luxury – these are now expected.What is your business prepared to do to compete for Millennial business?
