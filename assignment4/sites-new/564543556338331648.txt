"I felt that he's the one. And after his arrest, I found myself doing things that I never expected that I`m able to do."Emara sent a letter at that time to Clooney requesting that Fahmy be released and sent to Canada.For many months, Fahmy's family has tried to call attention to serious health problems the journalist is enduring in prison.

"We had confirmations from highest sources that he would be deported in the coming days ... and all we got is false hope."He said that his brother formally renounced his Egyptian citizenship because officials told him that if he did, he would be released."We don't understand why he has to stand in court when he has (renounced) his passport," Adel Fahmy said." That was the deal ... that he'd denounce his citizenship, that they (the Egyptian government) would not announce it to the media, but they did the exact opposite. They did announce it to the media and he is devastated that this is happening to him."Mohamed Fahmy has a "permanent disability in his arm," his brother said, adding that because the journalist had been wrongly imprisoned, his "reputation has been severely tainted."Greste's releaseAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Greste's freedom was won "unconditionally."The journalists were accused of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood, though each has maintained steadfastly that they did nothing wrong.One of Greste's lawyers suggested days ago there could be more legal issues ahead for him."According to Egyptian law, this is considered an extradition," Amr Eldib said. "Peter must be tried in Australia and authorities there must determine if he is guilty or not."
