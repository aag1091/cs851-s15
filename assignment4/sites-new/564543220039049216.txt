The alleged December incident sparked protests, and authorities responded by pulling the car service off the road. About six weeks later, Uber resumed operations in New Delhi as a not-for-profit service and applied to be licensed like a traditional taxi service.In a blog post outlining its safety efforts, the company explained that customers won't see a big red button mounted in the vehicle -- "There is no way to ensure that they are kept in working condition across all the cars in the city," for one. Instead, users will find "an easily accessible in-app panic button that one can activate with a single tap."Uber also says it is creating "a dedicated local Incident Response Team" and will expand its tracking feature to "allow users to easily share their trip details and real-time location with up to 5 friends and family members."
