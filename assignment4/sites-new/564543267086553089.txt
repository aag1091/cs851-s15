FeaturesI’ll show you mine, if you show me yoursThe men who risk everything to sextI have never sent a “sext”. I have, it’s true, done a bit of internet dating, but the photos I have posted have tended to be of my face. I have never fought the temptation to whip out a smartphone, stick it down my knickers and snap. I have also never thought that what I needed to cheer me up on a winter’s night was the sudden appearance on my phone of a stranger’s penis. But I’m beginning to think that the fact I haven’t done these things marks me out as a member of a prehistoric species. I am beginning to feel, in fact, like the Pope on Twitter.The Pope might well prefer the traditional meaning of the word “sext”, which the OED defines as “a service forming part of the Divine Office of the Western Christian Church, traditionally said (or chanted) at the sixth hour of the day”.
