The above – rather helpfully – describes both a panda coast and the music of Panda Coast, here presenting us with four charming tracks that are here to give you a great big, comforting ear-hug.If I were to jump from a twenty story building, I would want to land safely on the soft, squishy musical pillow that is Leisure, by Panda Coast.Pastels is a swirling, whirling mass of feather-soft arpeggios. Bokeh is a pulsating hug for the head that actually cured my headache today. Stay For Comfort does what it says on the tin – it stays, and comforts. For Me is gentle kisses of sculpted sound, falling peacefully like summer rain.Leisure is short, but sweet and memorable.BEST TRACK:Pastels is glorious and showcases Panda Coast’s musical palette the best out of the four tracks.
