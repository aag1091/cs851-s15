Instead of one app store what you have are literally hundreds of different app stores vying for consumers attentions.As a developer you do not need to upload your app to every single app store, instead targeting the top ten or so stores will get you access to most Chinese Android handsets. If you are not fluent in Chinese getting into a Chinese App Store can be a little difficult. Over the next few weeks I want to look at how to sign-up for developer accounts at a few of the major Chinese app stores and how to release your apps into those app stores.For now here is a list of the top ten app stores in China (well eleven) and links to their developer pages.
