"I am really blessed. I just felt like it was a good time to get it."You'd think this would be the worst time considering the Buckeyes just won a national title with their third-string quarterback and just signed two more - four-star prospect Torrance Gibson and three-star prospect Joey Burrow - in the 2015 recruiting class. Ohio State is going to have six scholarship quarterbacks on its roster next season.Clark will be a junior at Massillon next year and won't even sign with the Buckeyes until February of 2017. But he has no doubts about his future at Ohio State.He's so certain that he is fine permanently tattooing his body with it."If I don't go to Ohio State, it's going to be my fault," Clark said. "There's nothing that would make me not want to go there. For me, it's kind of an extra motivation to think that one day I am going to be down there playing with them.Follow Uscleveland.com is powered by Plain Dealer Publishing Co. and Northeast Ohio Media Group.
