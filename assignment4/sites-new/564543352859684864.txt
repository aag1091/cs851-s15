Cops Charged After Surveillance Shows Them Run Man’s Scooter Off Road And Beat Him18430010Video surveillance emerged this week in court showing two Philadelphia police officers chasing down a man on a scooter, running him off the road and beating him with batons.23-year-old Najee Rivera was charged with aggravated assault on May 29, 2013 after he received orbital bone fractures and lacerations to his head from arresting Philadelphia officers Sean McKnight and Kevin Robinson.Rivera testified in court that after the officers pulled him over, they stepped out of their car with batons extended and became aggressive. Rivera says he got frightened and fled on his scooter.The resulting pursuit was captured on surveillance video by a local business.The footage contradicts the original police report officers made which claimed Rivera became violent, grabbed officer Robinson, and “slammed him against a brick wall.”Instead, the footage clearly shows officers forcing Rivera’s scooter off the road with their patrol car, causing him to wreck – Before piling out, taking him to the ground, and raining down baton strikes and punches upon his head, face, and upper torso.The initial police report also accused Rivera of “throwing elbows during the struggle.” The footage doesn’t support this claim either.Watch the raw footage:A grand jury found earlier this week that Rivera was wailing loudly but showed “no aggressive actions” as he was lying on the ground and being struck repeatedly by officers.As a consequence, officers McKnight and Robinson were charged with “aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and filing false reports.” They have been suspended for 30 days with intent to be dismissed from the department.“The video undermined every aspect of the officer’s account,” said Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. “I will prosecute these two officers to the fullest extent of the law. Simply put, no one — not even police officers — is above the law.”Rivera was cleared of all charges and has been awarded a $200,000 settlement for pain and suffering.
