After Wales had brought Ireland's 10-Test winning streak to an end in a brutal meeting in Cardiff, an enterprising England team finally got the job done against Scotland at Twickenham. France's win over Italy in Rome was far less entertaining, but it leaves four teams with at...With two rounds of the Six Nations still to go, and another two months before Warren Gatland finalises his Lions squad, hope springs eternal for British and Irish players intent on spending their early summer in Australia.

The tour started at Clapham Junction, and was diesel hauled to Bristol, where 70013 Oliver Cromwell, would take the train to Shrewsbury via Ludlow. Locations for the day were all within a few miles of each other. We first see Ollie accelerating past Ludlow Racecourse, after just dropping passengers off at there destination.

Although not geographically set in South Wales other than being a horizon away over the Bristol Channel, The WSR is set in similar scenery to South Wales with the Quantock Hills giving a near scenic resemblance of the Welsh Valleys or the Brecon Beacons. The railway provided a feast of steam fleet that would've ran all over South Wales in the days of steam. Locomotives featured in this film: BR Standard Class 7MT 70000 Britannia masquerading as '70021 Morning Star' (a former Cardiff Canton 86C based Brit) GWR 5600 Class No.5643 GWR Hall Class No.4936 Kinlet Hall GWR Modified Hall Class No.6960 Raveningham Hall GWR 2884 Class No.3850 BR (LMS) Ivatt Class 2 No.46521 GWR 4575 Class No.5542 GWR 4200 Class No.4270 Filmed during Thursday & Friday 26th & 27th MarchFor their 2015 spring steam gala, the West Somerset Railway decided on a South Wales theme. Running between the 26th and the 29th of March, and titled 'Steam in South Wales', the gala brought together several locomotive classes which would have operated in that region during the days of steam. A couple of notable features from the gala included 70000 'Britannia' being renamed and renumbered to scrapped classmate 70021 'Morning Star', a former resident of Cardiff Canton; and 6960 & 4936 double heading on a 12 coach train on the evening of the Friday. The full line up of locos included: Guest: - GWR 5600 Class 0-6-2T no.5643 (A last minute replacement for 6695. Who suffered damage after the low loader transporting her to the WSR collapsed.
