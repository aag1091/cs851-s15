State Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, said Friday he plans to introduce a bill to cut down on exemptions to school vaccine requirements.AUSTIN — Even with a measles outbreak dominating headlines, don’t expect an avalanche of immediate support for a high-profile idea to cut down on the ability of Texas parents to opt their children out of school immunization requirements.Two state Senate committee chairmen told the Houston Chronicle they have hesitations about a bill that state Rep. Jason Villalba said Friday he plans to introduce to eliminate religious and philosophical exemptions to the requirements.State Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, who leads the Health and Human Services Committee, said through a spokesman that while he views vaccines as a “critical component of protecting the public health…(he) would prefer to increase education about the safety of these vaccines rather than imposing new mandates that would ask Texas parents to act against their own conscience or their deeply-held religious beliefs.”The chairman of the Senate education committee, Republican Larry Taylor of Friendswood, offered a more moderate response but noted that in Texas, “there is also a long standing tradition of giving parents the right to make decisions regarding their children’s healthcare.”“I stand ready to hear parents’ and legislators’ opinions on this very serious issue,” Taylor said.In the 2013-2014 school year, more than 38,000 students making up roughly 0.75 percent of the state’s school-age population used the exemptions, according to a Houston Chronicle analysis of data from the Department of State Health Services. That was far higher than a decade earlier, when exemptions were granted to just 3,000 students making up about 0.1 percent of the population, according to the Chronicle.The power to cite religious views to object is on the books in 48 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while the objection on personal beliefs exists in 20 states.But a measles outbreak started by an unvaccinated women at Disneyland has made several states re-consider the exemptions. A bill to eliminate them has already been introduced in California.Villalba, a Dallas Republican, said he believes in personal choice but cannot stand by and watch as diseases that have been eradicated for decades get spread in part due to parents who opt children out of vaccinates based on irrational fears that immunizations cause autism. The issue should be important to all Texans, he said, because even those who have been vaccinated can get a disease if it grows strong enough by spreading.He cited recent outbreaks of measles and whooping cough in North Texas that sickened a couple dozen people and were tied to people who may not have been vaccinated.“If you’re going to send your children to the public schools, then the public school children that are already there deserve the protection of having those vaccines,” he said.Villalba said there is “tremendous, bipartisan support” for the measure across the state.Views appeared more split in the Legislature.One powerful conservative lawmaker did weigh in to support the proposal, however.“The agricultural community understands the value of ‘herd health.’ You have to vaccinate the individual for the protection of the entire body,” said state Rep. Myra Crownover, R-Denton, who chairs the House Public Health Committee. “While I respect personal freedom and individual choice, I think there is a responsibility to the community to be vaccinated.”
