'We cannot be relaxed. This is a massive three points for us. The game was very tough but at the end of the day I think we deserved three points,' he said.'We knew they hadn't scored for a long time, which made some extra pressure for them, but for us also. We knew they had to react and it was a very difficult game. In the end it was a massive three points.'We don't have time to relax even one second. There are 14 games to go and we must stay focused. Seven points is big but this can change quickly.'Play score predictorHERE TO HELPChelsea Football Club, Stamford Bridge, Fulham Road, London, SW6 1HSGeneral enquiries, including enquiries to the Club Liaison Officer.
