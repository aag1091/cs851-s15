Have you heard of Swoon Reads? Well if you have then you know that they have a ton of free indie books just waiting for you to read, and if you don’t know.. well then pay attention. Swoon Reads is a place for swoon-worthy young adult literature, and also a place for indie writers to put there work out there and get feedback, fans, and possibly even a publishing deal. It’s actually really great…
