The former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has predicted that Greece will be forced to exit the euro, as its new prime minister outlined plans to keep the debt-stricken country financially afloat.His stark comments came just hours before Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras told parliament he would on Wednesday ask fellow eurozone members in Brussels for an emergency short-term bridging loan, to allow Athens more time to negotiate a new debt deal.“The bail-out failed,” he said. “The new government is not justified in asking for an extension… because it cannot ask for an extension of mistakes.”Mr Tsipras’s Left-wing Syriza party swept to power last month on a pledge to renegotiate the terms of Greece’s €240bn bail-out deal with the EU and International Monetary Fund five years ago.However, the new prime minister has a fight on his hands, with EU officials so far rejecting his efforts to renegotiate terms. On Friday, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said Athens must either apply for an extension of its current bailout by February 16, to continue receiving financial assistance, or go it alone.In a BBC interview, Mr Greenspan, who headed the US central bank for nearly 20 years, said “I believe [Greece] will eventually leave. The problem is that there is no way that I can conceive of the euro continuing, unless and until all of the members of eurozone become politically integrated – actually even just fiscally integrated won’t do it.”
