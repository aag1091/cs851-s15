@FamkeB I'm not sold on it either, but I'll wait for the MV before making any final judgements :) I like Hyuk's photo as well, even though they're all good. N's surprises me though cause for some strange reason it doesn't look quite like him... I don't know maybe I'm just crazy lolI am so glad I discovered Vixx recently! Most of their songs are genuinely great. I haven't chosen a bias yet, but I'm leaning toward Hyuk. I do enjoy their darker concepts but I also like their cute concepts because I surprisingly don't feel like vomiting when I watch them.
