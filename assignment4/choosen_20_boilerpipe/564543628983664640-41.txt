<p> No matter what I do, I always have dark circles and bags under my eyes. I layer on the concealer and it doesn't help. It's not attractive and I've been dealing with this issue for some time now. I've used different products to try to aide the problem, but haven't had amazing results. I'm in need of some quick eye rejuvenation!
<p> EyeDews is a refreshing, under-eye rejuvenation treatment. EyeDews are specifically formulated to help you look and feel great!
<p> Gentle and natural, this all-in-one single-step regimen effectively corrects all that plagues your delicate under-eye skin. EyeDews are nutrient rich jelly pads of natural marine collagen infused with hyaluronic ccid, chitosan and Vitamins C &amp; E to combat free radical imbalance, sun damage, discoloration, dry skin and wrinkles in the troubled skin under your eyes. This single use under eye treatment will soothe and smooth your beauty woes, and relax and return you to a more energized, youthful state. These would be great for using before an important meeting, first date, work conference, if you didn't get much sleep the night before, and any other time your eyes need a little pick-me-up.
<p> When I heard about these, I knew I needed to try them. I love anything that deals with relaxation and EyeDews sounded wonderful.
<p> I was sent two packs of EyeDews, under-eye gel packs. The directions said to apply them underneath your eyes and let them sit for 20 minutes. It is also recommended that you refrigerate them for maximum results, but it is not required. I did put mine in the fridge though. Once you take the EyeDews out of the package, they are a little slippery so it might take you a minute to fully place them underneath your eye. I noticed that the pads are cool and refreshing on my face instantly. I enjoyed the refreshing cold of the pads on my eyes though. The pads don't feel heavy on your face and I barely noticed they were on.
<p> I laid down for 20 minutes on the couch and turned on soothing music. I closed my eyes and tried to relax while I let EyeDews do all of the work. Once my timer went off, I went to the bathroom to check out the results. I instantly noticed the bags and puffiness under my eyes had been reduced. My under-eyes felt smooth and hydrated. I looked more awake and alert, which is amazing! I was very pleased with the results and I will definitely be using EyeDews again in the future.
<p> EyeDews would be perfect for incorporating them into your at-home spa routine. Why not throw them into a gift basket for a friend's birthday? She will love them! EyeDews are essential for men or women, at any time. If you have a face, you will benefit from EyeDews.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win 2 packs of EyeDews (which contain 3 sets of pads in each box.)
<p> Winner will be chosen on April 30, 2012 at 10 pm and then will be emailed. One entry per day.Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours. Thank you and good luck!

<p> Have you ever been on the hunt for a certain scented candle? Sure you can easily find an apple pie or clean linen scented candle, but you can't seem to find that one candle that has the personalized scent that you're looking for. Don't settle for a candle that isn't what you want. Lumnique Candles has created an ultimate candle paradise, just for you!
<p> Lumnique Candles specializes in personalized scented candles. Each 8 oz. candle is made-to-order using a soy wax blend, clean burning dual cotton wicks, eco-friendly color dyes, and essential fragrance oils that retain their scent while the candle burns. Mother's Day is quickly approaching. What better gift than to give mom a beautiful glass candle that is her favorite color and scent. She will absolutely love it. Luminque Candles also make excellent hostess, housewarming, birthday and any other occasion presents. The recipient will appreciate the effort that you put into designing the candle especially for them!
<p> When I was allowed to choose a candle of my choice, I took my time browsing the different colors and fragrances. There were so many choices that it was actually hard to choose just one! I finally settled on creating a candle for a harmonious home. I chose fire as my color, and selected magnolia as my candle fragrance. Fire is representative of excitement, energy, health, vitality, and more. Magnolia is a sweet and light floral scent. The harmonious home is meant to bring tranquality to a dwelling and create a peaceful haven. It was a lot of fun to be able to build my candle exactly as I wanted. What a unique and fun concept.
<p> The candle came in the mail rather quickly and was beautifully presented. The black box is elegant, yet modern at the same time.
<p> When I opened the box, I was greeted with the beautiful candle, a set of matches, and a note detailing my candle. I loved knowing what each category of my candle meant.
<p> The candle is quality made and the glass is very sturdy and durable. The fire color is a bold and rich red which reminds me of spring. I chose Magnolia because the light floral scent reminded me of spring too, even though I had never smelled it before. It has a subtle floral scent that I can only describe as "clean." It's not overwhelming or too powerful.
<p> I set the candle on my coffee table and lit it with the provided matches. I'm not sure if it was just the match that I used, but the flame very quickly burned down the candle and came dangerously close to my fingers. That worried me so I had to blow it out and use a wand lighter instead. That might have just been a defective match, I didn't try to use another match.
<p> I love the double wick of the candle, it's a fun twist on a regular candle. The candle smells delicious when burning and in no time the light floral aroma hugged my living room. I really like that Lumnique made a candle with eco-friendly materials. I'd like to think that the candle brings tranquility and a peaceful environment into my home. If you're looking to de-stress, lighting a Lumnique candle and sitting back and relaxing would do just the trick.
<p> If you haven't yet brought a Lumnique candle into your home, now is the perfect time to do so.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a custom-built candle from Lumnique Candles.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> If you regularly entertain and have company over, it's important to have nice, quality dishes to serve your guests with. Having a beautiful place setting is just as important as the food you serve. Warm conversation and delicious food definitely makes the occasion extra special too.
<p> Lenox is America's leading tabletop and giftware brand. They offer fine china, casual dinnerware, crystal, flatware, giftware, home decor and tabletop products. Lenox's main mission is making your tabletop beautiful with quality dish and flatware. There are so many styles and patterns that you'll quickly fall in love with.
<p> If you're a fan of Downton Abbey, listen up! Lenox has some fantastic tips for adding Downton Abbey style (from genuine old patterns of the era that are still mega-popular today!) to their entertaining. Everyone's having Downton withdrawal, and this is a great way to spend the hiatus, preparing for a big Downton dinner for the premiere of Season 3.
<p> You might want to pare down the Edwardian tradition of serving eight to nine courses, and you may not measure the distance between forks as the long-suffering butlers do at Downton, but you can still set a magnificent table. For your “upstairs” fine china, you need to look no further than America’s iconic name in tabletop, Lenox. Many patterns from America’s leading dinnerware brand would be right at home in Downton, but perhaps none so much as Autumn, which was actually designed in the period.
<p> Originally introduced in 1918, Autumn could well have been gifted by their American relations to Matthew and Mary Crawley, who in the Downton saga (finally!) became engaged on Christmas 1919. It is still one of the most popular patterns in America today. The Autumn collection of fine china combines beautiful floral motifs and the jeweled colors of autumn flowers. More than 400 enamel "dots" are hand applied to form the floral and fruit basket design. The ivory fine china, enriched with a gold band, is wrought in the classic Lenox tradition that continues to appeal to every generation, but is perhaps no more in vogue than right now, with the world caught up in Downton fever.
<p> Crafted of Lenox ivory fine china accented with 24 karat gold and enamel jeweling Dishwasher-safe. The set includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, a bread plate, and cup and saucer.
<p> How beautiful is this set? When I look at it, I'm instantly transformed to a large dinner table in the 1900's with royalty. The pattern is classic and timeless and can be used for years to come. A great way to celebrate the season premiere would be to have a Downton Abbey viewing dinner party using this set to serve your guests. How fun would that be? I bet you can envision the party now!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win an Autumn 5-piece place setting from Lenox.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me how if you currently have a set of Lenox dishes. (1 entry)

<p> The post- holiday sales are always an opportunity to find great deals. Whether you're a smart shopper all year long or just love a one-stop bargain, the after Easter sales can help you achieve quite a few shopping needs. A mixture of online and in-store shopping can help you find the best deals around. Although you might head into your post-holiday shopping excursion expecting to just stock up on Easter supplies for next year, you can take advantage of other sales offers to save money for upcoming occasions.
<p> • Great Deals for Next Easter. Post-holiday sales are an excellent time to restock your closet or storage bin for next Easter. Think about the items you need and want the most, as well as those that won't keep for as long. Easter treats and goodies are tempting but they'll never last until next year. But Jesus fish jewelry and other items for Easter can be safely stored until next year.
<p> • Upcoming Birthdays or Anniversaries. Many of the Easter-themed items on sale after the holiday weekend can be used throughout the year. Decorative items, home decor or jewelry with bunnies, chicks and spring flowers aren't exclusive for Easter. Gifts of this nature can be stored or given to someone special on his or her birthday or anniversary. Religious-themed gifts are very popular around Easter but also work well for other days. Shop at your favorite religious store to stock up on bookmarks, books and jewelry at affordable prices.
<p> • Easter Gifts That Work for All Occasions. There's no reason why linens, knickknacks and other decor with religious or nature-based Easter themes can't be used throughout the year. Surprise newlywed couples or someone setting up house with a collection of kitchen towels you got on sale after Easter. Small, inexpensive religious-themed items can be used as stocking stuffers at Christmas. Think universally during your post-holiday shopping to take full advantage of sales.
<p> • Diversify Your Shopping Efforts. Some people enjoy shopping in the stores so they can see and touch the items they're considering buying, while others prefer to shop online in the comforts of their own homes. Regardless of which type of shopping is your favorite, don't overlook the other or you risk missing out on some excellent deals. Online retail and discount stores can help you find the perfect items without having to wake up early or compete with other consumers.
<p> Take Advantage of the ExcitementEven though after Easter shopping isn't as popular or big as the post-holiday shopping season after Thanksgiving or at the end of December, it can still be an exciting and fruitful shopping experience. Expand your line of thinking beyond the Easter holiday to find other effective uses for the goodies, knickknacks and gifts you can pick up while shopping after Easter. Many consumers shop with an eye on items they can use all year around. When you add this tactic to your after Easter shopping practices, you can end up saving money on items usable throughout the year.
<p> As the warmer weather starts to approach, it's time to shift your focus from winter clothing to the cute prints and patterns of spring clothing! There's nothing I love more than looking at the latest spring fashions in Vogue or Elle. I much prefer lightweight skirts and sandals to scarves and winter boots!
<p> Shabby Apple offers stylish women's apparel and accessories. If you're looking for that new spring top or summer dress, Shabby Apple is your online boutique! All of the clothes are so beautiful and they look straight out of a magazine. The clothes have a distinct personality and vintage-y style that I absolutely love. Don't forget to order those gorgeous earrings that will match your new outfit!
<p> I spent my time carefully choosing a dress that I felt that everyone would love. It wasn't an easy decision, but Shabby Apple is graciously allowing one winner to win the Tiber dress. When I saw it, I instantly fell in love with it.Give gondoliers something to swoon over in the sleek and flirty Tiber dress. Bedecked with a tailored bodice, boat neck and elbow-length sleeves, the empire waisted frock hugs close to the body for a figure conscious shape. The knee-length skirt has just a bit of flare which is accentuated by the variegated bands of the Sarah Hansen-designed fabric. For a coy and cosmopolitan combination, wear it with patent t-straps and noir stockings. This dress is made from a leightweight, delicate summer fabric, is unlined, and fits generously on the sizing guide.
<p> The dress would be equally perfect with heels or flats. What I love most about it is that you can dress it up or down for a work or night-time look. Pair it with a gold or red clutch for a great pop of color. It's a classic, timeless pattern that you can wear for years to come!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Tiber dress from Shabby Apple.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me how if you would wear flats or heels with this dress. (1 entry)

<p> I always like to keep up with the latest technological gadgets. A shiny new electronic device is guaranteed to make me happy. Who doesn't like having the internet and fun games on the go either?
<p> Leader International Inc is a manufacturer of high-quality, feature rich Android tablets. The tablets allow you internet access, downloadable apps, a camera and much more! It's like having a hand-held computer at your fingertips!
<p> I've been wanting a tablet with a built in camera for a while. I researched tablets that had the best features and were quality made. Leader International stuck out to me and the fact that the tablets included a camera was a great added bonus!
<p> Leader allowed me to review the Impression 10 inch tablet. I was beyond excited! The touch screen tablet has some very impressive features; it has built in wifi and bluetooth for on the go internet. There's a built-in Samsung A8 processor that is a 1GHz, single-core chip that supports 1080p video recording and playback at 30 frames per second. The camera is 2.0 mega pixels. I wish it had a stronger quality camera though. Also installed is Google Andriod 2.3 platform with flash support, for maximum internet experience. Of course there are hundreds of apps to download at the app store like games, Facebook, Twitter, news, and much more.
<p> When I first received the tablet it had to charge for a while before I was able to use it. The tablet is a sleek and modern black, and is very aesthetically pleasing. What I really liked about the tablet was that it came with a nice black case that matched the tablet. Most tablets do not come with one and you have to buy it separately. After allowing the tablet to charge, I wanted to start using it! It took me a while to get used to an android platform since I am so used to using people's iPads.
<p> I had to read the manual to get a feel for how the device worked. The instructions are easy to follow and user-friendly. In no time I had the tablet running.
<p> The touch screen is very easy to use. Just tap any app you want to open, or if you want to view another page of apps just slide your finger on the background to make that happen.
<p> The internet connection is very fast and in no time you're on the internet browsing and surfing your favorite sites. If you're traveling and don't want to take a heavy laptop with you, a tablet would be a great alternative. It's quick and easy for checking your e-mail or going on Facebook with.
<p> I love the wide range of apps that are available for download too. I quickly downloaded Angry Birds, the Facebook and Twitter app, and some other games too. I enjoy having entertainment and fun at my disposal.
<p> The camera is a handy feature to have and of course I like that it also has a built in video camera too for recording memorable moments. You could also use the video camera for recording a work meeting or conference.
<p> If you're looking for a reliable tablet with many desirable features, please look no further than Leader International Inc.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Leader International Inc for providing me with this complimentary tablet in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Do you remember when you were allowed a quarter to get a gumball out of the machine when you were a child? I know I do. That chewy, sweet and flavorful gum was always desired when at the grocery store or drug store. I used to love the gumball machines that lit up or had a spiral inside. It's time to delight your inner child with the joys of yesterday!
<p> Gumballs.com was created so that everyone could have access to the same high quality, low cost gumball machine and vending supplies that helped them grow to the size they are today. Many different types of exciting gumball and candy machines are offered for sale on the website. Imagine the excitement your child will have when you present them with a gumball machine as a Christmas or birthday present! They will absolutely love it. It would also be equally as great when used at a birthday party.
<p> I was sent a Junior Carousel Machine Gift Set. The machine came with two lbs of gumballs, enough to fill the machine up twice. I enjoyed looking at all of the beautiful colors of the gumballs. What I liked best about the machine was that it had that old time, vintage-y feel that I enjoy. The machine looked like it was straight out of a 1920's candy shop!
<p> The machine is quality crafted and built to last. The combination of the vibrant red and bold silver together is classic and aesthetically pleasing. The Junior Carousel is a smaller version of the classic gumball machine that set the standard for bubble gum machines when they were first introduced in the 1920's - almost 90 years ago! The machine comes put together. It was easy to fill and in no time the glass globe was filled with every color variety of gumballs. I knew I had to try one immediately!
<p> The machine dispenses gumballs with any coin, but can be easily set to work without money. I set it to work without coins and enjoyed a blue gumball that tasted just like I remembered! The gumball came out with ease and did not get stuck inside, and I had no issues twisting the knob either. A great feature of the machine is that you can also use it as a bank. This would be a wonderful opportunity to teach your child about saving money. Have them save their coins inside the bank and be rewarded with a gumball! The coins can be retrieved when the machine is full.
<p> Once the machine is empty, you can fill it with nuts, or any other small candy. Use it to serve some sweet treats at your next party!
<p> The Junior Carousel would be a perfect prsent for an elderly relative to remember the candy shops of their youth. The memories they will revisit will certainly be fun for them!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Junior Carousel Gumball Machine Gift Set from Gumballs.com
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me which color gumball is your favorite. (1 entry)

<p> I'm very particular when it comes to my clothes. I prefer them to look their best and be 100% free of stains at all times. I've tried my fair share of stain removal products, some work and some don't. I'm always on the hunt for that newest stain removal product that provides fantastic results.
<p> America’s dirtiest jobs have to get clean. My Dirty Jobs, LLC has found a way to make it happen with a brand new line of household cleaning products that get America squeaky clean. Inspired by his own show, Dirty Jobs on the Discovery Channel, Mike Rowe became involved with MyDirty Jobs, LLC because of the effectiveness of the products. The creators were open to a new way of marketing the products that appealed to him; they didn’t demonize dirt. The real message is whether it’s as a result of work or play, it’s okay to get dirty. After all, it washes off.
<p> Dirty Jobs Heavy Duty Complete, has a higher concentration of oxygen powered enzymes that is tough on stains, but gentle on fabrics and surfaces than any other stain remover on the market. This makes them perfect for Spring cleaning! The line contains disinfectant spray, all purpose cleaner, carpet foaming cleaner, bathroom cleaner with bleach and more. Each product is made for a specific purpose to make your cleaning experience easier.
<p> I was sent the oxygen complete heavy duty stain remover.
<p> Dirty Jobs Complete Heavy-Duty, Oxygen-Powered Stain Remover can be used as a booster for stain removal in the laundry, a cleaner for dingy bathroom surfaces, for freshening upholstery and fabrics, and it is even safe as a carpet stain remover. The original formula of Dirty Jobs Complete harnesses a higher concentration of oxygen-powered enzymes unlike any other product on the market cutting through grime, grease, stuck-on dirt and set-in stains.
<p> One of the great things about this product is that it's so versatile. I love when items have multiple uses. I accidently got a watermelon stain on a white shirt the other day. The stain remover came at the perfect time to try it out on my shirt. You can use the product in any washer. I used a small amount of the remover in the laundry. It didn't have a harsh smell at all, it was virtually unscented. The remover did a fantastic job of getting the stain out and it was 100% gone when I took it out of the wash. Some stain removers leave a light layer of the stain behind or don't even get it out at all. I wasn't sure how the product would work when I first used it, so I was pleasantly surprised. The size of the tub is perfect for storing in a laundry room or garage for easy access.
<p> I wanted to try the stain remover on something else besides clothing. The faucet in my shower never seems to stay as shiny as I'd like it to, no matter what I do. I took a sponge and put the stain remover to work in the shower. I scrubbed my little heart out and moments later the faucet was shiny and looked brand new! It still looks very nice and clean two days later. I was impressed.

<p> There's nothing quite like a relaxing and refreshing shower. Can't you just picture standing under the hot, soothing water that melts all of your stresses away? A big part of what makes the shower enjoyable is the showerhead. You need a showerhead that has many settings to make your shower experience the best it can be. If you haven't already upgraded your showerhead recently, it's time to indulge!
<p> LevAqua showerheads take showering to the next level of luxury. They sell a range of digital showerheads either fixed or handheld that take offer pampering at the touch of a button! Whether you'd like a full body surround spray or a pulsating massage, LevAqua has you covered. Your shower experience is their top priority.
<p> I had never heard of a digital showerhead before and the thought of it was really intriguing. When I was able to review the LevAqua 220 OneTouch™ Fixed Digital Showerhead, I was really excited! About a year ago I switched out the boring showerhead that was in my shower when I moved into my apartment. I knew I wanted something with more personality, so I found one with some settings. The showerhead was just okay, nothing special.
<p> The LevAqua showerhead was extremely easy to install. The hardest part was taking the old head out. Within minutes, the new showerhead was installed and I was marveling its chrome beauty. The showerhead has ten fantastic settings such as pulsating massage, full body surround spray, massage and full body surround combo and more. The most unique feature is the fact that you can pause the water while you shave your legs, or wash your hair or body. This eco-friendly setting is perfect for saving 20% of water. There's also a timer so you can time your showers, or time it for your children so they don't take too long of a shower.
<p> Not only is the showerhead aesthetically pleasing to look at, I love how wide it is too. The digital touch controls are easy to operate and you can choose which setting you like each time you take a shower. My favorite setting is the pulsating massage. I love to stand underneath the water and let the water hit my back and shoulders, it's very relaxing and gets all of my tension out.
<p> Each time I take a shower it's such an enjoyable spa experience. Now that I have this showerhead, my shower experience has been completely revolutionized.
<p> If you're tired of your same old same old shower routine, it's time to switch it up! Why not bring the spa to your shower and introduce LevAqua into your home?

<p> I would say I'm a pretty girly girl. I wear makeup and do my hair daily, and you'll probably never see me without nailpolish on. I dislike the look of bare nails. I feel that bare nails are just asking to be polished with beautiful colors. Doing my nails always cheers me up and the pretty colors boost my mood. Although I prefer getting my nails done then doing them myself, but who doesn't?
<p> Mark offers you beauty and fashion all in one glamorous site. Tons of makeup and skincare products are available for purchase here. If you're looking for a new sprintime body lotion or shower gel, Mark is your go-to place. The scents of the skincare products are always delicious and make you want to eat them, but please don't. :) You can even start up your own Mark business and make some extra cash on the side.
<p> I have a ton of nailpolish in my bathroom, but that doesn't stop me from wanting more. Just like my hair color which changes all of the time, I always want to try a new color on my hands or feet.
<p> I was sent two beautiful Mark nailed it mini nail lacquers in unique colors, Violet Daze and Tickled Pink.
<p> I usually wear mostly reds or pink hues on my nails during the winter, so these bold colors are perfect for spring and summer.
<p> After I admired the colors for a few moments, I decided I wanted to see them on my nails, rather than just in the bottle. I decided on the Violet Daze for my toes first. The color is really nice, it's loud and full of personality. It easily applied to my toes and was not too thick or too thin. The first coat dried pretty quickly and in no time the second coat was dry too. It looked great on my toes and the color instantly reminded me of summer; sitting on the beach with a great frozen drink. Summer is not too far off and neither are my beach dreams!
<p> The Tickled Pink is really adorable. I think the gorgeous pop of pink is perfect for my nails. The polish is sort of iridescent, in my opinion. With a few quick swipes, my nails were brought to life with the essence of pink! The nailpolish easily applied and dried quickly. When I wear pink, I'm used to bright pink or muted pinks, I've never had a nail polish like this one before and I really welcomed the change. I loved the way it looked on my hands.
<p> The great thing about both of these nailpolishes is that they are very small. The adorable mini size can easily be packed in your suitcase or even put in your purse for quick touch-ups on the go. With Mark, beauty will never be far behind.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Mark for providing me with these complimentary nail polishes in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> In a small saucepan stir together the crushed pineapple, brown sugar and dry mustard. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.
<p> Insert the spit rods evenly through the ham and brush with some of the pineapple mixture. After 45 minutes of rotating, brush with pineapple mixture again. Rotate an additional 10 or 15 minutes, or until the ham reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees. Serve sliced ham with some of the pineapple mixture on top.
<p> Combine the garlic, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, rosemary, ginger and olive oil in a small bowl. Add lamb and turn to coat with marinade. Cover and chill at least 6 hours or up to 1 day turning meat over several times.
<p> Rotate the lamb on the spit rods for 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 135 to 140 degrees for medium on the thermometer, basting several times during the last 10 minutes. Untie, slice and serve!
<p> Both of these recipes sound mouth-wateringly good. Please let me know if you plan on making them!

<p> I've had a love affair with infomercials for a long time. I even did my college senior thesis on infomercials. The catchy jingles, the fun items, and the creative way the commercial is designed is fantastic. The products featured are always something you don't realize that you need until you see them advertised. They are usually designed to make your life easier. You can bet that I want quite a few of the products I see on TV!
<p> Sticky Buddy is the super sticky lint roller that has the power of glue without the goo! Use it to remove cat hair, dog hair, crumbs, cat litter and much more! The Sticky Buddy is safe on all types of fabrics and can be used to clean your clothing, comforters, furniture and even the upholstery in your car. It even has little rubber fingers to reach deep into carpets to remove ground in messes. And the best part is that the Sticky Buddy is reusable! Simply clean it with soap and water and let it air dry. In no time, your Sticky Buddy is sticky again!
<p> When I was allowed to review the Sticky Buddy, I was very much looking forward to it. I had seen the infomercial on TV and knew this product was something I would want to try. I received a full sized Sticky Buddy and a travel sized one too.
<p> I know you're probably thinking, "How is this different from a lint roller?" It's a lot different because a lint roller is not reusable. Eventually you'll use all of the tape and have to buy a new one. With the Sticky Buddy, you'll have a roller for life and you'll only have to pay for it once.
<p> The Sticky Buddy is easy to use for the first time. Simply take the product out of its case and remove the tape. After that you're good to and can use the sticky buddy to remove anything unwanted in your home. The upholestry on my dining room chairs gathers a lot of hair and lint. I took the Sticky Buddy for a whirl on the chairs to see what the results would be. You can easily roll the tool up and down your chairs and hair and dust is easily collected. Sticky Buddy collected a lot within the first few rolls and in no time my chairs were lint free and looking fabulous. No sticky residue is left behind at all. When you're done, simply rinse it and dry it and it's sticky again in moments! The water really does get all of the grime off. Sticky Buddy can easily be stored in its case in a cabinet or drawer for handy access.
<p> If you have dogs or cats this would be wonderful for maintaining your peace and sanity with furniture. Use Sticky Buddy to collect dog or cat hair from furniture and carpets. The helpful little fingers will dig up ground in pet hair in no time. Just use short strokes to make sure you retreive all of the hair.
<p> What I like best about the travel sized Sticky Buddy is that you can keep it on your car or your purse. Use it for a quick touch-up on your clothes right before going into a job interview to make sure you look your best. It's also great for picking up crumbs from your children on car seats or car floors. Just let the little fingers do all of the hard work for you!
<p> The uses for Sticky Buddy are endless, but it's something that I recommend that everyone have in their home.
