<p> A lot of movie watching happens in my house. I'm a big movie fan, so I'm constantly watching the latest flick. When you buy a lot of DVD's, you can only have so many before you start to run out of room in your TV or DVD shelf to store them. Wouldn't it be nice to watch whatever you wanted, any time of day or night, even if you don't own the movie? That's where the Roku steps in!
<p> The Roku is a digital media player which supports signals up to 1080p. It features a built-in wireless networking that allows you to stream media to your TV, so you can enjoy your favorite TV shows, movies and more in stunning high-definition. The Roku library allows you access to more than 100,000 movies and TV shows from Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video and more.
<p> The Roku is a revolutionary device which will change your movie viewing forever!
<p> I was sent a Roku - 2 XD Wireless Digital Media Player.
<p> I had Netflix years ago, but keeping up with sending in the disks and waiting to receive your next one was a pain. I was excited at the thought of watching unlimited movies and tv shows for one low price a month! Of course the fact that I didn't have to deal with the discs was a nice added bonus. I re-signed up with Netflix and couldn't wait to get the Roku party started!
<p> The device was very easy to install and the instructions were clearly explained too. Within about 10 minutes everything was hooked up and ready to go. I had hundreds of TV shows and movies at my fingertips! You can search by movie genre for specifically what you're interested in. The quality is excellent and it's like watching a movie in the theater or from a true DVD. Sometimes the connection will be a bit slower than normal, but that's to be expected. I haven't had any issues with the connection not working at all. You can browse the selections with the included remote. I love seeing old TV shows from years and years ago, it's fun to watch them again. I know that this little black box is going to revamp my movie nights completely! I'm excited to watch many movies that I've never seen before.
<p> The Roku would be the perfect gift for any movie or TV buff. They will absolutely love it if you surprise them with it.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Roku for providing me with a complimentary unit in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> I'm hoping to hit 3,000 GFC in just a few days. I know that you lovely people can help me get there. The contest will end on 2/21 at midnight (or whenever I hit 3,000).

<p> Pretzels are one of my all time favorite snacks. I love those crunchy, salty, little bites of goodness. Don't even get me started on soft pretzels, I can devour those in a minute flat. Here in NYC we have large soft pretzels that are warm, chewy, and soft all in one bite. They are heavenly! There's nothing like a satisfying snack to make your day.
<p> The San Diego Pretzel Company makes assorted types of all natural soft pretzels that are delivered fresh to your door. The company is dedicated and committed to baking and delivering the highest quality soft pretzels. Quality, authenticity, and freshness are their top priorities. Eat, savor, and get twisted with the San Diego Pretzel Company's soft pretzels.
<p> Whether you're looking for jumbo Bavarian pretzels, twisted traditional pretzels, or Philly pretzels, they have you covered plus more! The pretzels are shipped fresh to your door to enjoy within 48 hours or freeze for more pretzel deliciousness later.
<p> I was sent a pack of jumbo Bavarian pretzels. They actually arrived to me tonight and they were beautiful! I couldn't wait to dig in and enjoy one.
<p> The pretzels are a toasty brown color and they are very large! You can heat them in the oven or in the microwave. The pretzels come with a salt pack too. Just put a few drops of water on the pretzel for the salt to stick. I added a little bit of salt and popped my snack into the microwave. In just under 1 minute the pretzel was done.
<p> Look at this beauty!
<p> The pretzel was just perfect! It was warm and had a great chewy firmness to it, but had a balance of softness with it too. I like that I only added a little bit of salt to it, instead of making it extremely salty. The salt gave the pretzel a wonderful boost of flavor. It was also very fresh, it reminded me of one of the soft pretzels you'd get in the mall. It was a very satisfying snack that fulfilled my carbs craving. I'm excited to have one of my favorite snacks waiting for me in the freezer in the coming days.

<p> There's only one computer in my household and it's my boyfriend's. I have my laptop from college but it's painfully slow and very old. So when my boyfriend's using his laptop, I only have my iPad. I can't really blog on my iPad, it's a challenge and doesn't work very well. I used to have to wait to use the computer and that was annoying. Now my days of annoyance are gone!
<p> Sena Cases is a luxury mobile device accessory designer offering classy, stylish protective leather cases for today’s most popular mobile devices. There are cases for phones, smartphones, tablets, laptops, readers, MP3 players and more. The unique cases not only offer an upscale, quality and appearance, but also provide exceptional functionality. The cases are built to last and quality made.
<p> Sena would make an excellent gift for someone who just bought an iPad or a kindle. Let them protect their new electronic device, but also keep it in a stylish case!
<p> I've been wanting an iPad keyboard for a long time. It's hard and frustrating to write emails or surf the web when you keep pushing the wrong letters on the screen. Instead of going to yahoo.com, you go to yafhoo.com. Not quite the same, huh? I've been eyeing various iPad keyboard online and drooling over them, and hoping to own one of them soon.
<p> Well my lucky day eventually came when Sena Cases gave me the opportunity to review a black leather iPad keyboard case. I was sent a black leather keyboard case and I love it! The case also comes in red or orange as well.The case is a sleek black one that is classic. I love black electronics cases, they are always in style and truly look great all the time.
<p> The keyboard is an integrated bluetooth keyboard for iPad 1. It connects to the iPad very easily. Just easily slip the iPad into the case and turn the power switch on. Once you've done that, push the connect button on the top of the case. After that, go into your settings on the iPad and activate the bluetooth setting. The keyboard is then connected with your iPad The case came with no instructions, so I had to go on the website and find them. I do think the case should come with them, because not everyone would think to do that right away. The buttons on the keyboard are easy to push and I had no trouble typing on the iPad at all. I won't make any typo's now!
<p> I love that this small little case turns my iPad into a mini computer! There's a stand that pops out in the back of the case, so as to easily prop the iPad up on a desk or table. The case stands up without any problems. The case easily folds up to be stored in a bag, purse, or drawer too.
<p> I'm really happy that I'll now always have computer access even when my boyfriend's using the laptop! This would be the perfect gift for a technology lover who you normally don't know what to buy for. They will love it! Why not treat yourself too?
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thanks to Sena Cases for providing me with this complimentary case in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> Pets are our babies, and we do whatever we can to make them feel loved, safe, and wanted. Why should we let them have to feel anxiety or be freightened? Pets give us unconditional love and happiness, it's time to give the same back to them!
<p> Thundershirt is the proven solution for dog anxiety. With its patent-pending design, Thundershirt’s gentle, constant pressure has a dramatic calming effect for most dogs if they are anxious, fearful or over-excited. Based on surveys completed by over two thousand customers, over 80% of dogs show significant improvement in symptoms when using Thundershirt. Thundershirt is already helping tens of thousands of dogs around the world, and is recommended by thousands of veterinarians and dog trainers.
<p> If your dog is fearful of loud sudden noises, has travel anxiety, or even hyperacticity, the Thundershirt would be perfect for them.
<p> My dog has very bad separation anxiety. Whenever anybody leaves, she lays by the door and just howls! It doesn't matter if they are gone 10 minutes or 3 hours, she will continuously howl. It's very sad and I feel awful for her. I knew I wanted to do whatever I could to help her.
<p> I received a gray Thundershirt and couldn't wait to try it on her! Even before you open the garage door to my house, you can hear her crying and howling. This happens everytime somebody leaves, without fail. I put the thundershirt on her before I left. It fit her great and looked very cute on. Some dogs may not like wearing it, but Colby didn't seem to mind at all. I told her good-bye and gave her a kiss. She just looked at me and started crying a little bit. I hoped the Thundershirt would calm her down and help her to feel more relaxed while I was gone.
<p> Once I left I was anxious and was hoping that she was okay. Once I got home and went to open my garge door, I heard no crying or howling! Her crying is always very loud! I opened the door and she was laying in the couch wagging her tail. Usually she is laying on the floor howling. She seemed much calmer and happier, and that made me happy too. I was very impressed with the Thundershirt! I think that the more you use it, the better results you will have. This fantastic product has made my Colby's life a lot easier. It truly breaks your heart to hear your baby upset. I will be using this on a constant basis now. Thank you Thundershirt!
<p> This would be the perfect calming aide if you have an anxious dog. Don't let your dog have anxiety for another day!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Thundershirt in their choice of color and size.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> This is my third post for Kiddie Academy. I had never thought about opening a franchise, but this is something that is working well for individuals like Dwight!
<p> Dwight Wilkinson opened his Kiddie Academy, located at 1020 Horsham Road in North Wales, Pennsylvania, on September 8, 2003, at the age of 42. He has remained dedicated to educational excellence, which along with a passion for children’s mental and physcial development, has helped him and his academy achieve success.
<p> Background: As a previous business owner of a Haagen Dazs Ice Cream Shop, Dwight Wilkinson was looking for a business concept that would grant him more time with his wife and four children. He began researching opportunities with a Monday - Friday schedule to help accommodate his family-oriented lifestyle and responsibilities as a community volunteer and coach of his children’s soccer, basketball and baseball teams. Dwight narrowed his search down to the child care franchise industry due to his love of children and managerial background. After two years of looking at child care companies, he chose Kiddie Academy for its warm, caring personality. He found Kiddie Academy to have a vested interest in the success and well-being of their franchisees. He has remained dedicated to educational excellence, which along with a passion for children’s mental and physical development, has helped him and his academy achieve success.
<p> Goals: Dwight often sets goals around educational achievements and finds opportunities for his academy to reach a higher standard. He continually looks to improve the quality of services at his Kiddie Academy, whether through hiring qualified, passionate staff members or adding educational resources. Dwight hopes to grow his academy’s enrollment and is looking into the possibility of opening a second location in the future.
<p> Challenges: Each new generation of parents find a new way to communicate with each other, their children and their child care providers. For Dwight, finding the most effective way to communicate with his families has proved to have its challenges. However, by experimenting with various communication methods, including take home folders, outdoor signage and technology, he has learned more about the consumer and how to reach his target audience.
<p> Results: Dwight’s hard work and commitment has earned him great success. His academy was recently licensed by the Department of Education and accredited by AdvancEd, which is an achievement no other child care in his area can claim. From a personal stance, becoming a Kiddie Academy franchisee has been both fun and rewarding for Dwight. It has given him a better quality of life and allowed him time to spend with his children and family.

<p> I love to polish my nails and I regularly do them. I honestly think it's been years since I've had bare nails. I much prefer beautiful polished nails, than unpolished. I have a huge bag of nail polish in my bathroom that I regularly add to. It's hard to resist a pretty color at the store! The only thing that's annoying is when the nail polish remover doesn't do a good job of taking the color off.
