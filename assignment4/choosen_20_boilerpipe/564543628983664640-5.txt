<p> Everyone's familiar with the widely-known line of Scotch brand tape. You've used it for shipping, moving, and storing, scrapbooking, or even taping your child's artwork up in their room. Now the popular tape has gotten an eco-friendly makeover!
<p> Scotch tape is a brand name used for certain pressure sensitive tapes manufactured by 3M as part of the company's Scotch brand. This brand offers so many useful and helpful products such as scrapbooking glue, mounting and fastening tape, household and office tapes, and more. They are the go-to company for any of your tape needs.
<p> I was sent a great household kit of Scotch products for review. I received a Scotch Magic Eco-friendly tape dispenser, a package of Scotch Magic Eco-friendly tape, a pack of post-it's, and pencils. All of it came easily stored in a convenient storage box.
<p> Scotch Magic Eco-Friendly Tape (including refillable dispenser, packaging and tape) is made from more than 75 percent renewable or recycled materials. The boxed refill roll, including packaging, is made from more than 65 percent renewable or recycled materials. Because of its great adhesive strength, photo-safe formulation and performance, Scotch Magic Tape has been a fixture in homes, schools and offices for 50 years. Scotch Magic Eco-Friendly Tape offers these same great properties, now in an even more environmentally-friendly version.
<p> I honestly would have never guessed that tape could potentially become eco-friendly, but it has! I love that my everyday household products are now taking the step over to the green side, because it's so much better for the environment.
<p> This tape is still the same Scotch tape that we've come to know and love, but the packaging is now much different. It features a calming blue sky with the sun bursting through, and vibrantly green leaves. The packaging is very relaxing, I think. I think it's interesting to use tape that features 75% renewable and/or recycled materials. The tape is still photo-safe and can be written on with pen, pencil or marker. I used this tape to seal up a letter I was mailing yesterday. The tape is frosty on the roll, but quickly turns invisible on paper. I've never used Scotch Magic brand tape before, so I was impressed! I really liked that you could barely see it.
<p> The post-it's will come in handy because I use them all the time to write down things I need to remember, or important phone number's, etc. The pencils are great too because you can always use more pencils. I seem to always be losing mine too.

<p> Waffles are the perfect start to a great morning. What's better than a scrumptious, warm blueberry waffle with a drizzle of maple syrup on it? Nothing if you ask me! Everyone loves waffles, they are a quick and easy breakfast in the morning when you are on the go.
<p> Eggo is a brand of frozen waffles in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which is owned by the Kellogg Company. Several varieties are available, including original, blueberry, and chocolate chip. The waffles are bursting with flavor and truly delicious.
<p> Eggo has recently come out with a new line of waffles, called Eggo Fiberplus. These waffles have a crispy, golden outside and warm and fluffy inside as other Eggo products, but they also are an excellent source of fiber, satisfying 35 percent of the daily recommended value. They are offered in two flavors: chocolate chip and buttermilk. The chocolate chip variety provides 20 percent of the recommended daily value of the antioxidants, Vitamin E and Zinc, while the buttermilk option offers 35 percent of the recommended daily value of calcium. Isn't it great to still have a great tasting breakfast while getting your daily intake of fiber too?
<p> I was sent both varieties of the new line to try for review purposes. I've had the great pleasure of trying both of these flavors of waffles previously, but not with the new Fiberplus. Both waffles heat up quickly in the toaster and are ready to enjoy in just mere minutes. They have a perfect golden color to them. I love when the syrup pools up in the squares because each bite contains an equal amount of syrup-y goodness :). The warm waffle has the slightest bit of chew but is still firm and fluffy. Waffles are so comforting and bring you back to your childhood.
<p> You can truly taste the chocolate chips in the chocolate waffle, but it's a very subtle hint of chocolate. It's not overly sweet and rich, but a fabulous treat in the morning. The buttermilk has a classic taste to it. If you still feel that you need a hint of flavor, how about adding some cut up strawberries or a few blueberries on top? That should kick-start your day instantly!
<p> I think that it's excellent that Eggo has noted people's health concerns and stepped up to still make breakfast tasty, but include health benefits too.
<p> I was also sent a $5 Starbucks giftcard with the waffles too which I'm sure will come in handy for breakfast :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win both new varieties of Eggo Fiberplus waffles, plus a $5 Starbucks giftcard to really kick off their breakfast right! YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> I've finally hit my 10 lb weight loss goal on Nutrisystem. ! It feels great to have 10 lbs gone and I love the way that I feel now. It's also awesome to be able to say I've lost 10 lbs! I've been following the diet regularly and been exercising a few times a week.
<p> I haven't really had any cravings and I've stuck to the diet for the most part 100%. Of course sometimes I slacked a little, but that comes with any diet. I feel full after I eat the food and it truly fills me up. I've noticed that even when dining out and I order diet-friendly food, I can barely finish it. I am used to eating small portions and I love how my body is used to very small meals for the past few months. It's a great part of the diet.
<p> I am approaching my goal weight (I have maybe another 5 or 10 pounds to go, not too much more to lose!) I hope the weight comes off easily, but I know it takes work.
<p> I hope to have more exciting news next week!

<p> Italian food is my absolute favorite. Having a plate of pasta with the slighest bit of chew topped with a luscious blend of cheeses, and a thick hearty marinara is my idea of heaven! I love how Italian food is so much about experimentation with spices and flavors too.
<p> Brio Tuscan Grille is an Italian restaurant in select locations around the United States. The restaurant brings the pleasures of the Tuscan country villa to the American city. The food is always fresh, delicious, and comforting. Find a location near you here. If you're in the mood for a nice glass of wine and some appetizers, Brio has a $2.95 bar menu for appetizers featured only in the restaurant's bar during weekday hours. The times may vary by restaurant though.
<p> I've had the delicious pleasure of dining at Brio several times over the past year. My favorite dishes at Brio are the margherita flatbread and the ravioli caprese. Both dishes were just divine! The flatbread was not too soft and not too hard, but just right. The mozzarella cheese was fresh and bursting with flavor. The tomatoes were also very ripe and juicy too. The basil garnish was the finishing touch to a delicious meal. The ravioli caprese was heavenly. All of the flavors combined were out of this world and the ravioli was warm, comforting and delicious. I couldn't ask for a better dining experience at Brio! Every time I've dined there, the waitstaff is always attentive and very friendly. I will keep coming back to Brio time and time again!
<p> Brio would be awesome for a Mother's day lunch or brunch because they have a special menu for Mom's day!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a $50 gift card to Brio, plus a $10 bonus gift card valid June 27 through September 25, 2011.

<p> We all need a little treat once in a while, right? We have to indulge, it's human nature to want to. Although sometimes we overdo it. Thanks to Mac-N-Mo's, we can still enjoy yummy treats in a much healthier way.
<p> Mac-N-Mo's was started in 2010 when the owner Maura, was trying to find a healthier solution to baked goods for her dad who loved sweets, but also is a diabetic and has a restrictive diet. All of the treats are vegan free, sodium free, sugar free, gluten free, and preservative free. The baked goods come in morsels (very small treats) or regular-sized cookies.
<p> I was sent three different kinds of morsels. I received peanut butter spice, chocolate chip, and pumpkin cranberry. (Pumpkin spice morsels)
<p> (Pumpkin cranberry morsels)
<p> (Chocolate chip morsels)
<p> I think these morsels are a fantastic idea for anyone who loved baked goods, but is trying to weed out all of the unnatural and bad for you ingredients that most cookies and sweets contain. The morsels are very unique, and unlike anything I've ever had before. I love how small they are, they are just the right size for curbing your sweet tooth, but still letting you induldge too. All of Mo's treats contain organic ingredients.
<p> The chocolate chip was my favorite. All of the morsels have a very "earthy" taste that could possibly take some getting used to, but in the end I came to really enjoy them. They also have a semi-crunchy consistency. The chocolate morsel was not overly sweet or rich, but it was still very delicious! I really liked it combined with the almonds, unsweetened coconut, and the organic quinoa. It gave it a nice crunch and diversity of flavors. The morsel only contains 1 gram of sugar, so you can still have your chocolate and eat it too without worrying about having too much sugar in your diet!
<p> The pumpkin cranberry morsel had very similiar ingredients as the chocolate chip morsel. I am not a big fan of cranberries in baked goods, so I wasn't too crazy about the cranberries. I do love pumpkin though, so this was right up my alley. The pumpkin in the recipe is organic, which is important to me. I am not sure which spices Mo uses in her recipe, but I love them! It gave the treat such a unique flavor that left me wanting more. Just delicious!
<p> Lastly, I tried the peanut butter spice flavor. I do love peanut butter, so I knew I would really enjoy this one as well. This morsel reminded me of Christmas time where everyone makes spice cakes or some kind of spiced dessert. I've never tried a morsel like this before and it was very interesting. I loved the aspect of smooth and creamy peanut butter combined with hearty spices, it was just fabulous!. It was a very comforting treat that I would love to sit around and eat with friends on a cold or rainy night. Mac-N-Mo's is right, their treats are magical!
<p> Mo's says: Since there are no preservatives, remember to eat them right away or freeze (if they last that long). For extra morselicousness, pop them in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds before eating.
<p> One lucky winner will win a Mac-n-Mo's Morselicious Mix! It can be used for morsels, pancakes, muffins, cakes,casseroles... a healthy gluten and sodium free &amp; sugar gree replacementfor any dish requiring flour, etc. This is a plain mix and the recipient can add their own spices and sweeteners to taste.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Mac-N-Mo's Morselicious Mix.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me what spices or sweeteners or even ingredients you use would use to experiment with this mix. (1 entry)

<p> Sparkling beverages are one of life's little pleasures. The sweet drink accompanied by a layer of refreshing and almost addictive bubbles is just the best!
<p> With a strong tradition for integrity, innovation and variety, the R.W. Knudsen Family brand proudly marks its 50th anniversary this year They are committed to producing healthful fruit products that have never contained artificial flavors, preservatives or added sugar. The R.W. Knudsen Family has established itself as a favorite organic and natural choice in households across the U.S.
<p> I had not previously had the opportunity to try any of R.W. Knudsen's beverages, but now I had the great pleasure to!
<p> I was sent a commemorative bottle of R.W. Knudsen's sparkling grape juice celebrating their 50th anniversary!
<p> The bottle is very fancy and it feels like I'm about to have a glass of champagne on New Year's, but it's really grape juice! The juice was very sweet, a little too sweet for me though. It was still tasty though. The color of the grape juice was a very deep and beautiful purple. The drink fizzed up nicely and the bubbles were definitely in abundance. This is certainly a grown up version of the classic child favorite of grape juice. I do like that the beverage had no added sugar, preservatives or any artificial flavors. This is very important to me. This would be a fun drink to share with friends or family over a delicious meal.
<p> This bottle is not available in stores anywhere, so you have an awesome opportunity to win a product that isn't available at all to buy!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TEN (10) winners for this contest. Ten winners will win a 50th anniversary commemorative bottle of R.W. Knudsen's grape juice. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> I'm all for products that make people's lives easier. Whether it's an electric screwdriver instead of a manual one, or even a tool that is new and improved to do a better job than the original. I think convenience and usability is very important in marketing a product.
<p> Irwin Tools is an American manufacturer and distributor of hand tools and power tool accessories. It is most well known for producing Vise-Grip locking pliers. Additionally, the company produces clamps, drill bits, saw blades, pipe wrenches, screwdrivers, snips, and other construction tools. Whatever your construction needs may be, Irwin Tools is at your service to help.
<p> I was sent a 20" Irwin universal handsaw. This is a serious handsaw!The great features of the 20" handsaw:Unique Handle Design – The patent-pending unique handle-to-blade design, combined with the patented universal triple-ground teeth, completely eliminates binding and cuts three times faster than traditional handsaws through virtually any material.
<p> Patented Universal Tooth Grind – The patented universal tooth grind rapidly removes material, delivering the speed that’s expected from a coarse-cutting saw with the fine finish of a fine-cutting saw in most standard building materials.
<p> Comfort Grip Handle – The comfort handle is constructed of a high density resin and molded into an ergonomic grip. This handle is lighter than traditional handsaws resulting in less hand fatigue.
<p> The Blade Profile – The blade profile has a tapered-pitch nose for improved clearance through materials and stability with every stroke.
<p> Thick Body Blade – The thick body saw blade is .85 mm thick with a water based lacquer coating, delivering a faster, more controlled cut.90° and 45° Markings – The 90° and the 45° angle markings are fast and convenient features, providing a reliable straight edge for quickly marking work surfaces.
<p> I gave this saw to my dad because his old handsaw wasn't functioning well anymore. He has various Irwin tools in his toolbox and trusts them for reliability and durability. So I knew that this handsaw would be nothing less than the best. My dad used it for sawing off a very old tree limb in his backyard. He loves how easy it is to hold and he can grip it comfortably while using it. He said the teeth of the saw cut through the limb practically effortlessly and he was extremely impressed. His old saw took him much longer to saw off old tree limbs, but this limb was off in no time thanks to Irwin! The blade of the saw was thick and allowed him to cut more at a faster speed. He will definitely be turning to this tool for any sawing needs he may have in the future.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 20" universal handsaw from Irwin Tools.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Since I am on NutriSystem I've been exercising regularly. It's nice to incorporate something fun into the mundane treadmill, elliptical, etc routine. You trick your mind a little bit into thinking that you're not really exericising but dancing!
<p> Zumba is an aerobic fitness program created by Miami-based dancer and choreographer Beto Perez and two entrepreneurs, Alberto Perlman and Alberto Aghion. It originated in Colombia in the 1990s and is taught by some 20,000 instructors in 35 countries.
<p> Zumba has 12 million class participants, has sold 10 million DVDs, and is available in 110,000 locations in 125 countries. Pretty impressive, right?
<p> Step by Step: Breaks down the basics of the 24 different steps viewers will use throughout the series including merengue, salsa, reggaeton, calypso, cumbia and belly dance
<p> Activate: In this full workout for beginners, viewers will begin to harness the organic energy of the Zumba program
<p> Ripped: Features Zumba Sentao™ and Zumba® Toning programs. Begins with a toning workout featuring the exclusive Zumba weighted toning sticks that double as maracas and ends with a breakthrough Zumba Sentao chair routine designed to build lean muscle and define the entire body
<p> Exhilarate: A 60-minute Zumba fitness-party in a music video setting
<p> Rush: A 20-minute express workout for those on the go.
<p> Mix: The international fitness-party experience featuring percussionist The Bash Man, new dance styles and traditionally adorned representatives from cultures all over the world
<p> Fitness-Concert: Viewers can follow along to the fitness-concert held at the annual 2010 Zumba Instructor Convention where more than 3,500 instructors came together to party.
<p> I chose to review the activate disc because I am on a beginner's level. I wanted to get a feel for the dance moves and introduce myself to it slowly. I really had fun doing it although it did kick my butt! The program requires so much energy and you get to experience many different types of "dance workouts." This would be an awesome way to motivate someone to shed some weight if they are tired of the gym. I did it in the middle of my living room and had no issues with being bored or lack of motivation. I am excited to spice up my workout routine too. I will be using this program for my nightly exercise.
<p> Lately my skin has been looking really good. It's the first time in a long time that I can honestly say that when I look in the mirror, I like what I see. I realize that summer is approaching and I'd like to replenish my skin from the harsh winter wind and keep it looking great.
<p> Dermacyte Oxygen Concentrate spans a unique and ultra-soothing formula that helps restore a youthful glow to your skin. Your complexion appears instantly brighter and energized after it is applied. Apply morning and night onto clean skin before any other products. Think of Dermacyte Oxygen Concentrate as an oxygen bar for your skin!
<p> Oxygen might not be the first beauty ingredient that pops into your mind when looking for a product, but it should be. Offering a revitalizing solution to your skincare needs, oxygen purifies, moisturizes, and heals skin, restoring youthfulness and radiance. This is something that Oxygen Biotherapeutics has known for years, and with its recently launched products, Dermacyte Oxygen Concentrate and Oxygenating Eye Complex, you can actually harness oxygen’s powers to overcome common skin problems.
<p> The top four reasons that oxygen should work its way into your daily routine, and why:Assists in the production of collagen (the skin’s structural support), which suffers over time as the circulation of oxygen in our bodies begins to decrease and the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to dermal tissues deteriorates.
<p> Helps repair elastin, the protein that enables tissues to resume their original shape (even after being stretched!), combating time and outside factors that harm skin.
<p> Aids in purifying and replenishing the skin, eliminating any imperfection or dull, dry appearance associated with the deterioration of oxygen circulation.
<p> I was sent a 15 ml pump of Dermacyte Oxygen Concentrate. I was excited to be able to review such a unique product, but also I was curious of the results too.
<p> I tried this product for the first time a few days ago. The pump is very small and you only need a very small amount to get you started. The consistency is similiar to lotion, but much much, much thinner. The product rubs in basically in one "rub" into your skin, and it's absorbed so easily and it feels like silk on your skin. I am sure that it has something to do with the oxygen concentrate in the product. This is unlike any other product I've ever used before though. I have already noticed from just a few uses that my skin looks brighter, revitalized, and much healthier. I am very satisfied with the results. I've been using this in the morning and then again at night before bed. I'm sure in no time it will do wonders for my skin and help restore the damage. This product is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

<p> I haven't lost any weight this week on Nutrisystem. I don't know why :(. I stepped on the scale and I was the exact same weight from last week. I worked out but had some very busy days last week where I didn't have as much veggies and fruit as I should have. That's my fault though.
<p> I am also feeling like I hit a plateau and it feels hard to get the weight off, I hope to kick this plateau though!
<p> I am back on the wagon for this week and looking to get some more weight off! :)
<p> Total weight lost=8 lbs.
<p> *Nutrisystem is providing their program free of charge for my participation in the Nutrisystem Nation Blogging Program.
<p> I've been using Vicks products for as long as I can remember. The NyQuil helps with colds and of course the VapoRub is a necessity in my medicine cabinet for cough and cold congestion.
<p> A little over a month ago I was sent an email from Vicks saying they wanted to send a special item to me for being a top product review blogger, but couldn't tell me what it was. All they could say was that it involved the power of touch (much like Vicks VapoRub does.) I love surprises but the suspense always kills me! Finally the day arrived and Fed-Ex delivered a small box. I opened the package and saw a beautiful new iPad staring back at me! I did not know what to think and I was in shock. It was the coolest present ever and I was not expecting it! I had been wanting an iPad but never would have thought I would be sent one through my blog!This tool was for experiencing the power of touch!
<p> The iPad is pre-loaded with the recently launched Vicks Facebook page and press releases, fact sheets, and pictures of the Vicks brand. I love having the Facebook page and information at my disposal anytime I would like advice from the Vicks community and fans. It's also great for discussing how awesome the brand is too. I know it will come in handy any time I feel sick :)
<p> *I was not compensated for posting about the Vicks brand, but I did receive an iPad in order to experience the new VapoRub Facebook page and the power of touch.
