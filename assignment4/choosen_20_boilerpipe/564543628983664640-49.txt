<p> There are some desserts that are timeless and loved by all. A brownie filled with pretzel bits and toffee may not be wanted by everyone, but a piece of pound cake will always please everyone. You can't go wrong with pound cake. It is delicious, light and fluffy, and goes great with ice cream. I think I hear it calling my name right now, better not keep it waiting!
<p> The Cake Crate Co specializes in an assortment of mini gourmet pound cakes. While their cakes are personal sized we guarantee you will not miss any of the full southern flavor. Offering more than 20 flavors (10 full flavored cake in a petite size.) With attention to detail and quality no matter what cake you choose it will be made with the finest and freshest ingredients. Delivered in its own mini natural wood handcrafted crate, each cake recipe has been and will be born in the south to assure we don't compromise the southern tradition or experience.
<p> The adorable mini cakes come in many mouth watering flavors such as s'mores (which is the flavor of the month), peach cobber, strawberry, banana, lemon, chocolate, blueberry, apple pie and many more. Which flavor sounds best to you?
<p> I chose to review chocolate, because if you know me, you know I love my chocolate. The cake showed up in a cute "crate" tied with string.
<p> As I carefully opened the crate, I couldn't wait to see what the hand-crafted confectionery treat that was inside looked like.
<p> This was the beauty that I laid my eyes on. My favorite thing about the cake was probably the size. I've never seen a pound cake that little before and I thought it was the best thing ever! It would be the perfect size to indulge with a friend and not feel overly guilty. You could also give these as a gift for the upcoming Holiday season. If you present this to a friend or family member, they will absolutely love it.
<p> I cut myself a small piece and poured an ice cold glass of milk. I took my first of many bites. I instantly noticed that the cake was very fresh and full of fantastic flavor that only a pound cake could provide. It was dense, but not overly dense, but also was light and fluffy at the same time. The chocolate chips were sprinkled in throughout the cake, ensuring a chocolate experience with each bite. The chocolate was rich and sweet and gave the cake an added note of sweetness, which I really loved. Since the cake is small, you don't feel as guilty for enjoying since the piece that you would have would be very small. The treat was sweet, but not overly sweet. It definitely satisfied my sweet tooth though. I really enjoyed the cake and look forward to having another piece and trying the other flavors soon!
<p> A cake from The Cake Crate Co would be great to take to someone as a thank you present, a housewarming gift, or even as a hostess gift for someone hosting a dinner party or get together. Whichever cake you choose, your recipient will be thrilled to receive it.

<p> Greek yogurt is loaded with protein, it's a tasty source of calcium, and makes a great midday snack as it's filling and satisfies hunger longer.

<p> I'm always looking for the hottest and newest restaurants in Manhattan to check out. New restaurants are always bursting onto the scene, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with them all. When I heard about the Hill, I was intrigued.
<p> I recently attended the launch for NYC based match maker and the reality star of Bravo's Miss Advised, Amy Laurent's first book (8 Weeks to Everlasting). The signing, and wine/cupcake happy hour, was held at The Hill, a small establishment on 29th and 3rd avenue. The website describes it as "an upscale sports bar," I describe it as a great place to do more than just watch sports. It's a double level layout, bar and bar table lower and bar-lounge like upper, make it an ideal place to hang out, have dinner, and catch the game.
<p> The dining room has a very modern and inviting decor. There are flat screens everywhere, enough to probably have every concurrent sporting event running at any given time. The warm seasons have an outside dining option, in case you want a cafe atmosphere before you catch the entertainment bar vibe inside. The crowd consisted of professionals in their 20s and 30s, a good place for singles to go after a long day of work. It would also be a great place to grab a drink with friends on a weekend night, or to even have a private event at. I was there on a Monday night, and it was packed, which is a good sign that it's hopping all week long.
<p> The best part of The Hill is the menu. The prices are more than reasonable, which is often hard to find in Manhattan, especially at any place that calls itself "upscale." The bar food type menu has a nice variety for any palette, featuring appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. I had fresh hummus with whole wheat soft pita chips and mozzarella sticks. My husband got a plate of adorable chicken parm sliders. We both enjoyed our meals and the portions were generous, I don't think either one of us finished our food. The only downside was a limited beer selection (no Yingling or Heineken to my husband's dismay) and no iced tea (how unusual is that?) However, if you can live without iced tea and specific beers, and are looking for a great place to go for a quick bite that satisfies both the belly and the wallet The Hill is a great bet. There's even a reasonably priced garage next door too for quick and convenient parking!

<p> Comfort foods provide you with a warm sense of life and happiness. Foods on this level are best shared with a group of friends over great conversation and lots of laughs. Alexia's high quality and delicious products definitely fit this category well.
<p> Alexia offers all natural foods, trans fat free foods, organic foods, flavorful appetizers and premium artisan blends of items. Once you try Alexia, you will be hooked! The foods are rich and full of flavor and certainly not lacking on delicious taste. Whether you're looking for onion rings, sweet potato fries or puffs, waffle fries, ciabatta rolls or mozzarella sticks, Alexia has you covered and offers much more. You'll instantly fall in love with their delicious frozen foods.
<p> I'm a big fan of their sweet potato fries and regularly buy and eat them. I'm always on the lookout for new products in their potato line. When I was contacted to review their lemon parmesan fries, I was very excited to try them. The combination of lemon and parmesan together intrigued me.
<p> I made my fries to go alongside turkey burgers. The fries bake in the oven for some minutes until they are golden brown and delicious. I much prefer waffles fries to regular stick-sized fries. I think waffle fries offer more depth, flavor, and potato-y goodness!
<p> Once the fries were done, I couldn't wait to try them. Each large fry was covered in a generous blanket of seasoning. They also smelled out of this world. I love any food that involves cheese, so I knew that these fries had my name written all over it. The fry was perfectly crispy and warm and bursting with potato flavor. The flavor of the cheese and lemon was not overly recognizable. I could taste the lemon flavor with certain bites, but it was not very strong. The parmesan flavor was recognizable more so, I'd say. You could definitely tell there was some flavor there, the fries were not bland at all. I enjoyed them and they paired very well with the turkey burgers as a side dish.
<p> I can't wait to see what other products Alexia comes out with in the future, you know I'll be trying them. :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a free product coupon for any Alexia product and a set of 4 Alexia branded wine charms.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> I don't believe that there has to be a necessary occasion to have cake. Yes, it's required at a birthday party, holiday, or any other celebration. Why can't you have cake for just no reason though? How about a nice slice of chocolate cake or strawberry cheesecake just because you feel like it? There's no time like the present to indulge in a yummy treat.
<p> Chez Moi products unique, specialty bakery cakes. The cake line includes 7 different flavors of rum cake and 1 vodka cake. The rum cake flavors are brown sugar vanilla, chocolate raspberry, coconut, pineapple and black cherry. Don't forget that they also have banana and white chocolate raspberry too! The vodka cake comes in appletini. They offer high-quality, made-from-scratch desserts that are not found in an everyday bakery.
<p> When I received the opportunity to review a brown sugar vanilla rum cake, I was looking forward to the opportunity. I had previously tried rum cakes before and really enjoyed them. How can you go wrong with adding rum to a cake? It really adds a sophisticated flavor.
<p> My cake arrived fairly quickly and came very nicely presented in a tin. When I opened the tin, I didn't expect the cake to be so large. The cake was a very decent size and smelled fantastic. I knew I couldn't wait to taste it! You can even reuse the tin to give Christmas cookies in to a friend or relative during the holidays.
<p> The cake looked extremely freshly baked--like it was baked just moments before being sent to me! The color of the cake was beautiful, a toasted almond outside with a beautiful golden center.
<p> I took my first bite of the cake. I instantly noticed how moist and fluffy it was, it was like eating a cloud made out of cake! The cake was extremely fresh and bursting with wonderful brown sugar and vanilla flavor. I did notice the rum, but the flavor was subtle. It complimented the brown sugar and vanilla excellently. The flavor of the cake was sweet, but not too sweet that you couldn't eat it. I loved the combination of each of the flavors together, it was like magic. There was nothing about this cake that I did not like. Each bite was better than the last. I truly enjoyed it. I am looking forward to trying other Chez Moi cake flavors in the future.
<p> The brown sugar sort of crystallized the crust and made it crunchy during the baking process. You can see it well in this picture.
<p> This cake would be perfect to give any sweet treat lover as a holiday gift, or a "I'm just thinking of you present." This is not an ordinary, every day cake that everyone's had time and time again. It's a cake that everyone will love and want to know where it's from. Serve this at a party and you'll be the talk of the town!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Chez Moi for providing me with this complimentary cake in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

Who wouldn't want that? What I love most features to revolutionize our cell phone experience.

<p> Brownies are the solution to all of my problems. They taste fantastic and make everything better. Who doesn't love a fresh, warm out of the oven brownie with a cold glass of milk? just the thought of that makes my mouth water. I believe everyone should indulge in a brownie whenever they can. :)
<p> In 1992, Sheila G. Mains, better known in the food business as Sheila G, took a treasured family recipe for fudge brownies and baked her way into a thriving business. You may even have tasted one of her rich, dense squares of heaven at some of our nation’s finest restaurants and theme parks. So, where exactly did the inspiration for her scrumptious new snack brownie brittle come from?
<p> Like many brownie aficionados, Sheila is particularly fond of the crispy edges. In fact, on many an afternoon she would walk through the bakery gathering the brittle batter off the sides of the sheet pans as the brownies cooled in their racks. It had that same rich chocolate taste, but with an amazing crunch. That started her wondering: How could she create a whole pan of crunchy edges? Well, lucky for us, she figured it out! Now you too can satisfy your sweet tooth in a snap with Sheila G’s Brownie Brittle!
<p> If you love the sweet taste of chocolate brownies but also enjoy the crunchiness of brittle, this treat has your name written all over it. When I found out I was going to review something as delicious as this, I couldn't wait to try it! I've always been a fan of brownie edges.
<p> I was sent 3 bags of Brownie Brittle, toffee crunch, traditional walnut, and chocolate chip. The chocolate chip was absolutely my favorite.
<p> I instantly gravitated towards the chocolate chip, because the more chocolate, the better. Once you open the bag, there are large pieces of the brittle inside. The pieces are oblong and bursting with chocolate goodness. What I liked best about the brittle is that you can have 6 big pieces for 120 calories, which is enough to satisfy your chocolate craving. The brittle was a gorgeous deep brown color and dotted with large dark chocolate chunks. I took a bite and the brittle was satisfyingly crunchy. It wasn't overly dense or thick, but very thin and crunchy. The brittle itself wasn't an extremely sweet chocolate, but the chocolate chips kicked the sweet notch up. I loved it! I instnatly had to have another piece, or two or three! It was addictive. The perfectly crunchy brittle was all that I could ask for in a snack. It would pair very well with a cold glass of milk, or even with a nice glass of wine for an evening treat.
<p> The traditional walnut brittle also was created in large pieces. Big walnut pieces were coming out of the brittle at all angles. The nutty walnuts had a nice flavor and gave the brittle an extra crunch which my taste buds loved! I enjoyed each bite of the brittle.
<p> The final brittle that I tried was the toffee crunch. The large toffee pieces were generously scattered throughout the crunchy treat. The tofee pieces were definitely noticable when enjoying the treat and the toffee added an extra sweetness to an already yummy confectionary snack. I didn't like that the toffee got stuck in my teeth though.
<p> All in all, these are a great treat that would make any chocoholic's mouth water. A crunchy treat with a big taste would make anyone happy.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win all 3 flavors of Brownie Brittle.
<p> Winner will be chosen on August 20th, 2012 at 10 pm and then will be emailed. One entry per day. Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours.

<p> I believe a woman should have many purses. You can't just have one. You have to have certain purses in certain colors, and you have to have ones that are for certain seasons. I love having a variety of purses that are all different styles, each to go with how I feel for the day. Sometimes I want to use a classic purse, other times a purse loud with buckles and zippers.
<p> The Olivia + Joy collection represents the hottest handbag and accessories styles of the moment delivering the right trend at the right time. I love the bags featured in each season collection. They are full of style and personality and are really beautiful. I enjoyed browsing the Spring and Summer 2012 collection, there were so many bags I wished were mine!
<p> I finally settled on reviewing a gorgeous black purse that I instantly fell in love with when I saw it.
<p> The black purse is perfect because it goes with anything you wear, and you can use it all year round. The gold hardware is beautiful and really stands out against the black. The material seems durable and well-made. There's a detachable shoulder strap that I took off, because I prefer carrying the purse on my wrist. The bag is extremely roomy inside and there's so much room for holding practically anything you need. You could even store a change of clothes in there! Make sure to keep your essentials in there like your phone, wallet, notepad, keys, etc. There are pockets inside the bag that you could keep things handy in like your phone or keys to have them handy.
<p> There is a storage pocket on the outside of the purse which secures with a gold accessory that you twist shut. It's nice that this purse offers so many pockets and is so roomy. I love the way it looks and the style is just what I like.
<p> This purse is definitely going to be used quite frequently!

<p> If there's anything that I love in this world, you know it's delicious food. Anything savory and full of flavor is right up my alley. I enjoy spending time with friends while indulging in a fabulous Italian or Thai dish. Conversation makes food all the better! Wouldn't it be great if you could get great food and snacks all in one place, (besides the grocery store?)
<p> Goodies for Gifts is a company dedicated to helping consumers find unique edible presents. Goodies For Gifts features companies from across the country known for fabulous foods that can easily be bought and shared with their loved ones for their birthdays, holidays or any day. They offer a range of different food categories made fresh and shipped to your door. Whether you're looking for a cheesecake, lobster, coffee, tea, candy, or more, Goodies for Gifts has it. I was browsing their website and drooling over each vendor. I wish I could take a piece of cheesecake through the computer screen from one of their cheesecake vendors. Yum!
<p> I was sent a tin of Colossal Cookie Crunch Fudge from Big Little Fudge, one of the vendors on Goodies for Gifts. Big Little Fudge, a great new fudge born in the little town of Montgomery, Texas, where they like to do things just a little bit bigger. So, you might be a tad confused ‘bout the small size of their Big Little Fudge. Truth is, there’s more crunchy, nutty, coconutty per square inch than a Texas mile. That’s THE fudge factor – where small isn’t really small at all. One taste and you’ll know, they’re not messin’ around. 1 Spunky Little Fudge. 12 Seriously ‘Big’ Flavors. Big Little Fudge is a sweet treat and fudge lover's dream. If you want coconut fudge, almond fudge, pecan fudge, and any other combination, they are your go-to fudge headquarters! They mix a lot of flavors together for a maximum great taste.
<p> The Colossal Cookie Crunch is definitely a work of art. The pieces of fudge were very dense and large, and beautiful.
<p> When the tin of fudge arrived, I put it in the fridge immediately. I prefer my fudge to be very cold. I don't like when it's room temperature. As I anxiously waited for the fudge to chill, I knew my sweet treat dreams were coming true very soon! When the fudge was cool enough, I took one out of the tin to enjoy. I liked the separate layers of the fuge, the bottom is plain chocolate, and the top is the vanilla fudge with cookies. How can you go wrong when pairing vanilla and chocolate? You can't, it's a classic combination!
<p> As I took my first bite of the fudge, the creaminess enveloped my taste buds. I instantly noticed the sweet taste of the vanilla fudge paired with the rich taste of the chocolate fudge. The bite was dense and full of wonderful flavor. The fudge was sweet but not overly sugary-sweet. I could easily distinguish the vanilla and chocolate flavor from each other, but they did compliment each other wonderfully too. The cookie bits added a nice added touch of personality to the treat. I really enjoyed the fudge and it was hard to not have too many at one time. A piece of fudge would go great with a nice glass of wine.
<p> Any fudge from Big Little Fudge would make a wonderful birthday present, Christmas present, a hostess gift, or a I'm just thinking of you gift. You can't go wrong with fudge and everyone will appreciate it.

<p> Yoga is very important for your health. The benefits of stretching are great for your bones, and yoga also helps to reduce stress. What can be better than reducing stress and exercising at the same time? It's essential that you have a great yoga mat to receive the maximum benefits of yoga!
<p> Aurorae Yoga offers the best yoga mats including long and thick yoga mats, bags, props, packages, and yoga accessories. Whatever your yoga need may be, Aurorae Yoga provides it. The mats come in different colors and patterns so you can find one that best suits you.
<p> I was sent a pink Classic Hope Yoga Mat. I've previously had a yoga mat, but it was old and getting time to replace it. I love the color pink, it's full of fun and personality, and I wanted to carry that over to my yoga sessions too.
<p> The mat is durable, thick and perfect for my beginner's level of yoga. The bright pink is cute and stands out when I'm in yoga class. The mat is comfortable to do my positions on and I have no issues with it not staying flat on the floor or anything like that. It fits securely in my yoga bag and zips closed perfectly. I've been enjoying the mat so far and look forward to using it for some time to come!

<p> Healthy Skin is a concern for some people. There are many different ways to achieve healthy skin beyond maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Some of these skin care techniques can be incredibly expensive and hard to maintain. There are sometimes less expensive alternatives or ways to find discounts that can soften the impact of spending money on beauty products.
<p> Healthy FoodThe appearance of the skin is affected by the type of foods that are eaten. The most inexpensive foods like processed meats and refined carbohydrates can cause acne or redness. Healthy skin requires healthy food. The healthiest choices are often very expensive. Some of these costs can be offset by searching for store coupons, checking in-store discount racks and by looking for manufacturer rebates. Even lettuce growers sometimes offer a small amount of cash back for loyal customers who are willing to wait for the savings.
<p> Skin Care ProductsSome beauty products that make a visible difference to the skin can cost hundreds of dollars for a fraction of an ounce. Some skin care systems are even more expensive and require daily use for months. Products that are sold at certain retailers can be purchased for less using the financial rewards from credit card programs. Discounts for skin care products can be found in two places. The actual store that is selling the product might have coupons or weekend specials. The manufacturer of the product line might also provide coupons. This is especially true for new products that are just hitting the shelves.
<p> Skin TreatmentsThere are many well-known skin treatments like microdermabrasion, laser treatments and chemical peels that are intended to either increase collagen or grow new skin. These can be very effective but are also incredibly costly. The manufacturers of the devices that are used for these procedures often want to introduce new customers to the treatment. There are various introductory offers that can be used to get large discounts on different types of procedures. The manufacturers frequently offer these discounts directly to any person who is willing to ask for them. Doctors might offer discounts through coupons in local publications.
<p> VitaminsVitamins and A, D and C are all important for healthy skin and collagen production. Some healthy skin vitamins have a premium price attached. It can help to compare credit cards in order to see if retail discounts can be earned through a rewards program that can lower the price. Another reality is that all vitamins are basically the same once extracted. Less expensive generic vitamin mixtures will be just as effective. Searching for different retailers can also help because some stores offer regular discounts or other perks such as loyalty programs that can reduce costs over time.
<p> It is important to look for discounts in the most unlikely places when buying items for skin care. This can include generic offers from an affiliate, cash back from credit cards and bulk purchasing discounts for frequently used products. It can also help to constantly look for items that have the same properties but that on clearance. Aggressively searching for discounts can help to reduce the price of maintaining healthy skin.

<p> What sort of first dates do you like to have? My boyfriend and I's first date (many years ago now!) was coffee at Starbucks. I always think it's a good choice to have a low key first date and just spend time getting to know each other. Save the crazy outings for another date in the future.
<p> 10 tips for a great first date:
<p> 1. Pay
<p> Pay for everything. Don’t mention splitting the bill. If the lady suggests paying part of the bill do not accept the offer. If she insists, allow her to pay what she wishes (this is not just a rule for dating). You will be the best judge at the time whether your date is only insisting because she feels obliged.
<p> 2. Location
<p> No movies on the first date. How can you get to know each other if you spend the majority of the time in silence? I would recommend taking your date out for dinner (no lunch dates on the first date either). Take her somewhere you feel comfortable and somewhere you can easily afford. You don’t want to be nervous all through the date that you might get stuck with a crippling bill. If price is a big concern for you, you can organize your own date in a public place (like a park or even at your own home) and prepare the meal yourself. If you can’t cook, takeaways are fine, but serve it on plates at the table and try to make an effort.
<p> I would also suggest that you not go too overboard with the first date. Keep it simple and moderately priced. You can get extravagent on subsequent dates if things go well.
<p> 3. Manners
<p> First off, if you are going to dinner, read the Rules for Fine Dining list; try to remember at least one or two. When you pick up your date, get out of the car and hold the door open for her. Do the same when you are letting her out of the car. If you are dining out for your first date, hold the chair out for your date and help her sit.
<p> Don’t be late.
<p> 4. Respect
<p> That means not to expect anything in return! A date is not payment for future pleasures, it is a way to get to know someone to gauge compatibility. This rule also means you should not try to get your date drunk, drugged, or compromised in any other way. At the end of the date you can offer a small kiss – offer nothing else and expecting nothing back.
<p> 5. Confidence
<p> Be confident and take charge of the evening. This does not mean you should drag your date around by the arm; be firm with your suggestions and be confident that you will have a good date and make a good impression – remember, if you were a total loser you wouldn’t be on the date in the first place.
<p> 6. Grooming
<p> Dress appropriately for your date, and you should probably let your date know where you are planning to take her in advance so she can also dress appropriately. If you are going to the beach for a seaside dinner, dress nicely (no jeans) but don’t overdress. Similarly, if you are going to a fancy restaurant, wear a shirt and tie. Make sure your shoes are clean and polished if necessary.
<p> Shower. Shampoo. Shave. If you have cologne, wear a little but not too much.
<p> 7. Conversation
<p> Do not focus on yourself during the evening – ask your date questions about herself (this works in all social situations). Listen to the replies too and don’t just look for an opening to start discussing yourself. Do not talk about your job for more than a few minutes – while our own work is a fascinating subject for us, it is seldom fascinating for someone else. Be sure to compliment your date – but don’t go overboard – you will seem desperate.
<p> Do not ever talk about dates you have had with other people or your ex-girlfriends.
<p> 8. Timing
<p> Don’t let your date last too long. Think of it like a good meal – you should finish your plate feeling like you want just a little more. This is the best time to finish a date. This also means that you should not plan for the date to be too far from home otherwise the travel can ruin things.
<p> 9. Gifts
<p> It can be a very nice idea to give your date a small gift on the first date. Don’t go crazy on something expensive – just a nice little token like a single rose is fine. Keep in mind where you are going and how you plan to get there so your date does not end up being lumbered with something that she has to carry around all night. Oh – and don’t pick the rose from your dates garden – buy one.
<p> 10. Conclusion
<p> If you enjoyed your time with your date and would like to see her/him again, call them and tell them so. Don’t wait too long (and definitely don’t play hard to get). Be completely honest. Having said that, if you had an awful time, you should still be honest (though not brutal). There is no point in leading someone on – it will end up badly for both of you.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a $25 gift certificate to over 18,000 restaurants of their choice. (Maybe you can even use this on your first date!)
