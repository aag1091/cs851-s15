<p> Do you remember when you were allowed a quarter to get a gumball out of the machine when you were a child? I know I do. That chewy, sweet and flavorful gum was always desired when at the grocery store or drug store. I used to love the gumball machines that lit up or had a spiral inside. It's time to delight your inner child with the joys of yesterday!
<p> Gumballs.com was created so that everyone could have access to the same high quality, low cost gumball machine and vending supplies that helped them grow to the size they are today. Many different types of exciting gumball and candy machines are offered for sale on the website. Imagine the excitement your child will have when you present them with a gumball machine as a Christmas or birthday present! They will absolutely love it. It would also be equally as great when used at a birthday party.
<p> I was sent a Junior Carousel Machine Gift Set. The machine came with two lbs of gumballs, enough to fill the machine up twice. I enjoyed looking at all of the beautiful colors of the gumballs. What I liked best about the machine was that it had that old time, vintage-y feel that I enjoy. The machine looked like it was straight out of a 1920's candy shop!
<p> The machine is quality crafted and built to last. The combination of the vibrant red and bold silver together is classic and aesthetically pleasing. The Junior Carousel is a smaller version of the classic gumball machine that set the standard for bubble gum machines when they were first introduced in the 1920's - almost 90 years ago! The machine comes put together. It was easy to fill and in no time the glass globe was filled with every color variety of gumballs. I knew I had to try one immediately!
<p> The machine dispenses gumballs with any coin, but can be easily set to work without money. I set it to work without coins and enjoyed a blue gumball that tasted just like I remembered! The gumball came out with ease and did not get stuck inside, and I had no issues twisting the knob either. A great feature of the machine is that you can also use it as a bank. This would be a wonderful opportunity to teach your child about saving money. Have them save their coins inside the bank and be rewarded with a gumball! The coins can be retrieved when the machine is full.
<p> Once the machine is empty, you can fill it with nuts, or any other small candy. Use it to serve some sweet treats at your next party!
<p> The Junior Carousel would be a perfect prsent for an elderly relative to remember the candy shops of their youth. The memories they will revisit will certainly be fun for them!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Junior Carousel Gumball Machine Gift Set from Gumballs.com
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me which color gumball is your favorite. (1 entry)

<p> I'm very particular when it comes to my clothes. I prefer them to look their best and be 100% free of stains at all times. I've tried my fair share of stain removal products, some work and some don't. I'm always on the hunt for that newest stain removal product that provides fantastic results.
<p> America’s dirtiest jobs have to get clean. My Dirty Jobs, LLC has found a way to make it happen with a brand new line of household cleaning products that get America squeaky clean. Inspired by his own show, Dirty Jobs on the Discovery Channel, Mike Rowe became involved with MyDirty Jobs, LLC because of the effectiveness of the products. The creators were open to a new way of marketing the products that appealed to him; they didn’t demonize dirt. The real message is whether it’s as a result of work or play, it’s okay to get dirty. After all, it washes off.
<p> Dirty Jobs Heavy Duty Complete, has a higher concentration of oxygen powered enzymes that is tough on stains, but gentle on fabrics and surfaces than any other stain remover on the market. This makes them perfect for Spring cleaning! The line contains disinfectant spray, all purpose cleaner, carpet foaming cleaner, bathroom cleaner with bleach and more. Each product is made for a specific purpose to make your cleaning experience easier.
<p> I was sent the oxygen complete heavy duty stain remover.
<p> Dirty Jobs Complete Heavy-Duty, Oxygen-Powered Stain Remover can be used as a booster for stain removal in the laundry, a cleaner for dingy bathroom surfaces, for freshening upholstery and fabrics, and it is even safe as a carpet stain remover. The original formula of Dirty Jobs Complete harnesses a higher concentration of oxygen-powered enzymes unlike any other product on the market cutting through grime, grease, stuck-on dirt and set-in stains.
<p> One of the great things about this product is that it's so versatile. I love when items have multiple uses. I accidently got a watermelon stain on a white shirt the other day. The stain remover came at the perfect time to try it out on my shirt. You can use the product in any washer. I used a small amount of the remover in the laundry. It didn't have a harsh smell at all, it was virtually unscented. The remover did a fantastic job of getting the stain out and it was 100% gone when I took it out of the wash. Some stain removers leave a light layer of the stain behind or don't even get it out at all. I wasn't sure how the product would work when I first used it, so I was pleasantly surprised. The size of the tub is perfect for storing in a laundry room or garage for easy access.
<p> I wanted to try the stain remover on something else besides clothing. The faucet in my shower never seems to stay as shiny as I'd like it to, no matter what I do. I took a sponge and put the stain remover to work in the shower. I scrubbed my little heart out and moments later the faucet was shiny and looked brand new! It still looks very nice and clean two days later. I was impressed.
<p> This product is something I'd certainly like to keep around for various jobs around my house. I love how versatile it is! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a wonderful stain remover.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Dirty Jobs Complete Heavy-Duty, Oxygen-Powered Stain Remover.
<p> Winner will be chosen on April 17, 2012 at 10 pm and then will be emailed. One entry per day.Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours. Thank you and good luck!

<p> There's nothing quite like a relaxing and refreshing shower. Can't you just picture standing under the hot, soothing water that melts all of your stresses away? A big part of what makes the shower enjoyable is the showerhead. You need a showerhead that has many settings to make your shower experience the best it can be. If you haven't already upgraded your showerhead recently, it's time to indulge!
<p> LevAqua showerheads take showering to the next level of luxury. They sell a range of digital showerheads either fixed or handheld that take offer pampering at the touch of a button! Whether you'd like a full body surround spray or a pulsating massage, LevAqua has you covered. Your shower experience is their top priority.
<p> I had never heard of a digital showerhead before and the thought of it was really intriguing. When I was able to review the LevAqua 220 OneTouch™ Fixed Digital Showerhead, I was really excited! About a year ago I switched out the boring showerhead that was in my shower when I moved into my apartment. I knew I wanted something with more personality, so I found one with some settings. The showerhead was just okay, nothing special.
<p> The LevAqua showerhead was extremely easy to install. The hardest part was taking the old head out. Within minutes, the new showerhead was installed and I was marveling its chrome beauty. The showerhead has ten fantastic settings such as pulsating massage, full body surround spray, massage and full body surround combo and more. The most unique feature is the fact that you can pause the water while you shave your legs, or wash your hair or body. This eco-friendly setting is perfect for saving 20% of water. There's also a timer so you can time your showers, or time it for your children so they don't take too long of a shower.
<p> Not only is the showerhead aesthetically pleasing to look at, I love how wide it is too. The digital touch controls are easy to operate and you can choose which setting you like each time you take a shower. My favorite setting is the pulsating massage. I love to stand underneath the water and let the water hit my back and shoulders, it's very relaxing and gets all of my tension out.
<p> Each time I take a shower it's such an enjoyable spa experience. Now that I have this showerhead, my shower experience has been completely revolutionized.
<p> If you're tired of your same old same old shower routine, it's time to switch it up! Why not bring the spa to your shower and introduce LevAqua into your home?
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Levaqua® 220 OneTouch™ Fixed Digital Showerhead.

<p> I would say I'm a pretty girly girl. I wear makeup and do my hair daily, and you'll probably never see me without nailpolish on. I dislike the look of bare nails. I feel that bare nails are just asking to be polished with beautiful colors. Doing my nails always cheers me up and the pretty colors boost my mood. Although I prefer getting my nails done then doing them myself, but who doesn't?
<p> Mark offers you beauty and fashion all in one glamorous site. Tons of makeup and skincare products are available for purchase here. If you're looking for a new sprintime body lotion or shower gel, Mark is your go-to place. The scents of the skincare products are always delicious and make you want to eat them, but please don't. :) You can even start up your own Mark business and make some extra cash on the side.
<p> I have a ton of nailpolish in my bathroom, but that doesn't stop me from wanting more. Just like my hair color which changes all of the time, I always want to try a new color on my hands or feet.
<p> I was sent two beautiful Mark nailed it mini nail lacquers in unique colors, Violet Daze and Tickled Pink.
<p> I usually wear mostly reds or pink hues on my nails during the winter, so these bold colors are perfect for spring and summer.
<p> After I admired the colors for a few moments, I decided I wanted to see them on my nails, rather than just in the bottle. I decided on the Violet Daze for my toes first. The color is really nice, it's loud and full of personality. It easily applied to my toes and was not too thick or too thin. The first coat dried pretty quickly and in no time the second coat was dry too. It looked great on my toes and the color instantly reminded me of summer; sitting on the beach with a great frozen drink. Summer is not too far off and neither are my beach dreams!
<p> The Tickled Pink is really adorable. I think the gorgeous pop of pink is perfect for my nails. The polish is sort of iridescent, in my opinion. With a few quick swipes, my nails were brought to life with the essence of pink! The nailpolish easily applied and dried quickly. When I wear pink, I'm used to bright pink or muted pinks, I've never had a nail polish like this one before and I really welcomed the change. I loved the way it looked on my hands.
<p> The great thing about both of these nailpolishes is that they are very small. The adorable mini size can easily be packed in your suitcase or even put in your purse for quick touch-ups on the go. With Mark, beauty will never be far behind.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Mark for providing me with these complimentary nail polishes in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> In a small saucepan stir together the crushed pineapple, brown sugar and dry mustard. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.
<p> Insert the spit rods evenly through the ham and brush with some of the pineapple mixture. After 45 minutes of rotating, brush with pineapple mixture again. Rotate an additional 10 or 15 minutes, or until the ham reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees. Serve sliced ham with some of the pineapple mixture on top.
<p> Combine the garlic, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, rosemary, ginger and olive oil in a small bowl. Add lamb and turn to coat with marinade. Cover and chill at least 6 hours or up to 1 day turning meat over several times.
<p> Rotate the lamb on the spit rods for 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 135 to 140 degrees for medium on the thermometer, basting several times during the last 10 minutes. Untie, slice and serve!
<p> Both of these recipes sound mouth-wateringly good. Please let me know if you plan on making them!

<p> I've had a love affair with infomercials for a long time. I even did my college senior thesis on infomercials. The catchy jingles, the fun items, and the creative way the commercial is designed is fantastic. The products featured are always something you don't realize that you need until you see them advertised. They are usually designed to make your life easier. You can bet that I want quite a few of the products I see on TV!
<p> Sticky Buddy is the super sticky lint roller that has the power of glue without the goo! Use it to remove cat hair, dog hair, crumbs, cat litter and much more! The Sticky Buddy is safe on all types of fabrics and can be used to clean your clothing, comforters, furniture and even the upholstery in your car. It even has little rubber fingers to reach deep into carpets to remove ground in messes. And the best part is that the Sticky Buddy is reusable! Simply clean it with soap and water and let it air dry. In no time, your Sticky Buddy is sticky again!
<p> When I was allowed to review the Sticky Buddy, I was very much looking forward to it. I had seen the infomercial on TV and knew this product was something I would want to try. I received a full sized Sticky Buddy and a travel sized one too.
<p> I know you're probably thinking, "How is this different from a lint roller?" It's a lot different because a lint roller is not reusable. Eventually you'll use all of the tape and have to buy a new one. With the Sticky Buddy, you'll have a roller for life and you'll only have to pay for it once.
<p> The Sticky Buddy is easy to use for the first time. Simply take the product out of its case and remove the tape. After that you're good to and can use the sticky buddy to remove anything unwanted in your home. The upholestry on my dining room chairs gathers a lot of hair and lint. I took the Sticky Buddy for a whirl on the chairs to see what the results would be. You can easily roll the tool up and down your chairs and hair and dust is easily collected. Sticky Buddy collected a lot within the first few rolls and in no time my chairs were lint free and looking fabulous. No sticky residue is left behind at all. When you're done, simply rinse it and dry it and it's sticky again in moments! The water really does get all of the grime off. Sticky Buddy can easily be stored in its case in a cabinet or drawer for handy access.
<p> If you have dogs or cats this would be wonderful for maintaining your peace and sanity with furniture. Use Sticky Buddy to collect dog or cat hair from furniture and carpets. The helpful little fingers will dig up ground in pet hair in no time. Just use short strokes to make sure you retreive all of the hair.
<p> What I like best about the travel sized Sticky Buddy is that you can keep it on your car or your purse. Use it for a quick touch-up on your clothes right before going into a job interview to make sure you look your best. It's also great for picking up crumbs from your children on car seats or car floors. Just let the little fingers do all of the hard work for you!
<p> The uses for Sticky Buddy are endless, but it's something that I recommend that everyone have in their home.

<p> Since everyone loved the Florida Grapefruit giveaway I had last year, it's back by popular demand! Grapefruits are not only delicious, they have many health benefits too. I eat grapefruits several times a week for breakfast to revv up my metabolism for the day. If you haven't tried grapefruit before, I urge you to add it to your list of favorite fruits.
<p> Florida Grapefruit has a rich history, dating back to 1823, when Count Odet Phillippe planted the state’s first grapefruit grove near Tampa. Before that, the first documented grapefruit tree was found in Barbados in the 1700’s.
<p> If you’ve ever wondered why citrus fruits grow in groves, while other fruits grow in orchards or plantations, the answer is simple. Groves are used to describe areas that grow and cultivate tropical fruits. Citrus fruits thrive in Florida’s subtropical climate.
<p> The fruit earned its unusual name because of the way it grows on citrus trees. Take a walk down a grapefruit grove and you’ll see the fruit grows in a cluster like a bunch of oversized grapes. (Taken from website.)
<p> Healthy benefits of grapefruit:
<p> o Grapefruit and 100 percent grapefruit juice contain the antioxidant vitamin C, which may help the body neutralize free radicals that many scientists think may contribute to cell and tissue damage and lead to certain chronic diseases after long-term exposure. One medium Florida grapefruit also contains 4 grams of filling fiber, so it’s a great diet staple.
<p> o Beauty Benefit: Grapefruit’s vitamin C also supports collagen production to help skin maintain elasticity for a youthful, glowing complexion. Collagen breakdown may contribute to the appearance of wrinkles.
<p> o Ways to consume: Grapefruit and its juice can be consumed by themselves, or add segments to cereal, yogurt, salad, salsas and more. Grapefruit juice makes a great addition to marinades, smoothies, and salad dressings.
<p> If you're looking for a way to kick nutrition into high gear, I have just the plan for you. The Grapefruit Active Lifestyle Meal Plan, was created in partnership by Florida Grapefruit and nationally-recognized dietitian and author, Dawn Jackson Blatner, RD. Unlike popular diets of the past, this sweet (and sassy!) plan is filled with crave-worthy meal and snack options to help women meet their weight goals AND fuel an active lifestyle (whether training for a marathon, or keeping up with regular gym visits). Based on their recent consumer survey, nearly 70 percent of women are unsure how many calories to consume in order to maintain or lose weight when active in a fitness regimen.
<p> Kicking old, restrictive diets to the curb, the fresh meal plan features grapefruit as the centerpiece and offers three balanced meals and two sensible snacks each day, like:
<p> These nutrition plans are healthy and full of the protein and nutrients that you need. You'll feel satisfied, healthy, and ready to tackle the day.
<p> To help you get back on a healthy exercise and nutrition routine, Florida Grapefruit has the perfect kit to assist.
<p> Five winners will each win a Florida totebag with a water bottle, pedometer and resistance bands inside. If you've been looking for a way to get back on track with fitness, this kit is perfect for you.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking FIVE (5) winners for this contest. Five winners will win a Florida Grapefruit fitness prize pack.

<p> I make it a daily habit to make smart food choices and eat as healthy as possible. I always buy whole grain breads and flour. Even if I have pasta which isn't as healthy, I buy spinach, vegetable, or whole wheat. I've recently been introduced to quinoa and I love it! There's nothing like a delicious whole grain included into food favorites.
<p> Quinoa Cuisine, written by Jessica Harlan and Kelley Sparwasser has 150 creative recipes for super-nutritious, amazingly delicious dishes. Quinoa is the “pseudograin” related to beets, spinach and chard. Why? It’s not only the best substitute for grains; it’s also a superfood – rich in protein, calcium, iron, fiber, potassium, B vitamins and Vitamin E. It's easily available at Whole Foods or any health-food store.
<p> Quinoa Cuisine includes helpful icons identifying vegetarian, gluten-free and kid-friendly options. It also gives easy ways to incorporate fresh seasonal ingredients into the dishes. Using white, red and black quinoa, as well as quinoa flour and flakes, this book is the ultimate guide to enjoying tasty dishes packed with more protein, amino acids and nutrients.
<p> I've really enjoyed flipping through the books and admiring all of the fantastic sounding recipes. The only thing I wish the book had was pictures of each recipe. I love to see the completed product. I've made two recipes so far from the book. The first dish I made was hummus. The hummus was very easy to make and came out delicious. The recipe called for 1/2 cup quinoa flakes. The steps were easy to follow and understand. For this recipe, you had to cover the quinoa flakes with vegetable stock or broth. You then let them sit for 2 minutes until the flakes are softened. You're never supposed to use "raw" quinoa in a recipe. I followed the rest of the steps and in minutes had smooth and creamy hummus with a wonderful flavor. I enjoyed the hummus atop pita bread and it was a delicious and healthy midday snack!
<p> I was craving something sweet for the next recipe, so I decided to indulge in was funnel cake bites. I've always loved the funnel cakes at the fair, so why not bring the fair to my kitchen? The recipe called for quinoa flakes and flour this time. The recipe seemed a little challenging and harder than I was used to, but I wanted to challenge myself with the new recipe. I carefully followed the recipe and soon after I had delicious funnel cake bites that were waiting to be dusted with sugar. After dusting those delicious nuggets of heaven, they immediately met their match with my stomach. They were fantastic and just the sweet treat that my taste buds were craving!
<p> This book is filled with wonderful appetizers, entrees, salads and desserts that would be perfect for your next party. If you live a gluten free lifestyle, these exciting and delicious recipes would give your mouth an awesome boost of flavor! Just remember that not each recipe is gluten free, but a lot are. There's definitely a recipe in here suited for anyone's taste. Why not make some of the recipes today?
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a copy of Quinoa Cuisine by Jessica Harlan and Kelley Sparwasser.

<p> I have a few pieces of Rachael's cookware, but I've recently been wanting to add to my collection. When I had the chance to review the new gradient bubble and brown set, I was very excited! The set comes in a range of colors like blue, yellow, orange and more, that will surely add some personality to any kitchen.
<p> I was sent three pieces, one small, medium and large. The red is gorgeous and looks fantastic with my stainless steel and black appliances in my kitchen.
<p> How beautiful is this set? I couldn't be any happier with it! I don't have a lot of colored cookware and this definitely adds a nice pop of color. The red is really vibrant and full of life. I really love the modern design of the set and it is high quality ceramic. It's not heavy to lift. The pieces stack inside of each other and can be easily stored in a cabinet or pantry for easy access. The set is dishwasher, oven and microwave safe which I love. What I like most about the set is that it's very versatile. Not only can you cook food in it, but you can serve and store food in it too.
<p> I used the smaller piece for heating up some brownies for dessert tonight. If you have some friends over, the small dish would be great for serving some treats in. I heated up the brownies in the microwave and they heated evenly in the dish and were nice and warm after.
<p> I used the medioum sized dish for storing fruit in. I'm actually going to keep it on my counter for easy access to a healthy snack. Three apples and two bananas can be stored conveniently in this dish.
<p> I plan on making a baked ziti in the largest dish tomorrow night. I can't wait to cook and it I know it will cook up beautifully! There are so many different uses for each sized dish that the possibilities are endless. Why not cook a roast and veggies in the largest dish, macaroni and cheese in the medium sized dish, and roasted sliced carrots in the smaller dish? The bubble and brown set will bring so much added fun to your table. It would be a fantastic idea to cook your Easter dinner in this set.
<p> The bubble and brown set is a much welcomed addition to my kitchen and I highly recommend it. The set would be a great housewarming present or even a wonderful bridal shower gift too.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to QVC for providing me with the complimentary bubble and brown set in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> This is post #6 for Kiddie Academy. I had never thought about opening a franchise, but this is something that is working well for people, especially Bill and Marina!
<p> Bill and Marina Schmidt opened their Kiddie Academy franchise on March 31, 2008 at 4225 Concept Court, Bradenton, Florida, while in their mid-40's. The Schmidts have a passion for the business and believe whole-heartedly in “Community Begins Here.” With their dedication to superior customer service, commitment to education and focus on creating a warm, nurturing environment, the Schmidts have shown local families why Kiddie Academy stands apart from their competitors.
<p> Background: With the birth of their daughter, Bill and Marina began looking for quality child care in their area, which turned out to be quite a challenge. As a Vice President of Human Resources for a Fortune 500 company, with a Master’s degree in early childhood education, Marina became dissatisfied with the corporate world and saw this as an opportunity to use her skills in an educational aspect. For Bill, a manufacturing engineer, opening a Kiddie Academy location meant bringing a much needed service to the area. The Schmidts were looking at child care franchise options for a little over a year before they decided upon Kiddie Academy. They found Kiddie Academy’s dedication to education and warm, welcoming approach to be the perfect combination.
<p> Goals: Coming from the human resources field, having excellent customer service has always been a goal for Marina. Developing a staff that can provide the level of service the families deserve is important. They host new hire orientations, service trainings and monthly staff meetings, which include role playing. Both Marina and Bill continue to look for ways to go above and beyond for the families they serve, including help with resumes or locating jobs in the area.
<p> Challenges: Like many new business owners, the Schmidts faced challenges. At the time of their opening, the economic market conditions were the worst in many years. Homes throughout Florida and the rest of the country were being foreclosed on and unemployment rates were at an all-time high. Nevertheless, the Schmidts persevered -- benefiting from an abundant work force, the fact that many previous stay-at-home moms were re-entering the workforce, and a supportive franchisor with a proven business model. Despite those issues, the Schmidts have become extremely successful.
<p> Results: The couple’s passion and attention to customer service and community outreach has earned them a stellar reputation in the area, along with tremendous community and parent support. They have received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback that has complimented their passion, service and programs. The Schmidts focus on grassroots marketing and initiatives, including events such as book readings, parent date nights and local partnerships have helped them achieve the success they are enjoying today.
<p> *DISCLOSURE*I have a 3 month relationship with Kiddie Academy for which I am being compensated for. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine, and not based on anything else.
