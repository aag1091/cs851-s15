<p> I don't have severe acne, but I have enough pimples that it bothers me and I want to do something about it. I've heard about Proactiv for years and have always wanted to try it, but never had the opportunity until now. Proactive was nice enough to send me their complete travel sized kit. The kit comes with Renewing CleanserRevitalizing TonerRepairing LotionRefining Mask
<p> The first time I used Proactiv I instantly felt my skin become much smoother. I really like the renewing cleanser because it has sort of "microscrubbers" in it which exfoliate. I haven't been using the Proactiv system long enough to really see any true results yet, but I am sure I will soon! Proactiv is actually better than ever with it's newest version. As the website says: "New Proactiv contains our exclusive micro-crystal benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in Step 1: Renewing Cleanser and Step 3: Repairing Treatment. This new BPO is refined to be small enough to gently slide into pores and clear acne. The New micro-crystals are designed to penetrate the pores fast and start killing acne on contact. It works within the skin, not just on the surface. With the addition of the micro-crystal benzoyl peroxide, New Proactiv is simply gentler and faster acting."
<p> I love cutesy shirts with funny sayings or pictures. When I found out I could do a review/giveaway with Boredinc.net, I was excited.

I recently was in Florida and had it sent to my parents so it was there when I came. I took it the beach and it was great! First of all, it was very easy to blow up.
