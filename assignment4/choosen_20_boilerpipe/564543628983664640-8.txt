<p> I'm not a gigantic soda drinker, but I do enjoy a glass or two every once in a while of it. The brand of soda that I drink the least is Mountain Dew. I am not saying that I dislike it, but I just prefer Sprite or Diet Coke. I recently learned that Mountain Dew has come out with some new flavors that sound interesting, and I wanted to try them.
<p> PepsiCo is a Fortune 500, American global corporation headquartered in Purchase, Harrison, New York, with interests in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay, Inc. PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi to a broader range of food and beverage brands, the largest of which include an acquisition of Tropicana in 1998 and a merger with Quaker Oats in 2001 - which added the Gatorade brand to its portfolio as well.
<p> You're familiar with such PepsiCo snacks as Lay's potato chips, Quaker brand foods and snacks, Fritos corn chips, Lipton teas and more. I was not aware of all the brands that PepsiCo produces until I did some research! :)
<p> I was sent some samples of new Mountain Dew flavors to try. I received Mountain Dew Pitch Black, Mountain Dew Supernova, and Mountain Dew Typhoon.
<p> The first thing I noticed about these soft drinks was the huge sugar content they pack. I think one flavor had 77 grams of sugar. I was shocked and also a bit nervous to drink it because that is an insane amount of sugar, so I just had a few sips of each. I also noticed these flavors were not heavily carbonated either. I loved the colors of the soft drinks though.
<p> My favorite was Supernova. It is a magenta colored strawberry-melon flavored Dew with ginseng. The color was a pretty peach. The flavor was very refreshing and fruity and would be great on a hot summer day. The carbonation level was subtle but the flavor os the strawberry melon was very prevalent. I had never tasted a soda similiar to this before. I was intrigued.
<p> Pitch black was grape flavored. I did not enjoy this flavor at all. The grape flavor was strong and very powerful. I am not a fan of grape. I did like the dark purple color though.
<p> The typhoon was a a red-orange strawberry-pineapple flavored Dew. I liked this one a lot too. The flavor was crisp and refreshing and very delicious. Strawberry and pineapple go perfect together and are such a classic combination. I would love to use this in a punch for a party. I think everyone would love it.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking SIX (6) winners for this contest. Six winners will win a coupon for a free 12 pack of bottles or cans of any flavor of Pepsi-Cola carbonated soft drinks.

<p> I put my hair up frequently. I like to get it out of my face. I'm pretty unoriginal with how I put it up though. I either do it in a messy bun sort of style or just a ponytail. Pretty boring right? I'm always looking for new ways to wear my hair and Whirl-A-Style has taken my request and made it a reality!
<p> Lois Sonstegard is internationally respected as ‘THE Upstyle Hair Design Resource’. Whirl-a-Style hair accessories are also internationally recognized as the leading upstyle and hair styling design accessories in the world, with successful sales across many professional and fashion retail categories, including the salon, spa, dance, cheerleader, bridal, military, and general retail markets. Whirl-A-Style consists of three different, yet related hairstyling products: Whirl-a-Style, Klicinz and Poppi.
<p> Whirl-A-Style is a simple to use hair styling tool designed for the woman on the go! This easy to use hair styling tool allows you to pull your hair back into a twist or bun without the need for clips or hair ties. It also has a special slit so it provides less strain and pull on the hair itself for less breakage. The Whirl-A-Style comes in 5 sizes and 12 colors.
<p> I was sent a brown Whirl-A-Style for review purposes. I think this product is great for women, especially moms on the go who don't have time to really do their hair. This tool will allow them to still have a fun and trendy hair style, but in a much quicker way.
<p> The hair styling tool matches my hair perfectly which is good because it blends in well. I was sent instructions and an instructional DVD with my styling tool. I've used products like this before so I figured I could easily get the hang of it. It's not as simple as I remember and it did take some practice and getting used to before I could securely have it in my hair. I have longer hair so it takes some practice when you use the tool before you get it 100% right. I like that there's so many different hair styles you can achieve by using this. I slid my hair through the slit and followed the instructions which told me to roll it up. I rolled it up and snapped it into a funky bun updo. I really like it because you can achieve elegant updo's that look like you spent hours in a salon getting it done, but for a fraction of the cost!
<p> An informational video showing how to create a bun with the Whirl-A-Style.
<p> The tool is easy to use once you get the hang of it, and it's fun to create many different styles. The tool stays securely in your hair and is not uncomfortable to wear in any way, and it doesn't weigh on your head either.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Whirl-A-Style hair tool.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me what kind of updo you would like to achieve with the Whirl-A-Style. (1 entry)

<p> There's nothing in this world that I love more than chocolate. I am not too much of a plain chocolate lover, oh no. My chocolate has to be busy. Even when I make brownies I throw in M&amp;M's, and pretzel bits, etc. I love chocolate that is bold and has lots of personality. Suzi's Sweet Shoppe shares my philosophy on chocolate and for that she is a smart woman.
<p> Suzi's Sweet Shoppe knows that creating premium chocolate is an art that requires great skill, passion and dedication. Nobody knows that better than the owners of Suzi’s Sweet Shoppe, Susan and Stan Hordych. Since opening their doors in 1998, they’ve developed and refined their unique hand-dipped chocolates and candy with absolute devotion. It’s evident in every tongue-tingling sweet they produce.
<p> Much care and attention goes into each and every confection. Staying true to time-honored recipes and old-world craftsmanship, they use only the highest quality and freshest ingredients in all their sweets. Preparation is carefully monitored, from mixing and cooking the ingredients, to measuring and cutting the pieces.
<p> The sweet treats at Suzi's are mouth-wateringly delicious. When you walk into the shop, you're basically walking into chocolate heaven. Whether you desire fudge, chocolate covered pretzels, truffles, gift sets, sugar free specialities and more, they have you covered. Any kind of chocolate your sugar laden heart desires, Suzi's carries.
<p> I received a package from Suzi and it was filled with chocolate-y goodness. As I took each item out of the package my sweet tooth emerged more and more. I received a chocolate treat in the shape of an old fashioned top hat. The treat was made out of milk chocolate and had oreo cookie and marshmallow inside. I received a very large S'Mores, and a huge box of chocolate covered pretzels. Each pretzel was different and contained sprinkles, M&amp;M's, and more! Lastly I received a large chocolate covered Twinkie with white chocolate drizzle. Oh My! Suzi really knew the key to my heart and she's turned that key quite well! :) I'm sorry that I don't have a picture of the S'Mores. I forgot to take a picture of it before I had a few bites.
<p> So far I've only tried a few bites of the S'mores and the pretzels. The S'mores was gigantic! It was a huge chocolate covered marshmallow packin' graham cracker extravaganza. I had never seen anything like it before. It was so big that I could barely take a bite, I had to break off a piece! The only thing that I regret not doing is heating it up in the microwave, like a true S'more. I had it unheated and it was still delicious though. Upon first bite you are hit with a wave of flavors all at once. It is so delightful. You taste the sweet milk chocolate covering the crunchy and flakey graham cracker walls. Then, following that, you taste the fluffy, sweet marshmallow. Your taste buds are in chocolate nirvana and there's no stopping them! A S'mores is the perfect treat for any age. There's just something so comforting and fabulous about the combination of marshmallow, graham crackers, and chocolate. It's a magical trifecta of deliciousness.
<p> I had a chocolate covered M&amp;M pretzel next. Each pretzel is so pretty I had a hard time eating it! The pretzel is a very decent size. You're not eating some dinky little pretzel, mind you. This pretzel is large and in charge and packs some serious flavor. It's so visually pleasing too with the perfect chocolate color and the multi-colored M&amp;M's. Upon first bite, you taste the milk chocolate and the crunchy, salty combination of the pretzel all at once. It's the perfect combination and the flavors swirl together and your senses are in chocolate pretzel bliss! The M&amp;M's are crunchy and add an even sweeter twist to an already perfect treat. You can't get any better than this. It's the perfect afternoon treat too. Just pair it with a glass of milk and let the chocolate melt away all of your troubles.
<p> I haven't tried the rest of Suzi's sweets yet, but I can guarantee you that they are absolutely fabulous. I highly recommend that you try some of Suzi's sweets in the near future. :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 1 lb box of chocolate covered pretzels and a $25 gift card.
<p> Winner will be chosen on July 3, 2011 at 10 pm and then will be emailed.One entry per day.Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours.

<p> I love experimenting with different flavors for coffee. Coffee is fabulous but sometimes it needs to be spiced up. Cinnamon hazelnut coffee with a hint of brown sugar? Delicious. How about Vanilla Chai coffee with cinnamon sprinkled in it? Even better. When I discovered Bailey's Creamers, I was in love. It was the answer to my flavored coffee obsession.
<p> People have loved the silky, creamy richness and renowned flavor of Baileys Original Irish Cream since it was created over 30 years ago. So we thought (and soon found out we were not alone), wouldn't it be great if people could enjoy the rich flavor Baileys is known for in their coffee anytime they want? So we came up with Bailey's Coffee Creamers— delicious, non-alcoholic flavored coffee creamers, with all the quality and great taste for which Baileys is known.
<p> I went to the store tonight after work and chose the French vanilla creamer. I had a cup of decaf coffee when I got home from the store and couldn't wait to try the new liquid deliciousness in my mug. The bottle is very stylish. It's black and features a flower on the top to represent French vanilla. The bottom has a golden brown swirl design on it, which reminds me of coffee.
<p> The container was easy to open and poured smoothly into my mug. I could smell the creamer as I poured it and it smelled fantastic! I was just drinking plain coffee on purpose as I didn't want a flavored coffee to interfere with the taste of the creamer. I took a sip and it was wonderful. The warm coffee revived me after a long day and the taste of French vanilla was extremely prevalent. The creamer was not especially overwhelming but provided just enough of a vanilla flavor. It was delicious! It really gave my coffee personality and pizazz and I enjoyed it immensely. This was the best cup of coffee I've had in quite a long time. I am not sure I can drink my coffee without this wonderful addition now! I am looking forward to trying the other flavors from Baileys, I am sure they will be equally as great!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TWO (2) winners for this contest. Two winners will win three free product coupons each to purchase Bailey's Creamers with.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me which flavor of Bailey's Creamers you would like to try. (1 entry)

<p> Now that hot weather is here, I get to wear cute bathing suits to the beach and pool all the time. It's important to me that I look my best in them and have a stylish swim suit, so for that I turned to Voda Swim.
<p> VodaSwim is a division of Voda Fashion LLC based in Los Angeles, California. Voda Swim is an upscale swimwear brand founded by Yulia and her husband Dustin. Yulia has always had a true passion for fashion. When she was a little girl she would make dresses for her dolls, sweaters for her dog, and clothes for herself. Utilizing the highest quality fabrics and comfortable designs in classic solids and beautiful prints, Voda Swim is designed for sexy, confident, and athletic women.
<p> I love the swim suits that Voda Swim offers. They are fun, vibrant and full of personality. I was sent the Essence Envy Push Up® Tankini &amp; adjustable scoop. Who said less is more? The Envy Push Up® Tankini swimsuit top covers all the right areas and falls low enough to cover the mid-section, but still accentuates your sexy side. The Adjustable Scoop swimsuit bottoms can go from demure to daring with the pull of the side ties. Perfect for the woman who wants different swimwear bottoms for different occasions.
<p> End caps are 14K gold plated and are chlorine and salt water resistant Body: nylon/spandex, lining: polyester/spandex Fully lined Top: ties at neck and back Full coverage Made in USA
<p> I really love this bathing suit. In the summer I go to the pool and beach a lot and it's always nice to have a new bathing suit to wear. The print of the swimsuit is really cute and reminds me of paisley. I've even gotten compliments already when I wore it the indoor pool yesterday!
<p> The suit fits me well and is comfortable to wear although I can tell it runs a little bit small, so it might be best to order the next size up if you purchase one through the website. I love the envy push up of the swimsuit as it gives me a little bit more on top and increases your bust size 1 to 2 cups. It looks like a normal bathing suit top and gives you great support, has no sagging or underwires, and features low water absorbency. I've had my fair share of dealing with those annoying padded inserts that would pop out of your bathing suit in the wash or even when you were swimming. They left me with no support and just made my bathing suit top look awkward. It was also hard to get them back in 100% how they should be. I was very happy that this swimsuit was not like all of the other so called "push ups."
<p> The ties on the swimsuit bottom are adjustable, although I didn't change mine at all, I prefer it the way it is. I might eventually adjust it though. I prefer a tankini rather than a bikini because it covers you more. I've washed the suit already once and it has been fine and no issues with bleeding dye or colors occured. I can't wait to wear this suit more this summer!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a swimsuit of their choice from Vodaswim.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> I've been using Nivea products for years and rely on them for their trustworthy ingredients that truly moisturize and hydrate my skin. The Nivea lip balm that I use in the winter gives my lips the hydration that they need, and the face lotion keeps my face moisturized completely. I like that their products are natural and make my skin look great.
<p> Nivea is the world’s largest skin care brand which uses ingredients inspired by nature to work in harmony with skin, body and life to make you look and feel more beautiful. Founded on years of research, NIVEA focuses on the structure and function of the skin searching for new ways to support beautiful, healthy looking skin.
<p> NIVEA introduces a body wash moisture revolution with the debut of breakthrough HYDRA IQ, an exclusive moisturizing technology that works to balance the skin’s moisture level. This nature identical technology supports the skin’s hydration system and the transfer of moisture throughout the skin, resulting in superior hydration.
<p> New NIVEA A Touch of Cashmere Body Wash and A Touch of Serenity Body Wash are developed with HYDRA IQ technology and are enriched with skin-soothing and hydrating ingredients and conditioners. The new floral scents, created in partnership with renowned global fragrance houses, are a refreshing scent-sation and take the shower experience to the next sensorial level. All NIVEA Body Wash formulas gently cleanse the skin, leaving you feeling clean, beautiful and touchably soft. In addition to the two new products, all existing NIVEA Body Washes are formulated with the new HYDRA IQ technology.
<p> I was sent a bottle of Nivea Hydra IQ Cashmere Body Wash for review.
<p> I always use body wash in the shower because it foams up well, leaves your skin smooth and soft, and smells great! This is a cream oil based body wash and has an orchid blossom scent. It also features cashmere proteins. The bottle has a picture of a flower on it which is calming and relaxing. I used it in the shower the other day and I really enjoyed it. It has a great floral scent, lathers up well, and rinses nicely. I loved the way my skin felt after using it, it felt like I had moisturized myself with a lot of lotion, but I didn't! I truly felt that my skin was really hydrated and nourished. I have dry skin so gaining as much nourishment as possible from a product is very important to me. I even noticed hours later that the smoothness remained, which I've never had with any other body wash before. I am very impressed with this product and it will definitely be my new go-to body wash.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking THREE (3) winners for this contest. Three winners will win a set of NIVEA Hydra IQ Cashmere Body Washes.

<p> I'm a huge lover of kitchen appliances. A trip to Williams-Sonoma for me has the same affect that a trip to Bloomingdales has for someone (although I love clothes shopping too.) There's just something enticing and exciting about a shiny new blender or a fast and powerful stand mixer that I can't describe.
<p> Ninja is a house care brand by Euro-Pro that strives to create innovative kitchen products, showcasing design and performance. There are several different Ninja models in the brand. Each appliance juices, blends, chops, mixes, &amp; more, all in one unit! Using a Ninja appliance saves you time, money, and counterspace.
<p> I was sent the Kitchen System 1100 for review purposes.
<p> Experience Ninja's unmatched versatility. Discover how smart-speed technology and our 5-star rated multiple blade system make it easy to juice, blend, chop, and mix just about everything - from frozen drinks and soups to ice cream and pizza dough. It's more than a food processor. It's more than a blender. It's the Ninja Kitchen System.
<p> Ninja Kitchen System Base and 40 oz. Processing Bowl with Blade and Lid
<p> Get the best result every time thanks to easy-to-use controls and a smart design that automatically adjusts the motor speed to the consistency of the ingredients.
<p> 72 oz. Pitcher with Blade and Lid
<p> Use the extra large pitcher for tall orders - whether you have a large family, are a health enthusiast, or like to entertain, you can make all the drinks you need and more!
<p> Whisk Attachment, Dough Hook and Dough Paddle
<p> Make homemade dough, batter, and more - easily! Pizza, biscuits, bread, and desserts at the touch of a button!
<p> This unit is amazing. First of all it is very attractive and I love that it's black and chrome. I have a small kitchen with little counter space, so it's hard for me to store too many appliances in it. I do have a blender, mixer, food chopper, and food processor though. It's annoying to have to lug it out and clean it each time I use it. The Ninja is truly revolutionizing my kitchen space! The unit combines all of those appliances in one, and does so many awesome tasks. It makes my life so much easier.
<p> The Ninja is easy to operate and very user friendly. The different attachments are easily attachable and removable as well. You just press the button for whatever you are making and the Ninja goes to work. Whether you want to pulse, chop ice for drinks (there's a button just for that!) dough, or blend, it does it all with ease.
<p> I used the Ninja two days ago to chop large almonds for baking. With my old chopper I had to press the chop button quite a few times to get the desired consistency, it wasn't an automatic fine chop. The Ninja has very sharp blades and almost instantly finely chopped my almonds. I was very impressed and now plan on getting rid of all of my other appliances and making room for the star of the show!
<p> This morning I made a smoothie for breakfast. I put in bananas, strawberries, a few blueberries, some milk, ice, and yogurt. I gave the Ninja a whirl and mere seconds later my breakfast was ready! The smoothie was cold, creamy, and delicious. There were no fruit chunks or unblended particles at all in the drink. The consistency was perfect and delicious. Since it's hot out, it would be fun to make frozen margaritas or strawberry daquiri's. Since the Ninja has a large 72 oz pitcher, it would be awesome for parties.
<p> The Ninja and blades are dishwasher safe to make your life easier. I would love to use the unit for making cookie or pizza dough in the future. I truly love how versatile this machine is. It does any job that you need extremely well. I never thought that I would own a machine that can make cookies, ice cream, dough, chop veggies, and make a milkshake all in one. It looks great sitting on my counter too. Thanks Ninja for changing the way I cook and bake!

<p> My dog Colby lives for treats, literally. Her whole life revolves around treats and she tries to get as many a day as possible. She's a little piggy but she's my baby so of course I give her what makes her happy :)
<p> Three Dog Bakery makes the best all natural, oven-baked dog treats, pastries, and food. They select premium all natural ingredients and then oven bake them to perfection. They do NOT add chemicals, fillers, or refined sugars-only the best dog food for their companions! It's their way of helping your (and our) pets live a long, healthy, happy, tail-wagging life. In fact, this is why dogs love them!
<p> Colby was sent two bags of treats. She received banana split and strawberry cremes.
<p> Colby went crazy for these treats. I gave her a strawberry creme treat first. They are the perfect size for her because she's a small dog. The treat is a cute pink color and a fun shape. It has real strawberry and cream flavor. She sniffed the treat and wagged her tail, looked at me to make sure it was okay that she eats it, and gobbled it up! She wagged her tail afterwards and licked her lips which signified that she absolutely loved it! She looked at me for another one because she can be slightly greedy.
<p> I gave her the banana split treat the next day. This treat is made with real carrots, peanuts, banana, and cherry flavors. I've never given Colby a treat like this before, so I wasn't sure what she would think. She didn't waste a second trying to see if it was okay if she ate it. The second I put it in her bowl she ate it happily. I liked how these treats were also small and the right size for her. The treats are multi-colored and easily distinguishable by flavor in the bag.
<p> One lucky winner will win a basket of dog treats and items for their furbaby. (Items possibly subject to change upon winner's receipt)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a basket of dog items and treats for their pooch.
<p> Winner will be chosen on June 22, 2011 at 10 pm and then will be emailed.One entry per day.Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours.

<p> When I think of premium ice cream, Haagen-Dazs is the first brand that comes to mind. I associate them with sweet creamy and rich ice cream that is sure to satisfy. Since the warm weather is finally here, why not sit back in a lounge chair poolside enjoying Haagen-Dazs ice cream?
<p> The philosophy of Haagen-Dazs is simple: find the purest and finest ingredients in the world and craft them into the best ice cream, sorbet, and frozen yogurt available. It is a way of doing business that is as demanding as it is uncommon. and it is the reason why the brand has epitomized fine ice cream for nearly half a century. The brand offers super premium ice cream, gelato, sorbet and frozen yogurt. The treats offered from this brand are wonderful. Whether you'd like plain vanilla, chocolate, or even cookie dough ice cream, they have you covered with many other flavors as well. The Haagen-Dazs stores also sell sinfully delicious milkshakes and sundaes too. You'll fall in love with their ice cream as soon as you wrap your lips around the spoon!
<p> So far I have only tried the Vanilla Chocolate ice cream cone. Of course I am a huge chocoholic and the box was calling my name as soon as Fed-Ex dropped off my package! I love that these are small, snack-sized cones because they are not too large to ruin a diet, but just enough of a treat to satisfy that sweet tooth.
<p> Upon first look at the heavenly cone, your eyes are met with such a luscious looking treat. When you take that first bite, your taste buds are presented with sweet and creamy vanilla ice cream that is simply perfect, along with a fabulously crunchy waffle cone. The chocolate sauce on top is rich and combines perfectly with the fabulous vanilla ice cream. The roasted almonds on top are the perfect bonus for adding an awesome crunch to an already delectable treat. The cone is lined with wonderful milk chocolate and when you reach the chocolatey surprise inside, it's the best thing ever. The vanilla and chocolate together is such a fantastic combination. This cone was a little piece of heaven that was beyond amazing.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking FIVE (5) winners for this contest. Five winners will win a free product coupon for Haagen-Dazs snack-sized ice cream cones.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Cookies are so comforting. Whether you're enjoying an oatmeal, chocolate chip, or sugar cookie they instantly wash a sense of calm and happiness over you. You feel so at peace when you're enjoying this delightful treat. Well now the cookies have the same feeling too because Smiley Cookies are literally smiling!
<p> Smiley Cookies started as a half-baked idea more than 20 years ago — a smiley cookie as the vehicle to communicate the ethos of a restaurant — Eat’n Park, the Place for Smiles. Soon our cookie became not just the signifier of a delightful family dining experience, but a symbol of commitment to community and charitable giving, indeed, the mascot of the company. (Who knew a six-foot walking sugar cookie would have such draw. You have to be cracking a smile by now!)
<p> Today, every child that dines at Eat’n Park receives the surprise of a buttery, rich, delicious smiley cookie, totaling more than 1 million free cookie treats each year. Every day, our cookies are distributed to community, charity and fundraising events. Every year, more than 200,000 smiling cookies are donated to local non-profit organizations. That’s a lot to smile about.
<p> What's not to love about a delicious cookie with a contagious smile? Not much else if you ask me!
<p> For the chocholics out there Smiley Cookies also come in a dark or milk chocolate variety. Gift baskets are also available with your choice of Smiley Cookie and item(s).
<p> These cookies would be great as a housewarming present, birthday gift, thinking of you, new baby, get well soon, and anything else you can think of! Anyone who receives these cookies will absolutely love them.
<p> One lucky winner will win a gift basket of Smiley Cookies featuring two dozen Smiley Cookies.

<p> Popcorn is a favorite snack of mine. I love the crunchy exterior that it has along with the aromatic flavor of butter or seasalt. Popcorn can be enjoyed in so many ways, but my favorite way to enjoy this delightful treat is air popped with just a hint of melted butter poured over it. Healthy and delicious!
<p> Weaver Gold is the first microwave popcorn made with olive oil. Our popcorn delivers exceptional taste and better nutrition! The company is based in Indiana and was founded in 1928 by Reverend Ira Weaver. Popcorn has been their only business for more than 80 years. They control the quality every step of the way, from seed to package, and their popcorn is 100% GMO-free. Weaver Popcorn distributes popcorn in more than 90 countries.
<p> I was sent two delicious flavors of Weaver Gold popcorn, movie theater butter and parmesean with Italian herbs and garlic. I had never tried popcorn with olive oil before so I was intrigued by the thought of it. A uniquely fresh and flavorful taste. The perfect balance of Tuscan-inspired flavors with savory parmesan, Italian herbs and a hint of garlic in every bite.
<p> The extraordinary buttery taste you crave with a rich aroma that makes it hard to keep this snack all to yourself.
<p> I first sampled the parmesean with Italian herbs and garlic. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at first because I was worried the garlic flavor would be very strong. That wasn't the case at all. The popcorn smelled heavenly as it was popping in the microwave. I couldn't wait to dig in. As I opened the bag I was hit with the potent flavors of garlic and cheese all at once and it smelled fantastic! Upon first bite, I tasted the crunchy popcorn exterior and my tastebuds were met with a strong burst of parmesean and a hint of garlic flavor that was out of this world! I was in popcorn bliss and loving every minute of it. I noticed a subtle herb flavor which gave the popcorn a nice kick of personality. Each bite of popcorn had an equal balance of flavors and it was truly addicting! I couldn't believe that this was microwavable popcorn, it tasted like high quality gourmet popcorn that you would receive in a tin! It was marvelous and I highly enjoyed it.
<p> Next, I sampled the movie theatre butter style popcorn. I patiently stood by the microwave watching the seconds tick down and waiting for the popcorn to pop. I knew that this snack had a date with my stomach! The popcorn smelled so mouth-wateringly delicious. I tried a few pieces and it was pure bliss. I loved that the movie theatre style popcorn was now in my kitchen. The only thing missing was a 60" screen and a movie playing in my living room! The popcorn was excellently crunchy and had a marvelous butter flavor. This snack is definitely a comfort food. The flavor of the butter was not overwhelming, but just perfect. Each bite was better than the first and I had to stop myself as to not eat the entire bag all at once! It was by far the best microwavable popcorn I've ever had. I highly recommend it.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TWO (2) winners for this contest. Two winners will win both varieties of popcorn that I reviewed.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me which type of popcorn is your favorite. (1 entry)
