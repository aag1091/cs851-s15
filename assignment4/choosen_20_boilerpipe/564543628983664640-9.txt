<p> Pizza is something that I'm a huge fan of. My ultimate pizza would be a deep dish with a blend of four cheeses, pepperoni, and sausage. Mmm, my mouth is watering right now! I'm not extremely adventurous with pizza toppings. I stick to what I like and what tastes good. :)

Whether you're looking for a sausage and cheese pizza, pepperoni and cheese pizza, or many toppings on one pizza, Red Baron is the king of pizza, and they do it right!

<p> I'm a cheese fanatic. A delicious piece of cheese bursting with flavor on a cracker is something that I enjoy often. The little things in life make me happy and why not stop and enjoy life with fabulous cheese?
<p> Mini Babybel is known for its unique packaging which consists of a netted bag in which each piece is encased in red wax. Numerous flavors of Mini Babybel are offered across the world. The original Mini Babybel, a Dutch Edam variety, is encased in red wax. There are currently eight flavors offered in the U.S.: Original, Sharp Original, Light, Bonbel, Cheddar, White Cheddar, Swiss, and Gouda.
<p> I’ve always loved Mini Babybel cheeses. They are perfect for throwing in a lunch or bringing them to work for a quick snack. The cheeses are encased in a unique red wax packaging that is very fun to peel too.
<p> Mini Babybel has two new flavors, Sharp Original, and White Cheddar. They sounded delicious and I knew I had to try them!
<p> (What the cheese looks like inside the wax.)
<p> I sampled the White Cheddar flavor first. As I unwrapped the plastic packaging, I knew that the key to my cheesy heart awaited in the red wax packaging. I slowly peeled away the wax casing and the most delicious circle of creamy White Cheddar cheese greeted me. I had never loved shapes as much as I did in that very second! The cheese was a perfect off white color and smelled fabulous. As I took that first bite, my mouth exploded with white cheddar flavor. The cheese was cold, creamy, fabulous, and just utterly perfect. It was smooth and rich and I savored the fantastic flavor and wished it lasted more than a few mere bites. It was the best piece of cheese I’ve had in a while. The cheese was soft and very smooth and I loved that it was creamy but also very firm too.
<p> I tried the Sharp Cheddar next. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the second round of cheese delight. As I unwrapped the wax packaging that separated me from the contestant who would win a date with my stomach, I knew that it was going to be delicious. The color was perfect and it looked fantastic and smelled even better. I took a bite and I was instantly met with the flavor of Sharp Cheddar perfection. The flavor was sharp but not too sharp, it was the pefect balance of sweet creamy cheese flavor meets heavenly cheddar flavor. I absolutely loved it! The cold creamy cheese treat was the perfect refreshing treat for a hot summer's day.
<p> The cheese is 100% natural and has no artificial additives. Each Mini Babybel cheese has 60 calories which is not bad at all. You could even splurge and have two and it wouldn't ruin your day's calories. Go ahead and treat yourself today! :)

<p> Summer's here! Time to fire up those grills and have a fun BBQ with friends and family.
<p> NSF International is a nonprofit organization that is committed to protecting public health and safety by developing standards and certifying products against those standards – would like to share a list of its top tips for picnic and grilling safety.
<p> NSF would love to share some picnic safety tips with you.
<p> 1) Put perishable foods (i.e. hot dogs, cut fruits and salads) in individual containers on the bottom of the cooler with ice packs on the top:
<p> This method provides the best insulation for foods that need to remain cool and helps prevent cross contamination. Transport uncooked meats in a separate cooler from ready-to-eat foods
<p> 2) Put cold drinks (i.e. sodas, juices, etc.) in a separate cooler:
<p> This method avoids having the cooler containing perishable foods being constantly opened and closed.
<p> 3) Carry the cooler in the passenger area of the car:
<p> Keeping the cooler in the passenger area instead of in the trunk allows the air conditioning to help keep the contents cool.
<p> 4) Avoid taking dishes to a picnic that contain uncooked or unpasteurized eggs, such as homemade salad dressings or mayonnaise:
<p> Use pasteurized eggs or egg products to make these items. Food items containing properly prepared homemade or store-bought mayonnaise need to be kept cold until just before serving.
<p> 5) Wash produce such as melons prior to serving:
<p> Bacteria can be present on the exterior of melons and can be carried into the edible section when cutting it.
<p> 6) Do not prepare food more than one day before your picnic unless it is to be frozen:
<p> Cooking foods in advance allows for more opportunities for bacteria to grow. Be sure to reheat pre-cooked foods to at least 165°F before serving.
<p> 7) Remember the one-hour rule:
<p> Do not consume any perishable foods that have been sitting out beyond one hour on days where the temperature is over 90°F. On cooler days (under 90°F), perishable foods should be returned to the cooler or discarded if not eaten within two hours.
<p> 8) Throw out leftovers:
<p> Since most picnic leftovers have been sitting out for more than 1 - 2 hours and have had many people handling them, throw them out. The more time that food has been sitting at unsafe temperatures, the more likely harmful bacteria has grown.
<p> 9) Wash hands before eating or handling food:
<p> Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before eating or handling food. If you're eating where there’s no source of clean water, bring soap, water and paper towels or have disposable wipes or hand sanitizer available.
<p> To help you with your BBQ, NSF wants to give a lucky winner a grilling prize pack!

<p> I'm not a gigantic soda drinker, but I do enjoy a glass or two every once in a while of it. The brand of soda that I drink the least is Mountain Dew. I am not saying that I dislike it, but I just prefer Sprite or Diet Coke. I recently learned that Mountain Dew has come out with some new flavors that sound interesting, and I wanted to try them.
<p> PepsiCo is a Fortune 500, American global corporation headquartered in Purchase, Harrison, New York, with interests in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay, Inc. PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi to a broader range of food and beverage brands, the largest of which include an acquisition of Tropicana in 1998 and a merger with Quaker Oats in 2001 - which added the Gatorade brand to its portfolio as well.
<p> You're familiar with such PepsiCo snacks as Lay's potato chips, Quaker brand foods and snacks, Fritos corn chips, Lipton teas and more. I was not aware of all the brands that PepsiCo produces until I did some research! :)
<p> I was sent some samples of new Mountain Dew flavors to try. I received Mountain Dew Pitch Black, Mountain Dew Supernova, and Mountain Dew Typhoon.
<p> The first thing I noticed about these soft drinks was the huge sugar content they pack. I think one flavor had 77 grams of sugar. I was shocked and also a bit nervous to drink it because that is an insane amount of sugar, so I just had a few sips of each. I also noticed these flavors were not heavily carbonated either. I loved the colors of the soft drinks though.
<p> My favorite was Supernova. It is a magenta colored strawberry-melon flavored Dew with ginseng. The color was a pretty peach. The flavor was very refreshing and fruity and would be great on a hot summer day. The carbonation level was subtle but the flavor os the strawberry melon was very prevalent. I had never tasted a soda similiar to this before. I was intrigued.
<p> Pitch black was grape flavored. I did not enjoy this flavor at all. The grape flavor was strong and very powerful. I am not a fan of grape. I did like the dark purple color though.
<p> The typhoon was a a red-orange strawberry-pineapple flavored Dew. I liked this one a lot too. The flavor was crisp and refreshing and very delicious. Strawberry and pineapple go perfect together and are such a classic combination. I would love to use this in a punch for a party. I think everyone would love it.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking SIX (6) winners for this contest. Six winners will win a coupon for a free 12 pack of bottles or cans of any flavor of Pepsi-Cola carbonated soft drinks.

<p> I put my hair up frequently. I like to get it out of my face. I'm pretty unoriginal with how I put it up though. I either do it in a messy bun sort of style or just a ponytail. Pretty boring right? I'm always looking for new ways to wear my hair and Whirl-A-Style has taken my request and made it a reality!
<p> Lois Sonstegard is internationally respected as ‘THE Upstyle Hair Design Resource’. Whirl-a-Style hair accessories are also internationally recognized as the leading upstyle and hair styling design accessories in the world, with successful sales across many professional and fashion retail categories, including the salon, spa, dance, cheerleader, bridal, military, and general retail markets. Whirl-A-Style consists of three different, yet related hairstyling products: Whirl-a-Style, Klicinz and Poppi.
<p> Whirl-A-Style is a simple to use hair styling tool designed for the woman on the go! This easy to use hair styling tool allows you to pull your hair back into a twist or bun without the need for clips or hair ties. It also has a special slit so it provides less strain and pull on the hair itself for less breakage. The Whirl-A-Style comes in 5 sizes and 12 colors.
<p> I was sent a brown Whirl-A-Style for review purposes. I think this product is great for women, especially moms on the go who don't have time to really do their hair. This tool will allow them to still have a fun and trendy hair style, but in a much quicker way.
<p> The hair styling tool matches my hair perfectly which is good because it blends in well. I was sent instructions and an instructional DVD with my styling tool. I've used products like this before so I figured I could easily get the hang of it. It's not as simple as I remember and it did take some practice and getting used to before I could securely have it in my hair. I have longer hair so it takes some practice when you use the tool before you get it 100% right. I like that there's so many different hair styles you can achieve by using this. I slid my hair through the slit and followed the instructions which told me to roll it up. I rolled it up and snapped it into a funky bun updo. I really like it because you can achieve elegant updo's that look like you spent hours in a salon getting it done, but for a fraction of the cost!
<p> An informational video showing how to create a bun with the Whirl-A-Style.
<p> The tool is easy to use once you get the hang of it, and it's fun to create many different styles. The tool stays securely in your hair and is not uncomfortable to wear in any way, and it doesn't weigh on your head either.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Whirl-A-Style hair tool.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me what kind of updo you would like to achieve with the Whirl-A-Style. (1 entry)

<p> There's nothing in this world that I love more than chocolate. I am not too much of a plain chocolate lover, oh no. My chocolate has to be busy. Even when I make brownies I throw in M&amp;M's, and pretzel bits, etc. I love chocolate that is bold and has lots of personality. Suzi's Sweet Shoppe shares my philosophy on chocolate and for that she is a smart woman.
<p> Suzi's Sweet Shoppe knows that creating premium chocolate is an art that requires great skill, passion and dedication. Nobody knows that better than the owners of Suzi’s Sweet Shoppe, Susan and Stan Hordych. Since opening their doors in 1998, they’ve developed and refined their unique hand-dipped chocolates and candy with absolute devotion. It’s evident in every tongue-tingling sweet they produce.
<p> Much care and attention goes into each and every confection. Staying true to time-honored recipes and old-world craftsmanship, they use only the highest quality and freshest ingredients in all their sweets. Preparation is carefully monitored, from mixing and cooking the ingredients, to measuring and cutting the pieces.
<p> The sweet treats at Suzi's are mouth-wateringly delicious. When you walk into the shop, you're basically walking into chocolate heaven. Whether you desire fudge, chocolate covered pretzels, truffles, gift sets, sugar free specialities and more, they have you covered. Any kind of chocolate your sugar laden heart desires, Suzi's carries.
<p> I received a package from Suzi and it was filled with chocolate-y goodness. As I took each item out of the package my sweet tooth emerged more and more. I received a chocolate treat in the shape of an old fashioned top hat. The treat was made out of milk chocolate and had oreo cookie and marshmallow inside. I received a very large S'Mores, and a huge box of chocolate covered pretzels. Each pretzel was different and contained sprinkles, M&amp;M's, and more! Lastly I received a large chocolate covered Twinkie with white chocolate drizzle. Oh My! Suzi really knew the key to my heart and she's turned that key quite well! :) I'm sorry that I don't have a picture of the S'Mores. I forgot to take a picture of it before I had a few bites.
<p> So far I've only tried a few bites of the S'mores and the pretzels. The S'mores was gigantic! It was a huge chocolate covered marshmallow packin' graham cracker extravaganza. I had never seen anything like it before. It was so big that I could barely take a bite, I had to break off a piece! The only thing that I regret not doing is heating it up in the microwave, like a true S'more. I had it unheated and it was still delicious though. Upon first bite you are hit with a wave of flavors all at once. It is so delightful. You taste the sweet milk chocolate covering the crunchy and flakey graham cracker walls. Then, following that, you taste the fluffy, sweet marshmallow. Your taste buds are in chocolate nirvana and there's no stopping them! A S'mores is the perfect treat for any age. There's just something so comforting and fabulous about the combination of marshmallow, graham crackers, and chocolate. It's a magical trifecta of deliciousness.
<p> I had a chocolate covered M&amp;M pretzel next. Each pretzel is so pretty I had a hard time eating it! The pretzel is a very decent size. You're not eating some dinky little pretzel, mind you. This pretzel is large and in charge and packs some serious flavor. It's so visually pleasing too with the perfect chocolate color and the multi-colored M&amp;M's. Upon first bite, you taste the milk chocolate and the crunchy, salty combination of the pretzel all at once. It's the perfect combination and the flavors swirl together and your senses are in chocolate pretzel bliss! The M&amp;M's are crunchy and add an even sweeter twist to an already perfect treat. You can't get any better than this. It's the perfect afternoon treat too. Just pair it with a glass of milk and let the chocolate melt away all of your troubles.
<p> I haven't tried the rest of Suzi's sweets yet, but I can guarantee you that they are absolutely fabulous. I highly recommend that you try some of Suzi's sweets in the near future. :)

<p> I'm sure you're familiar with Cars, the popular movie for children. Well, get ready to start your engines again! On June 24th, Cars 2 is out and the characters are sure to get into a great adventure.
<p> Kimberly Clark and Cars have joined up for a special loyalty rewards program. I love when companies reward me for using my favorite items. What a win-win!
<p> The Kimberly-Clark integrated commercial program for Cars 2 spans the Kleenex, Cottonelle, Scott, Viva, Huggies and Pull-Up brands and provides in/centives for mom to stock up on Kimberly-Clark essentials and keep her family on track this summer.
<p> The Kimberly-Clark and Disney program will provide mom with the solutions she needs for her job as the family’s Pit Crew Chief, while helping her earn great Cars 2 rewards for her crew—including movie tickets, coloring books, character die-cast cars and more!
<p> The more Kimberly-Clark products mom buys for summer stock-up, the more credits she can redeem for premium Cars 2 items. Visit Kimberly Clark to learn more.
<p> To earn Cars 2 rewards, simply purchase participating Kimberly-Clark brands with the Cars 2 label and enter the code found in the black box on the label at Kimberly Clark
<p> Products can be purchased in multiple transactions and codes can be entered until September 30, 2011. After you enter the code, you will receive a free gift voucher delivered by mail for die-cast Cars 2 vehicles, Visa prepaid cards, Cars 2 movie tickets and more. The more products purchased, the higher the rewards.
<p> I received complimentary baby wipes, Cottonelle bath tissue, and Kleenex for this sponsored post. The tissues and bath tissue will are definitely needed. I do not have a baby but I know many people who do, so the wipes will come in handy for them.
<p> The Cars 2 branded products are so cute and your child will enjoy using them when he/she sees that they are branded with their favorite movie! Make sure to take your child to see Cars 2!
<p> *Other than the Kleenex, Cottonelle, and Huggies products that I was sent from Kimberly-Clark due to my membership at Mom Bloggers Club, I was not provided with any other compensation. This review is strictly my opinion and not influenced by anything else.

<p> I love experimenting with different flavors for coffee. Coffee is fabulous but sometimes it needs to be spiced up. Cinnamon hazelnut coffee with a hint of brown sugar? Delicious. How about Vanilla Chai coffee with cinnamon sprinkled in it? Even better. When I discovered Bailey's Creamers, I was in love. It was the answer to my flavored coffee obsession.
<p> People have loved the silky, creamy richness and renowned flavor of Baileys Original Irish Cream since it was created over 30 years ago. So we thought (and soon found out we were not alone), wouldn't it be great if people could enjoy the rich flavor Baileys is known for in their coffee anytime they want? So we came up with Bailey's Coffee Creamers— delicious, non-alcoholic flavored coffee creamers, with all the quality and great taste for which Baileys is known.
<p> I went to the store tonight after work and chose the French vanilla creamer. I had a cup of decaf coffee when I got home from the store and couldn't wait to try the new liquid deliciousness in my mug. The bottle is very stylish. It's black and features a flower on the top to represent French vanilla. The bottom has a golden brown swirl design on it, which reminds me of coffee.
<p> The container was easy to open and poured smoothly into my mug. I could smell the creamer as I poured it and it smelled fantastic! I was just drinking plain coffee on purpose as I didn't want a flavored coffee to interfere with the taste of the creamer. I took a sip and it was wonderful. The warm coffee revived me after a long day and the taste of French vanilla was extremely prevalent. The creamer was not especially overwhelming but provided just enough of a vanilla flavor. It was delicious! It really gave my coffee personality and pizazz and I enjoyed it immensely. This was the best cup of coffee I've had in quite a long time. I am not sure I can drink my coffee without this wonderful addition now! I am looking forward to trying the other flavors from Baileys, I am sure they will be equally as great!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TWO (2) winners for this contest. Two winners will win three free product coupons each to purchase Bailey's Creamers with.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Now that hot weather is here, I get to wear cute bathing suits to the beach and pool all the time. It's important to me that I look my best in them and have a stylish swim suit, so for that I turned to Voda Swim.
<p> VodaSwim is a division of Voda Fashion LLC based in Los Angeles, California. Voda Swim is an upscale swimwear brand founded by Yulia and her husband Dustin. Yulia has always had a true passion for fashion. When she was a little girl she would make dresses for her dolls, sweaters for her dog, and clothes for herself. Utilizing the highest quality fabrics and comfortable designs in classic solids and beautiful prints, Voda Swim is designed for sexy, confident, and athletic women.
<p> I love the swim suits that Voda Swim offers. They are fun, vibrant and full of personality. I was sent the Essence Envy Push Up® Tankini &amp; adjustable scoop. Who said less is more? The Envy Push Up® Tankini swimsuit top covers all the right areas and falls low enough to cover the mid-section, but still accentuates your sexy side. The Adjustable Scoop swimsuit bottoms can go from demure to daring with the pull of the side ties. Perfect for the woman who wants different swimwear bottoms for different occasions.
<p> End caps are 14K gold plated and are chlorine and salt water resistant Body: nylon/spandex, lining: polyester/spandex Fully lined Top: ties at neck and back Full coverage Made in USA
<p> I really love this bathing suit. In the summer I go to the pool and beach a lot and it's always nice to have a new bathing suit to wear. The print of the swimsuit is really cute and reminds me of paisley. I've even gotten compliments already when I wore it the indoor pool yesterday!
<p> The suit fits me well and is comfortable to wear although I can tell it runs a little bit small, so it might be best to order the next size up if you purchase one through the website. I love the envy push up of the swimsuit as it gives me a little bit more on top and increases your bust size 1 to 2 cups. It looks like a normal bathing suit top and gives you great support, has no sagging or underwires, and features low water absorbency. I've had my fair share of dealing with those annoying padded inserts that would pop out of your bathing suit in the wash or even when you were swimming. They left me with no support and just made my bathing suit top look awkward. It was also hard to get them back in 100% how they should be. I was very happy that this swimsuit was not like all of the other so called "push ups."
<p> The ties on the swimsuit bottom are adjustable, although I didn't change mine at all, I prefer it the way it is. I might eventually adjust it though. I prefer a tankini rather than a bikini because it covers you more. I've washed the suit already once and it has been fine and no issues with bleeding dye or colors occured. I can't wait to wear this suit more this summer!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a swimsuit of their choice from Vodaswim.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
