<p> I've been wanting to go camping for a while now. I am not an extremely outdoorsy kind of girl, but there's something that I just love about camping. Skip the hike and let's go straight to the campsite! :) I went camping quite a number of years ago and really enjoyed it. There's just something fun about roasting marshmallows and sleeping underneath the stars.
<p> Come and Get-it is a camping supplies and outdoor gear online company. They sell backpacks, headlamps, tents, water bottles, outdoor apparel and anything else you could need to assist you with your camping or hiking adventures!
<p> I asked to review a tent because of course how could I go camping without one? I never knew so many different kinds of tents existed before I stumbled upon this website. I finally settled on the Mountain Trails South Bend Sport Dome Tent. This is a 4 person tent.
<p> I have not had the opportunity to use this tent yet, but I am planning a camping trip with my boyfriend towards the end of summer. I am excited and can't wait to go! This is a very roomy tent and will fit us both comfortably. I picked a 4 person tent instead of the 2 person because I like the roominess and the extra space. Also, who wants to be crowded inside of something when you don't have to? I like how the different colors of the tent are layered. I have not put together the tent yet but I do not think it will be too difficult to do. Since the tent only weighs 7 lbs it is pretty lightweight and won't be that heavy to carry, which is nice. The mud mat which comes with the tent is extremely helpful to keep the floor of the tent free from dirt and mud, etc. The utility pocket and gear loft would be great for keeping a cell phone or GPS (if you're going for a hike) within reach. I can't wait to use this tent and I'm sure I'll love it!
<p> Planning on making a purchase? Please use the discount code SAMMIBOL for 20% off your entire order.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Mountain Trails South Bend Sport Dome Tent.

<p> I did a review with Omaha Steaks a few months ago and I was beyond impressed with their delicious foods. I knew I had to do another review. You all know Omaha Steaks, a company that ships the freshest and juiciest cuts of meat, desserts, sides, and more. They are the perfect gift for any foodie. The foods also make a great dinner any day of the week.
<p> Omaha Steaks is a fifth-generation, family-owned company with a passion for providing the finest in premium beef and gourmet foods for our family of customers. Whether you're looking for a fantastic steak, succulent lobster tails, or a rich and creamy cheesecake, Omaha Steaks has you covered.
<p> I was sent a 4 pack of filet mignons and a 4 pack of mini individual New York cheesecakes. Doesn't this picture just make you wish it was dinner time right now?
<p> I made one steak for myself the other night. I love that this pack comes with 4 steaks because it contains many dinners in one convenient pack. I didn't season the steak beforehand because it looked like it was already very flavorful. As it cooked, the aroma of deliciousness permeated through my kitchen. It smelled so wonderful and I couldn't wait to try it. My lady bug kitchen timer went off and I knew it was time to dig in! The steak was cooked perfectly and it looked so tender and juicy. It surely was a piece of heaven disguised in the form of steak, I thought! I poured a little bit of BBQ sauce on my plate to dip the meat in. I cut the first piece, dipped it into the sauce, and let the fragrant meat meet its match with my stomach. The meat was simply amazing. It was tender, fresh, juicy, and had a great natural flavor to it. I truly loved it. The BBQ sauce also gave the meat a nice small kick of flavor which was great too. The meat had the perfect amount of chew and firmness.
<p> Of course I saved room for dessert, you must be crazy if you thought I didn't! The individual cheesecakes were cute and it was just the right amount to satisfy your craving for something sweet. The cheesecake was tangy and tart and simply perfect. It was sweet with the perfect amount of creaminess to it. It was by far the best piece of cheesecake I've had in a long time. The crust was perfectly toasted and had a great crunchiness to it. I always love the crust on the cheesecake, it's a great balance and structure to the creaminess. It was truly delicious!
<p> All in all, it was a great meal. Omaha Steaks has outdone itself again!
<p> Looking for great grill items for that upcoming BBQ of yours? Check out this awesome tailgating package. Your guests will be in meat heaven!

<p> You know what isn't easy? Trying to hold up your towel around you after a shower. You're cold and the towel doesn't easily stay up. You just want to get dressed as quickly as possible, right? That's where CottonAge steps in to help.
<p> CottonAge is a manufacturer and direct importer of fine Turkish cotton bathrobes and towels. Most of the bathrobes and towels we offer are manufactured in Turkey while a few select styles and Spa Accessories are imported from our partner manufacturers for a wider variety of product selection.
<p> The products available on the website look comfortable and very luxurious! Also offered are body wrap towels, headbands, slippers, hair wrap towels, and totebags. Personalization is also available for gifts.
<p> I was sent a new product for review. I received a waffle body wrap towel.
<p> This wrap reminds me of one of those extremely comfortable and cushy white waffle hotel robes. You know the ones that make you want to just lay around all day in them while having spa services done? Haha. This wrap is perfect for wearing after a shower since it's hands free. You put it around you and you can walk from the bathroom to the bedroom and won't have to worry about holding your towel up. The wrap fits well, it's a one size fits all kind of thing, so it adjusts to you. It's easy to adjust and stays on well too. The material is comfortable and does not itch or scratch me at all. The pocket is convenient for putting a hair brush or hair tie in it for doing your hair after a shower. Since I'm only 5'0, the wrap is kind of long on me, but on a taller person it would be the perfect length for them.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a body waffle wrap towel from CottonAge.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me why you would like to win this waffle wrap towel. (1 entry)

<p> Watching your sugar intake is very important for your everyday health, and of course your teeth. It's okay to have sugar in moderation but why not do what you can to make your sugar intake more healthier?
<p> Life is sweet. Splenda sweetener products make it even sweeter, by giving you a delicious alternative to sugar. Use it just about anywhere sugar is used and you’ll discover why it’s America’s favorite no calorie sweetener.
<p> Instead of using regular sugar in baking or cooking, why not use a great alternative? Splenda measures cup for cup like sugar and also sweetns like 1.6 lbs of sugar but for much less! Make a delicious batch of blueberry muffins today with less guilt from all of the sugar you normally use for the recipe!
<p> Splenda has new products that were just recently released that I know you're going to absolutely love.
<p> Splenda granulated 1 gram of fiber per teaspoon. It has the same sweet taste as sugar. This product contains 3 grams of fiber in every tablespoon. That's the same amount of fiber as a 1/2 cup of oat bran! What's better than having something sweet but getting great health benefits from it at the same time?
<p> Splenda Essentials with B vitamins is the next product that was recently released. This Splenda product helps support a healthy metabolism. It has 20% of daily value of B vitamins (B1 B5 and B6) in each packet.

<p> Exercising is important to me. I try to exercise a few times a week, even though that's not always a possiblity for me. I like to wear comfortable shoes that have the proper support level for my fitness routine. I do a lot of cardio and jumping and I want to make sure my feet don't suffer from wearing the wrong shoes. Thanks to Ropix my feet will be smiling instead of crying! :)
<p> History of Ropix as told by the creator:Ropix started as an idea in a boxing gym in NYC in 1991. As all boxers do, I began to incorporate jumping rope into my training. Before long I knew I did not have the right shoes. The more I jumped, the more I hurt later in the day. After a long search, I discovered that there were no proper shoes available for this purpose. Boxing shoes didn't have any cushioning, and running shoes had too much cushioning. I discovered that the "cross-trainer" is the recommended shoe for jump rope. As the name implies, these shoes are for multiple purposes and attempt to cover a wide range of activities. The "cross-trainer" was invented more as a marketing need rather than an equipment requirement. In fact, The American Academy of Podiatric Sports Medicine supports the policy of sports-specific shoes and advises against the use of cross training shoes for most uses.
<p> Years later, I finally decided to create a shoe that would fit this need. Ropix are the first of its kind, not only specific to jumping rope, but suitable for all forefoot activities. Because of the tailored cushioning, Ropix are beneficial for any sport or activity that place impact on the balls of your feet. They are also lightweight, comfortable and perfect for casual wear.
<p> Ropix is perfect for a person's active lifestyle. The shoes support in many different ways.
<p> I was sent a pair of the Turbo black and silver shoes for review. I am in love with them!
<p> I love the combination of the black and silver together, it's very modern and stylish. The shoe fits me comfortably which is very important. It's not too big or too small, but just perfect! I've never owned a pair of fitness shoes before with velcro closures. I think it will come in handy because there are no laces to come untied at a very inconvenient time. The shoes feel very lightweight when wearing them. I did a cardio workout tonight at home to test these shoes out. I incorporate a jump rope into my workouts for an extra added boost of cardio. I usually wear a pair of shoes that hurt my feet after, but I never knew of a solution until finding out about these shoes. I wore these shoes during my workout and at the end my feet did not hurt at all like they normally do. The shoes provided stability and comfort as well. I was impressed, shocked, and extremely pleased. These shoes were the answer to my foot problems! I will definitely be trading in my old shoes for these new wonderful Ropix's!
<p> Thanks to Ropix for revamping my workout completely!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a pair of Ropix shoes in the Turbo black and silver style.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Music is constantly playing in my house. Whether it's from internet radio, the actual radio, or my ipod, some form of music is always on. I find it peaceful and calming and of course I love to sing along to my favorite songs. :)
<p> RCA Corporation, founded as the Radio Corporation of America, was an electronics company in existence from 1919 to 1986. RCA has been a leader in electronics for many years. They are most memorable for phonographs in the 1920's and 1930's. You might know RCA from their televisions, radio's, and more in present day. They are also memorable for Nipper the dog in their ads.
<p> I've had previous experience with RCA products and they have never failed or disappointed me. I've had an RCA portable dvd player for a few years now and it still continues to work great.
<p> I was sent an RCA Ipod dock for review.
<p> I was very excited to be able to review this ipod dock because the ipod dock I have now is old and doesn't play as well as it could. The one I have now doesn't have a clock or a radio, it is simply just an ipod dock with no bells and whistles.
<p> Features:-Set two different "his and hers" wake times.-High performance sound system.-Audio input for mp3 player connection.-"No worry" battery backup.-Soft touch front control keys.-Wake to alarm, radio, or ipod.-Automatic time set.
<p> The dock is also compatible with past iPod models and iPhones, along with the iPhone 3GS.
<p> I love this dock! I have already set it up this morning and have had my music rockin' through it. The ipod easily slips into the compartment for it and plays with ease. The clarity of the music was great and it sounded awesome in the speakers. This dock would be great for playing music for parties as well.
<p> The dock is nice enough to display on a table or even in a wall unit. It doesn't take up too much space either. It's a sleek grey color that is neutral enough to easily blend in with whatever decor you have. I love that it's a flat panel unit. The clock was easy to set and the time is easily viewable and readable with a large number display. I like that this dock also features a radio too just in case you'd like to switch from your iPod to the radio. The radio comes in loud and clear and the station buttons are easy to change too.
<p> I don't normally wake up to an actual clock alarm as I use my cell phone for an alarm. If I did want to use an alarm, I would use this one because the his and her wake times are really convenient and helpful. I wake up after my boyfriend in the mornings so it would be nice to not to have to depend on setting a cell phone alarm each night. I could put both of our wake times in there and we can wake up to either an alarm, the radio, or the iPod. The ipod also charges in the dock, so no need to worry about using the wall charger.
<p> This dock would make a great gift for any music enthusiast too.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a RCA iPod dock.
<p> Winner will be chosen on August 3, 2011 at 10 pm and then will be emailed.One entry per day.Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours.

<p> Clean hands are very important to me. I regularly wash my hands a few times a day just because I touch so many things a day. I hate the feeling of dirty hands. Wet Ones knows exactly how I feel because they produce awesome antibacterical products.
<p> Wet Ones antibacterical hand wipes are an effective alternative to clean hands and prevent the spread of germs. These hand wipes are proven to be just as effective as gel hand sanitizers in killing 99.99% of germs, but they also clean better than hand sanitizer gels. They wipe away dirt and messes without drying out skin like alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
<p> Wet ones wipes are portable and can be used in any situation where soap and water is not available. They come in convenient sizes that can be discreetly packed into school lunchboxes, tucked into jeans and jacket pockets, or used whenever a sink is out of reach. They are also great to clean up dirt and messes at school, from the classroom to the playground.
<p> The wipes are available in two fragrances, fresh, and a new and improved citrus scent. They come in three convenient forms:40 count canister, which is designed to fit into a standard car cup holder.-15 count travel pack-24 count box of individually wrapped single wipes.
<p> I was sent three Wet Ones products for review. I received a canister of Wet Ones antibacterial hand wipes in the fresh scent, a travel pack of hand wipes in the fresh scent, and a box of individually wrapped pocket size singles hand wipes. All of these products will surely keep my hands germ-free!
<p> I really love that these products are made with convenience in mind. The pocket size singles are perfect for tossing a few in my purse whenever I can't wash my hands. I live in New York City so I often have to deal with touching the disgusting germ filled poles on the subway when there is not a seat available. Using one of these handy wipes after I get off the train would ease my mind instantly instead of waiting till I get home to wash my hands, like I usually have to.
<p> The travel pack is great because it is reclosable so the wipes won't dry out, and can easily be thrown into a suitcase for traveling.
<p> The canister would be great for a mom to throw into her car for her children just in case there are any messes along the way that need a quick clean-up.
<p> The wipe was very easy to get out of the travel pack and was easily reclosable too. The wipe does not feel very "wet" at first touch like some other antibacterial wipes do, which I liked. It has a pleasant, fresh scent. The only thing I didn't like was that the wetness of the wipe did not dry instantly. I had to rinse my hands off because they felt "sticky." My hands maintained the scent of the wipe and they definitely do feel clean. I love knowing that I'm killing anything harmful on my hands with just a quick swipe of a wipe over my hands. The pocket size singles will definitely be kept into my purse for any time I need them!
<p> One lucky winner will win a Wet Ones prize pack featuring a Wet ones lunch tote, a box of pocket size singles wipes, a travel pack of reclosable wipes, and a canister of wipes.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a prize pack of Wet ones items featuring a Wet ones lunch tote, a box of pocket size singles wipes, a travel pack of reclosable wipes, and a canister of wipes.

<p> Pasta is a huge favorite food of mine. I love that there's so many ways to prepare it and of course you can't forget how great it tastes! I would say tortellini and spaghetti are my absolute two favorites. Add a little basil, a hearty marinara sauce, and some parmesean cheese and you've got me drooling. :)
<p> For four generations, Barilla has been bringing the flavors of Italy to your table and the spirit of Italy to your life. Barilla believes sharing a meal can help build closer relationships with family and friends. We want you to embrace the good life by discovering the lifestyle, culture and rich heritage of Italy.
<p> Barilla offers so many different types of pasta that there's always new ways to jazz it up. How about ziti with shrimp and sausage with a vodka or marinara sauce? Or maybe penne with diced chicken in an alfredo sauce? They both sound awesome!
<p> The pasta that Barilla sells would be perfect for creating a refreshing summer pasta salad. How about a base of cheese tortellini with a little bit of cheese, peppers, and some cucumber? Be creative and add your favorite ingredients for a delectable lunch.
<p> One winner will win two bags (one large and one small) of Barilla tortellini. The flavors will be three cheese and spinach and cheese.

<p> I go to the beach a lot in the summer, so it's imperative that I have a few swimsuits on hand at all times. I love really pretty swimsuits with lots of personality and color. Aerin Rose offers me just that in such a stylish way!
<p> Aerin Rose sells fashionable swimsuits in a variety of styles and colors. Whether you're looking for tankini's, one piece's, or bikini's, they have you covered. They also have a full figured collection. The swimsuits provide great support as well.
<p> I was sent a banded halter tankini called "Peacock" for review.
<p> Our most popular tankini style! This sought-after style, which features halter neck and back ties and hidden underwire for subtle support, now comes with removable padded inserts.Coordinates perfectly with our solid bottoms. Choose the Highwaist bottom for full-coverage or a Scoop style for a more revealing look.
<p> From the second I saw this swimsuit, I had to have it. It's so gorgeous! It instantly stood out to me when I was picking out a suit to review. I don't currently have any swimsuit like this one. When I received it in the mail, I couldn't wait to try it on to see how it looked. I've ordered swimsuits from catalogs before and I hate the way they look on, so I was happy and relived to see this swimsuit fit me with no problems at all. The suit was easy to take off and put on too. I've had swimsuits before that were very tight in the chest area, but this one was fine. I love the beautiful peacock-esque colors and the pattern is so fun! I have already washed the swimsuit once after wearing it and there was no issues with washing or drying it. Everything remained intact. I can't wait to wear this swimsuit to the beach in the final summer months. :)
