<p> Stainless steel and granite can be very hard to maintain and keep clean. There are many products out there that guarantee streak-free cleaning, but that just isn't the case.
<p> Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner is the leader of non-toxic, biodegradable, environmentally safer cleaning products used for household cleaning, appliances, carpet care, and more. Many different products are available through this line including all purpose cleaner, dishwashing liquid, liquid hand soap, glass and surface care, dog stain and odor cleaner, and much more.
<p> I was sent a Simple Green household products kit. I receibed 3 16 oz. spray bottles of SG's ready-to-use specialty cleaning products including their Simple Green Stainless Steel 1-step Cleaner/Polish, Simple Green Stone Cleaner, and Simple Green Stone Polish. The main point with this kit is to introduce the amazing formulas they have created for cleaning high-end kitchen and bath surfaces like stainless steel, brass, granite, corian, silestone, marble and many other surfaces found in modern homes. All are ready to use and all are, of course, non-toxic and biodegradable.
<p> Last time I visited my parents, I had this kit sent to them so I could use it on their stainless steel fridge, stove, dishwasher, and granite countertop. I tried the stainless steel cleaner on the previously mentioned appliances and they cleaned fantastically. Stainless steel is notorious for showing fingerprints very easily. A spray of this solution cleaned all of the fingerprints off very nicely. The solution sprayed on very easily and wiped away cleanly and easily. No greasy residue, fingerprints, or shine remained afterwards. The appliances gleamed with cleanliness and had a streak free glow.
<p> I used the stone polish on the countertops too and the polish cleaned very well too. The product gave the countertops a nice gloss after they were polished and they shined nicely. Both products had no harsh fumes or a chemical smell either. Both my parents and I were very pleased with the results of both products. I have not tried the stone cleaner yet, but I'm sure it works fantastically too. I will certainly be using these again!

<p> Eclairs are little bite sized pieces of heaven. They are great party desserts and a favorite among everyone. What's not to love about cold creamy chocolate pastries?
<p> Delizza is prepared from an original Belgian recipe. Products from Delizza include Mini Cream Puffs, Mini Éclairs and other tasty pastries are the best Europe has to offer. A rich dairy cream filling makes these desserts a great complement to after-dinner coffee and perfect for any entertaining occasion. Cover them with hot chocolate sauce, sprinkle them with powdered sugar, enjoy them with ice cream, fresh fruit or your own original topping recipe. Just Thaw &amp; Serve.
<p> I was sent a coupon to try any Delizza dessert. My store only carried cream puffs and eclairs. It was a hard toss-up, but the eclairs ended up winning. Other products include Belgian double chocolate mini eclairs and Belgian mini chocolate dipped cream puffs (which sound amazing!)
<p> I really enjoyed the eclairs. They come in a box of 30 which is great for serving at any social gathering or event. They are bite sized and so cute. They had the perfect blanket of chocolate on top with a delicious, creamy center. The pastry was a great golden color. When you bite into the pastry, you're hit with a fabulous layer of chocolate which is sweet and just perfect. The pastry is soft and moist and wonderful. Your tastebuds then pick up the cool cream of the center of the treat. The cream is sweet, luscious, and rich. It pairs perfectly with the chocolate and the pastry. The pastry is fresh and the epitome of perfection and it's hard to not have more than one! :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking FOUR (4) winners who will win a free product coupon good towards any Delizza dessert.2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win this coupon.. (1 entry)

<p> Bambi is a movie for all ages. It's a heartwarming tale of the animated story of Bambi, a young deer hailed as the 'Prince of the Forest' at his birth. As Bambi grows, he makes friends with the other animals of the forest, learns the skills needed to survive, and even finds love. One day, however, the hunters come, and Bambi must learn to be as brave as his father if he is to lead the other deer to safety.
<p> I think this movie is a perfect movie for children and adults alike. Everyone can enjoy adorable little Bambi and his forest adventures. This film teaches trustworthiness, love, and responsibility. I like that this film is on BluRay+DVD because not everyone owns a bluray player.

<p> As you all know I'm a lover of sweets. While I may love a nice piece of grilled chicken with steamed vegetables, I still have a junk food side to me. The junk food side has taken the best of me and because of this, I have about 20 pounds to lose. I've been wanting to lose the weight for about a year now.
<p> Nutrisystem has signed me up for a complimentary 4 months on their program. In return, every week I will update you on how I'm doing on the plan/my thoughts/and my weight loss.

<p> Like the saying goes, a smile is worth 1000 words, so why not keep your smile looking great? A smile is very important and it's one of the first things people notice about you when meeting for the first time.
<p> About Aquafresh:Aquafresh is a brand of toothpaste that has been on sale since 1973. It is manufactured by consumer healthcare product maker GlaxoSmithKline. Various flavors and styles of toothpaste are manufactured that cater to teeth and cavity protection, whitening, and fresh breath. Aquafresh has also started a line of toothbrushes for children and adults. In 2004, they introduced the Max-Active brand, which was promoted as the first to fit the size of any tooth.
<p> I was sent a can of Aquafresh Iso-Active Whitening "Lasting Impact" toothpaste.
<p> Aquafresh iso-active Whitening doesn’t look like an ordinary toothpaste, and it doesn't act like one, either! Aquafresh iso-active whitening is a breakthrough gel that transforms into an active foam penetrating hard-to-reach places and protecting – front, back and in-between. This toothpaste is available in three fresh varieties: Fresh Impact, Deep Impact and Lasting Impact.
<p> This toothpaste is very unique. I like the packaging of it and the bright green is very recognizable. The can is very distinguishable from a typical tube of toothpaste too, and I liked the push down top. This it toothpaste is great as it keeps your teeth and gums healthy, and promotes fresh breath. This toothpaste states that it provides 33% better whitening compared to a non-whitening toothpaste. The whitening agent of the toothpaste is very important to me as I want my teeth to look their best at all times.
<p> I really liked this toothpaste. I've been using Aquafresh for years so this brand is no stranger to me. The toothpaste is not actually a paste, but a gel. Once you start brushing your teeth with it, the gel turns to foam. It does foam up a lot, which could be a turn off for some. The flavor of the toothpaste is pleasant though. This minty formula toothpaste gets teeth clean and white, and breath minty fresh. It does cost more than some other toothpaste out there but I feel that people would be willing to spend more as oral healthcare is important. I have not used the toothpaste long enough to notice any significant whitening, but hopefully in time I will.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking FOUR (4) winners who will win a can of Aquafresh Isoactive Whitening Toothpaste. 2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win this toothpaste. (1 entry)

<p> I'm all for good tasting, wholesome, snacks. There's nothing better than indulging in something that not only tastes good, but is good for you at the same time.
<p> About Hippie Chow:Our gourmet granola is made with all natural ingredients. You won't find any artificial flavors or preservatives in our food, thank you.Each batch is handmade to ensure premium quality and freshness. It's a lot of work but we think our customers are worth it. (taken from website.)
<p> I was sent 6 bags of Hippie Chow plus a reusable totebag. I received 3 flavors and 2 bags each of original, peanut butter, and chocolate. The totebag could come in handy for taking to the beach or a picnic in the park once the weather gets warmer.
<p> The peanut butter granola features banana chips, coconut &amp; walnuts. The chocolate is pure cocoa bliss, and the original has almonds pecans and cranberries. All 3 flavors were very fresh and provided a great crunch that was bursting with great flavor. Each bag was 10 oz and held a lot of granola! I really liked that the bags are reclosable after you are done snacking.
<p> I've had chocolate granola before and really loved it. Some can be extremely rich though, so I was hoping it wasn't too sweet. This granola curtailed my sweet tooth but had a subtle cocoa taste that I loved. It was excellent! The color of the granola was a perfect dark brown. It smelled delicious too and I really enjoyed trying it.
<p> When I opened the bag of peanut butter granola to sample it, it smelled like I just opened a jar of peanut butter! It smelled fabulous. I had never tried peanut butter granola before, so I knew I was in for a treat. I like that healthy banana chips, coconut and walnut pieces were combined in the granola too. Having a granola that is full of important nutrients that your body needs on a daily basis is vital. The banana chips were crunchy and had a great flavor. The granola was crunchy and had a great peanut butter taste that was full of flavor. It was like I was eating a peanut butter sandwich! I would not think to pair coconut and walnut together, but surprisingly they do go well together and the flavors combined are unique.
<p> Lastly, I tried the original mix granola. This is the most popular form of granola available, in my opinion. Everyone loves sweet tangy cranberries, crunchy and toasted almonds and pecans paired with granola that offers a satisfying crunch. How can you go wrong? I am a big fan of cranberries so I was looking forward to trying this granola. The fruit had a great fresh red color and provided a great tangy sweetness that I absolutely loved. The almonds and pecans were fresh as well and paired well with the granola. This would be a perfect snack to take with you on a hike or walk.
<p> These granola's are perfect for children to have as snacks because they are enjoying something that tastes good but also is very healthy too. They will love the different flavors that Hippie Chow offers.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win 6 bags of Hippie Chow granola plus a reusable totebag.2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win this Hippie Chow prize pack. (1 entry)

<p> Remember when I told you a few weeks ago I was going to be interviewed for Newsday, a Long Island, NY newspaper for a Petcakes story? Well, I was interviewed last week and now the story has been published! My blog is mentioned! So exciting.
<p> The link is here. http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/li-toy-manufacturers-market-plush-petcakes-1.2686533
<p> Valentine's Day is not complete without something sweet and tasty. Baskin Robbins does a great job of providing its consumers with great Valentine's Day cakes, shakes, ice cream, and sundaes. Why not do something sweet for your Valentine?
<p> Two cakes were introduced for Valentine's Day.
<p> Sweetheart Ice Cream Cake A sweet and simple way to say “I love you,” the Sweetheart cake is ¼-round and dotted with adorable mini red icing hearts, a red chocolate heart and a single red rose. Serves up to 8. $12.99.
<p> Chocolate Dipped Strawberry Ice Cream Cake Made with layers of Very Berry Strawberry and Chocolate ice cream, the 6-inch fully decorated round is frosted with rich chocolate-flavored whipped topping, topped with a strawberry glaze and features a customized love note. Serves up to 8. $19.99.
<p> My local Baskin Robbins was all out of Valentine's Day themed cakes, so I chose a Double Chocolate Indulgence Cake that was still delicious even though it wasn't red and heart shaped. I was sent a gift card to try out a cake for review purposes.
<p> Doesn't this just look heavenly? The cake is beautiful! This cake has layers of chocolate ice cream and devil's food cake covered in chocolate frosting. Topped with fudge rosettes, caramel drizzle and European chocolates, it's a chocolate-lover's dream.
<p> I loved this cake. It's small and compact and fits in my small freezer well. It served 6-8 so my boyfriend and I will have leftovers for awhile. The devil's food cake was moist and delicious and went well with the creamy ice cream. The chocolate frosting was sweet and amazing. The fudge rosettes were full of great chocolate flavor. The caramel drizzle and European chocolates topped off the whole cake and made it fantastic in a big way. I highly recommend this cake for your next party or social gathering.
<p> Thanks to Baskin Robbins for making my Valentine's Day deliciously yummy!
<p> I've done a review for FJB in the past, but I can't stay away, I just HAD to do another review. Their jewelry is too pretty to not blog about!
<p> Fantasy Jewelry Box is one of the leading online retailers of celebrity and designer inspired jewelry. Although celebrity inspired jewelry is our specialty, we are also a leading online retailer for replica celebrity rings, fake engagement rings and faux wedding sets.
<p> Our sterling silver jewelry collections primarily consists of high end genuine .925 Sterling Silver with high-quality cubic zirconia stones. We also proudly carry gold jewelry collections as well as fashion jewelry and costume jewelry for our more budget-friendly shoppers. (Taken from website.)
<p> FJB's collection is gorgeous. Whether you like large flashy rings, simple subtle necklaces or bracelets, or delicate earrings, they have you covered. I guarantee 100% you will find something that you will love.
<p> I was sent the Grace Sterling Silver CZ Ring in blue.
<p> Add a splash of class to your wardrobe! This radiant 2 Carat diamond cz cubic zirconia princess cut center stone boasts inlaid clear diamond cz stones around the .925 Sterling Silver band. For extra glamour, this ring has also been dipped in rhodium for the high-end look of platinum. Be sure to look for this style in various sparkling colors!
<p> I love this ring. The only thing that I wish is that it was real! :). The ring is smaller in person. I usually like the stones of my rings to be large, but I actually like the size. There are cubic zirconia chips on the sides of the band, and they sparkle in the light. The stone is a beautiful shade of blue which has a bit of a sparkle too. The ring is created well and fits me well. Once again I am happy with FJB's jewelry!

<p> Water bottles are wasteful to the environment and they are costly too. Wouldn't it be nice to have a reusable, good for the enviroment water bottle that doesn't cost you money in the long run?
<p> New Wave Enviro was established in 1994 with a focus on providing pure, on-demand water at a reasonable price. New Wave Enviro believed in chlorine-free living and litter-free living long before the current media and consumer trends.
<p> New Wave Enviro manufactures and distributes eco friendly products such as reusable water bottles and water filtration systems which produce high quality, inexpensive purified water from your own Tap. Every New Wave Enviro product emphasizes Green Living.
<p> Green Living is not complete without an on demand source of purified water. We manufacture drinking water filters, shower filters, bathtub filters and “on the go” filters for our corn-based reusable water bottle. All of our filters offer on demand “ all you want anytime you want it purified water”.
<p> This company offers stainless steel water bottles in any color or print you could want.
<p> I was sent a 600 ml Flip and Sip silver bottle for my boyfriend, and a floral Flip and Sip bottle for myself.
<p> Features of the Flip and Sip:•Wide mouth improves functionality of the bottle by allowing easier access for ice cubes.•High Flow Sports cap, perfect for on the go hydration: on the field, in the car, at the mall!• Rounded bottom is designed for easier cleaning! •600ml Sports Cap Bottle comes in four stunning colors: Blue, Turquoise, Red, and Natural Brushed Finish. •#304 Food Grade Seriously Safe Stainless®. No hidden liners, just pure safe, eco-friendly Stainless. •Help ease landfill over flow from one time use plastic water bottles, with the last water bottle you'll ever have to buy!
<p> Features of the floral bottle:•Introducing the 600ml Floral Stainless Steel Water bottle in the New Designer Series•#304 Food Grade Seriously Safe Stainless®•As with all of our bottles: BPA Free! No hidden liners or Epoxy Resin•Comes Standard with High Flow Flip N' Sip Cap, our Stainless Steel Cap also fits this bottle•Wide mouth and rounded corners for easy cleaning•Might be the last bottle you'll ever have to buy!
<p> I really like both of these bottles. I've never seen a stainless steel water bottle with a girly design like the floral one. Most bottles are solid colors or have a geometric pattern or something else that seems fit for a male. It's nice that manufacturers are recognizing that woman like to use these bottles too! The colors of the floral bottle are bright and sharp. Both bottles are very durable, easy to drink from, and the flip n sip top is very convenient. The bottles don't leak and they are sturdy and durable. They would be perfect for the gym, the beach, a walk in the park, or maybe even going for a run or a bike ride.

<p> I like my house to smell good at all times. I feel that a house that smells good is inviting, warm, and friendly. I also love delicious smelling body lotions as well. There's nothing better than hydrating yourself with a great smelling lotion.
<p> The pineapple pear smells good enough to eat. The tart smell of the pineapple mixed with the sweet pear smells so good! I spritz it around my living room and family room to freshen things up. I've been told that my house smells great and my friends wanted to know what brand of room spray I'm using. I told them SJ Creations and they were very impressed. Some room sprays are very thick and blanket the room with a thick layer of spray that is hard to handle. The pineapple pear spray is light and the scent is subtle, but there.
<p> The Vanilla Sugar Body Butter The body butter is extremely hydrating and moisturizing which is certainly needed in these cold New York winters. The product smells good has a sweet and girly scent to it. I've used vanilla body butters in the past, so I am used to it. I think vanilla products smell the best. This would be perfect to use after bathing or just whenever your skin gets dry.
<p> SJ Creations is offering my readers a 20% off coupon code off of a purchase of $20 or more. The code is LOVE20.

<p> Just like most people I like sugar and sweet items, but don't like the unhealthy factor of it. Wouldn't it be nice to make your favorite cupcakes but instead of sugar you substitute it with Truvia?
<p> Truvia is a natural sweetener that is refreshingly uncomplicated. Sprinkle it on your grapefruit. Spoon it in your coffee or in your tea.. It won't end up on your conscience or your thighs.One packet of Truvia™ natural sweetener provides the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar.Truvia™ natural sweetener is a great alternative for people with diabetes. It is also kosher certified. (Taken from website.)
<p> I was sent a great Truvia pack featuring a water bottle, recipe booklets, a small Truvia sample and a full-sized box of Truvia sweetener.
<p> I think the concept of Truvia is fabulous. A natural (which is great) 0 calorie sweetener that gives your coffee, tea, and baked goods a sweet little spoonful of love :). I like that one packet of Truvia provides the same level of sweetness as two packets of sugar, but cutting the amount in half. This sweetener doesn't pack a very sweet taste, but a light subtle hint of sweetness. It's enough to satisfy your sweet tooth by not adding calories in your diet. I tried the Truvia in my tea and was impressed. It sweetened my tea but was not overly heavy and sugary.
<p> The recipe booklet was helpful because it provided different recipes that I could use the sweetener in. How would you like a strawberry lemonade cocktail, a blended iced coffee, lemon iced tea, or reduced sugar blueberry muffins? They all sound fabulous to me and provide a great sweetness with no calories.
<p> The water bottle will come in handy during the summer time. I like the shiny metallic green color of the bottle and that it's sturdy and durable too.

<p> I really love Little Debbie. When I'm in the mood for something sweet, but not overly heavy and rich, I turn to them. Their snacks are so delicious, and come in so many varieties, that there's always a snack for everyone's preference.
<p> Little Debbie products are primarily cookie and cake based dessert snacks. They come in dozens of varieties, including the top-selling Swiss Cake Rolls, Nutty Bars, and Oatmeal Creme Pies. Little Debbie products are available in most discount, grocery, and convenience stores, both in boxes and individual wrappings.
<p> I was sent an assortment of Little Debbie products to try. I received Cloud Cakes, Frosted Fudge Cakes, Devil's Squares, and Cosmic Brownies.
<p> I'm going to focus on the Cloud Cakes in this post because that's Little Debbie's newest product. The other delicious and mouth watering snacks have been favorites of mine for years.
<p> The cloud cakes were definitely a little piece of heaven. When you bite into them, you first taste a moist and fluffy sponge cake. The sponge cake is so light and melt in your mouth yummy. Once you get past the first bite, a creamy center of the cake registers on your taste buds. The cream is sweet, fluffy, and just perfect. These cakes are out of this world excellent. The mix of the sponge cake and the cream couldn't be better. Enjoying a Little Debbie snack is very comforting and reminds me of simpler times in my childhood.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES: 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win a case of Cloud Cakes from Little Debbie. The case contains 16 boxes of Cloud Cakes. 2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win Cloud Cakes from Little Debbie. (1 entry)

<p> I've been aware of Amy's for quite a few years now. I've tasted their delicious pizzas and I love that the company is based off of healthy, natural, and organic ingredients.
<p> Amy's Kitchen was founded in 1987, with the purpose of making healthy, organic, and easy-to-prepare frozen food. Owned and run by Andy and Rachel Berliner, Amy's Kitchen took its name from their then-newborn daughter.
<p> The majority of Amy's food products are aimed at vegetarians and vegans, a small but determined focus is also given to people on kosher diets, as well as those who are unable to tolerate ingredients such as wheat gluten, soy, lactose, and maize derivatives.
<p> While most of Amy's wares are frozen, some are not, such as their line of pasta sauces and canned soups. Frozen or not, however, all their products are marketed to people with specialized diets and anyone who considers themselves health-conscious. The organic compound of their product line ranges from 70-95%. None of their products include actual animal meat (i.e., chicken or beef), though some contain animal-derived elements (such as dairy and honey). They do not, however, use eggs in any of their products.
<p> Why should you try Amy's?Amy's made from organic ingredients. Fruits, vegetables and grains are grown organically, the way nature intended food to grow, without the use of insecticides and other harmful chemicals. This benefits the growers, the consumers, and the environment.
<p> Everything is vegetarian. No meat, fish, poultry or eggs are used in any product. Cheeses are made with pasteurized rBST hormone free milk and do not contain animal enzymes or rennet.
<p> You’ll never get bored. We have a large selection of meals! In this section, you will find quickly prepared fast food items from pockets, veggie burgers, pizzas and burritos to complete meals like Country Dinner and Enchilada Whole Meals. Some are gourmet, some just plain “down-home cooking.”
<p> Special Diet? No problem: Amy’s makes several products for people with special dietary restrictions. For those who cannot tolerate wheat, Amy’s offers over 50 no-gluten-added offerings. For the lactose intolerant and those who prefer not to eat dairy, there are more than 50 non-dairy/lactose free, cholesterol free dishes from which to choose.
<p> It’s a family business. Everyone participates, from grandmother to 20-year old Amy, with the family supervising every aspect of the business and taking pride in customer satisfaction. The family tastes all dishes regularly to ensure that each product is of the highest quality.
<p> I was sent four meals to try from the new light and lean line of Amy's. I received Soft Taco Fiesta, Black Bean and Cheese Enchilada, Pasta and Veggies, and Spinach Lasagna.
<p> I tried the spinach lasagna for lunch today. I've never had lasagna without meat, so I was intrigued to see what Amy's lasagna would taste like. I popped it in the microwave and it was done within 4 minutes. The portion size was large for having less than 300 calories, I was surprised. When I think of lasagna, I generally think of a very heavy, but delicious meal. I don't eat it very much because it generally packs a lot of calories. It's a treat to be able to eat and enjoy a delicious meal that is low on calories.
<p> The lasagna had a very light amount of cheese and was filled with a delicious layer of beautiful and green spinach. The noodles were layered generously and on top was a rich, delicious looking marinara sauce. The lasagna was delicious and very filling. I loved the subsitution of meat for spinach, as it is much healthier for you. The lasagna did not taste like a frozen meal, but tasted as if it was just cooked moments before I ate it. It was truly delicious and I did not feel guilty for eating the entire meal because it supplied a low calorie count and provided healthy ingredients with nothing artificial added. The noodles were al dente and perfect, the spinach fresh and tasty, and the marinara sauce warm and comforting. The cheese was warm and melted. I really enjoyed this meal and can't wait to try another selection from the new Light and Lean line. The meals would be perfect for on the go, or just when you want a break from cooking.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win 4 free product coupons to try out meals from Amy's Light and Lean line (each coupon is worth up to $10). A t-shirt in the winner's size will also be included.2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win this Amy's prize pack.. (1 entry)
