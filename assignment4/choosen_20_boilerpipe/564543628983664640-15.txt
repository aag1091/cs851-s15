<p> I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to food. I'm always up for trying foods that I've never tasted before, and finding new favorites. I really love experimenting with old favorite foods and putting a different spin or take on them. It's fun to spice up food.
<p> I haven't tried everything yet but I did try the Mediterranean couscous and 4 bean and barley salad. Two of my favorite food are orzo and edamame, so I was excited to try the bean salad. I liked that the salad had a lot of flavor and taste but was not overdone on the spices. I could lightly taste the sea salt and various spices but they were very subtle. The salad was very fresh and would be perfect to bring to a picnic and serve. It could also make for a nice lunch or snack. The corn and mixed beans had a nice flavor and the edamame had a nice crunchy texture which I enjoyed. I really loved how all of the ingredients came together well and had an awesome 3-dimensional flavor. The dressing was delicious and added a great finishing touch to a delicious and healthy side dish.
<p> The Mediterranean couscous is extremely healthy as well and has key nutritional ingredients in it. It was a little taste of Morocco! The couscous was soft and very fresh and combined nicely with the tomatoes, peppers, and onions. All of the flavors paired together extremely well but still stood out enough for you to find the balance between them. Peppers and onions are a classic combination and go together so well. The lemon and citrus vinaigrette was delicious and extremely fresh and flavorful. I liked how the citrus and lime flavors played off of each other.
<p> I hope to be able to try the other side dishes soon, I'm sure they will be just as delicious as what I've already enjoyed. :)

<p> Since I'm from the south, you know I enjoy a juicy BBQ pulled pork sandwich or a nice rack of ribs from time to time. My boyfriend who is not from the south is totally envious of southern food and would love to indulge in BBQ everyday if given the chance. There's just something about that tangy, smoky, BBQ that is so comforting and satisfying. Thanks to Pig of the Month, you can indulge in restaurant quality BBQ from the comfort of your own home!
<p> Pig of the Month has done a fantastic job of recreating favorite barbecues from different regions. They've decided to make their own perfectly smoked barbecue ribs and lip-smacking sauces—and share the goodness with you! Pig of the Month offers ribs just the way all barbecue lovers want them: perfectly seasoned, tender-on-the-inside but crispy-on-the-outside, smoky, and mouthwatering—just tear-off-the-bones good barbecue. Our smoking technique is one that was perfected over many decades.
<p> This fabulous BBQ company offers pulled pork, desserts, BBQ feasts, a special BBQ deal of the month, baby back ribs, and more. This company is your go-to source for any of your BBQ needs, and they do it deliciously I might add.
<p> Last week I heard a knock at my door. I asked who it was and they replied "Fed-Ex." They really could have replied MOUTH-WATERING BBQ! I knew they held a box which contained fantastic BBQ and I signed for it as fast as I could. I received two racks of Key West style baby back ribs. The ribs came with a special Key West BBQ sauce. YUM! It felt like hours until dinner time rolled around and I could cook these delicious racks of heaven. Lo and behold, dinner time finally came and my stomach was ready to enjoy some fantastic eats. These ribs are infused with the fruits of Florida. They are rubbed with coriander, cumin, and a bit of coffee to get them headed in the right direction. They are then slathered in a sauce like no other you’ve tasted. The sauce consists of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, lemon, and lime to re-create the islands in your very own home. Doesn't that sound mouth-wateringly delicious and unique?
<p> As the BBQ cooked it smelled so delicious and I couldn't wait to eat! I could hardly wait until my ladybug kitchen timer dinged, signifying that I could open the oven door which held a small piece of heaven inside! Finally, it was time to eat! I served the BBQ with steamed broccoli and rolls. What a perfect combination, right?
<p> The BBQ was cooked perfectly! It had a great rustic, smoky smell that combined nicely with the other fruits and spices that it was prepared with. I poured a small amount of sauce on my plate to dip the meat in, and prepared to get my hands messy! The first bite was simply incredible and everything I could want in ribs. The meat was tender, fall off the bone, and so juicy and succulent. It was perfection at its finest. I couldn't believe that I wasn't in a restaurant, but sitting in my kitchen and enjoying such a fantastic meal! The flavor of the meat was out of this world. I've never tasted a BBQ sauce that had such a range of flavors as this one. I would never think to combine fruits into a BBQ sauce but all of the fruits and spices combined excellently together. The sauce has a small kick to it, but the spiciness adds another level of depth and personality. This was seriously the best rack of ribs I've ever tasted and I highly recommend them for your next party, event, or family dinner. How about a final summer BBQ too? Dig in and make your taste buds happy!
<p> One lucky winner will win a 4 sauce sampler package featuring:
<p> 1 bottle Get Lei’d Hawaiian BBQ Sauce
<p> 1 bottle Love Me Tender The King of Memphis BBQ Sauce
<p> 1 bottle Cattle King Texas Brisket &amp; BBQ Sauce
<p> 1 bottle Key West in a Bottle Citrus Grilling Sauce

<p> There's nothing like the scent of Gain laundry detergent. One sniff and you will be magically transformed onto a beautiful tropical island where you'll be sitting beach side with a butler to attend to your every need. Just kidding, but imagine if a smell can do that, what can Gain do to your clothes? :)
<p> Gain offers a variety of laundry care items including: laundry detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets. Gain recently introduced a dish washing liquid as well. There's even Gain with a Febreze scent! Over the past few years, Gain has included new scents in their products such as Spring Awakening, Outdoor Sunshine, Apple Mango Tango, Lavender and more. Every scent will leave your clothes smelling amazing!
<p> I was sent two Gain products for review. I received Gain lavender scented laundry detergent and Gain lavender scented fabric softener.
<p> I did laundry this weekend and used my new fabulously delicious smelling Gain products to make my clothes look and smell terrific. I love the packaging of both bottles, they just instantly make you happy and put you in a cheerful mood.
<p> From the second I unscrewed the laundry detergent cap, the lovely aroma of lavender wafted up and it smelled just amazing! The fabric softener also smelled just as good as the detergent. I poured both the softener and detergent into my washing machine and prepared to let my clothes get happy and enrobe themselves in the wonderful lavender scent.
<p> Once my clothes were done washing, I realized two things. The scent of the lavender actually stayed on my clothes! I've used yummy scented detergents before and the scent didn't transfer to my clothes which disappointed me. Secondly, the softener made my clothes soft and very easy to fold which was a big plus to me. The scent truly lasts too! I wore a shirt today that I washed on Saturday and when I went to put it on this morning, it still smelled like lavender! Wow! That put me in a good mood.
<p> I've been using Gain for years and I love how it's such a stand up product. I've never had any issues or complaints with the brand and I will continue to use them for years to come. Not only does Gain leave my clothes very clean, but also smelling awesome as well. Thanks Gain!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES; 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a bottle of Gain lavender scented fabric softener and lavender scented laundry detergent.

<p> Are you tired of going for a run or exercising and your earbuds just do not stay in your ears? Picture it now, you're running in the park and you've got a great speed going but suddenly your earbuds fall out of your ears. What do you do? You have to stop or slow down and put them back in and that slows your exercise down. How annoying, right?
<p> Yurbuds are ultra-soft earbuds that won't fall out! They have a world-class patented design that complements the human ear while providing exceptional sound quality. I am picky when it comes to headphones. I don't like ones that go over your head as they sometimes get heavy and uncomfortable to wear. Regular earbuds don't always stay in even though they are comfortable to wear.
<p> I was sent a pair of Yurbuds for review. I received a red pair.
<p> These are the fanciest headphones I've ever owned or seen! They are a fun red color which I like. The earbuds are made of a jelly like material and they are extremely comfortable to wear in your ears. The material sort of "molds" to your ear, which is the secret to them staying in. I took these to the gym to use with my ipod. I went running on the treadmill and to my surprise they truly stayed in my ears! I don't mean they slightly fell out or become loose, but they 100% stayed in. I was very impressed! How did I live my life without Yurbuds before? I have no idea. The sound quality is perfect. The earbuds come with a storage case too which is convenient when not using them. Yurbuds would be the perfect gift for the athlete in your life, it will change their exercise experience like never before! It would also be a great gift for any music lover too.

<p> I like to get as many healthy cooking tips as possible. I try to cook healthy on a regular basis but sometimes it's not always possible. I had a great opportunity to ask my questions to a professional chef! I was excited at the opportunity.
<p> With back-to-school right around the corner, stress is added to already-packed schedules. For the busy season ahead, it’s even more important to make time for family dinners each night. Bob Evans can help you find a way to provide quick, convenient solutions so mom and dad don’t have to spend all evening in the kitchen.
<p> Yesterday, chef David Eisel who is the brains behind the Bob Evans Farm foods was available for live interviews. I wasn't available for a live phone interview but I was able to submit my questions in ahead of time.
<p> I asked the following questions: What are your suggestions for making a healthy recipe with not a lot of time? What fresh vegetables are key for optimal nutrition? What's a recipe you have for a delicious dessert that is low in fat and calories but big on taste? What are some good healthier ingredients to substitute in for unhealthier ingredients in recipes?
<p> These are the first questions that came to mind and I knew he would have no trouble answering them. I really enjoyed his answers to my questions and you can watch the whole interview here. It was fun to have the interview personalized to me. I hope you get inspired from it as well! :)
<p> Jewelry is something that I never leave home without. Everyday I wear earrings, rings, and sometimes a necklace or bracelet. I'm always on the lookout for new jewelry when I go shopping because I love to accessorize. My favorite type of jewelry is large, chunky, and dangly. I also enjoy unique pieces that you wouldn't see everyday.
<p> KT Collection is handmade jewelry made with sterling silver &amp; 14-karat gold filled chains. KT's Jewelry is inspired by her travel &amp; the NYC streets. I absolutely love her jewelry, it's so unique and fun and has a great element of style. I've never found a jewelry collection where I've liked so many of the pieces before. If you're looking for a necklace, earrings, or bracelet that is sure to please then you must browse KT Collection. Any of their jewelery would make a perfect gift for a friend or family member or even a bridesmaid!
<p> Here are a few of my favorite earrings:
<p> Aren't they just gorgeous?

<p> I've been using Carmex for about 10 years now. A friend introduced me to the product some time ago and I've been hooked ever since. Carmex is the only product that will truly soothe my chapped winter lips and give them the moisture and hydration that they need. I love that in recent years Carmex has branched out with new products to keep their fans happy.
<p> Carmex is a company which offers different scented and flavored chapsticks dedicated to soothe and protect your lips. They now have even produced a line of skincare, Carmex healing lotion. Whether you prefer original carmex, strawberry, cherry, or mint in a tube or jar, they've got you covered.
<p> Since I'm apart of the Carmex Blog Squad, I frequently get sent items to review. Last week I received a small box and when I saw the Carmex return address label I knew it had to be good!
<p> This is what I saw inside:
<p> I received a Carmex branded very cute picnic blanket, and two Carmex click sticks in the flavors of vanilla and lime.
<p> The click sticks are a truly awesome product and I love the design on the packaging too. They are very convenient for putting in your purse or car for easy reach. Instead of having a tube where you could accidently squeeze out too much and have the product ooze out, you can "click" until you receive the desired amount wanted. You won't waste any either! I love that these click sticks offer SPF 15 and protection from the sun, it's always nice when a product contains sun protection as well. The vanilla smells delicious and good enough to eat! The lime has a nice tart smell to it. Both the vanilla and the lime go on smoothly and are not thick at all, but just the right amount. I can feel the chapstick on my lips throughout the day and I barely have to reapply it. I know that the product is keeping my lips hydrated and properly nourished.
<p> The picnic blanket is perfect for having a last minute summer picnic or a early Fall picnic too. Don't forget that you can also take it to the beach while it's still warm outside. The blanket has a nice colorful pattern on it and it's very soft. It also folds up easily and has a pouch that you can store items in like a cellphone, wallet, etc. It's very roomy too and can fit two people perfectly. I love that I have this because I received a picnic basket through another product review and I can now use my blanket and basket!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES: 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Carmex prize pack featuring a lime and vanilla flavored click stick and a Carmex picnic blanket.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Forget taking your lunch to work or school in a boring old brown paper bag. Who wants to do that? Not me! Using ziploc bags every day is wasteful too. Wouldn't you like to store your lunch in a brightly colored, insulated lunchbox that comes with special containers? I know I would! The containers fit the contents of your lunch perfectly too.

<p> Nothing in life is better than chocolate. There's just something about that sweet, rich, luscious chocolate that can make any bad day instantly melt away. Not to mention how great tasting it is! A fabulous piece of chocolate cake or a sinfully delicious cheesecake brownie is just what you need after a long day.
<p> Pillsbury offers fresh-from-the-oven baked goods that have made mealtimes special times for nearly 140 years. You all know the delicious crescent rolls, sweet cinnamon rolls, and the fabulous oven ready cookies and cake mixes that Pillsbury makes.
<p> Pillsbury has recently added a new product to its fantastic line up, Pillsbury Sweet Moments bite size brownies. I received two bags to try in the flavors of caramel cheesecake and raspberry cheesecake. They were the most delicious brownies that I think I've had in a very long time.
<p> Raspberry Cheesecake Brownie Bites:
<p> These cheesecake bites are bite-sized pieces of heaven. They are so incredibly delicious and honestly I ate more than I should have! On the outside there is a great chocolate shell with a pretty pattern etched on the top. These are best served cold so you can enjoy all of the flavors at once at the peak of its perfection. Upon biting into the square of chocolate that holds the key to my heart, this is what you see;
<p> I love how each layer is distinct. First the creamy cheesecake followed by the tart raspberry layer, completed by a fabulous layer of fluffy chocolate. Each layer has its own distinctive taste and is not masked by the other flavors. You can taste each flavor equally. The cheesecake is rich, creamy and full of flavor. That's the first flavor I noticed when I bit into the brownie bite. Soon after the sweet raspberry layer blanketed my taste buds in raspberry bliss. Instantly after that I tasted the sweet and fabulous chocolate. All of the flavors combined together to produce a simply fantastic treat. I don't normally like raspberry filled sweets, but this was out of this world. These treats would be great paired with a glass of your favorite wine.
<p> Caramel Cheesecake Brownie Bites:
<p> I swear, Pillsbury had me in mind when creating this flavor. Anything caramel flavored is always near and dear to my heart. These have the same pretty design etched on the top of the brownie and have the same 3 layers inside like the raspberry brownie bites, except the raspberry is replaced by caramel. When I bit into the sweet treat, this is what I saw:
<p> Isn't that just perfection at its finest? This cool and creamy treat was just simply amazing. In my opinion, the colder the cheesecake it is, the better it tastes. The chill just brings out the taste more I think. When I bit into the treat, fireworks went off in my mouth! I tasted the fluffy cheesecake layer first which was followed by a sweet and decadent caramel layer. The caramel layer was ooey, gooey, sweet and just perfect. The caramel would have been awesome on its own but paired with a cheesecake layer and a chocolate layer? I could now die happy! The cheesecake paired fabulously with the fantastic caramel layer. Lastly, the chocolate layer joined the sweet fest. I couldn't believe how delicious this square piece of heaven was. I certainly could have eaten the entire bag at once but I had to control myself. Pair this confectionery treat with a delicious cup of steaming coffee and it will be the right way to end your day.
