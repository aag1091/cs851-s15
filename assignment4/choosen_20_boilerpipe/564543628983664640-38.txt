<p> In my opinion, chocolate truly cures everything. The sweet, creamy treat can do no wrong in my eyes! There's nothing like a fantastic chocolate bar to satisfy that sweet tooth. I don't discriminate against chocolate. I enjoy it in brownies, cookies, pies and more. Maybe I'll even have a piece today! :)
<p> La Bella Gift Baskets offers beautiful gift baskets for practically any occasion. Treat your family to a gorgeous snack basket for Christmas. LaBella offers themed gift baskets along with baskets designed for men or women. Whatever your needs are, LaBella has the right basket just for you.
<p> LaBella's baskets are perfect for letting loved ones know that you're thinking of them. Surprise them with a candles gift basket or a meat and cheese one!
<p> I recently did a giveaway for LaBella, but I knew the baskets were too good to just do a giveaway. I had to do a review too!
<p> I browsed the baskets, my eyes growing larger with excitement each basket I saw. I finally settled on the large chocolate gift basket. This basket is what chocolate dreams are made of!
<p> The basket is beautiful. I know what you're asking though, you want to know what's inside, right? I'll tell you:
<p> The treats come packed into a nice basket that I could easily reuse after the yummies are gone. Obviously there is so much chocolate that I can't try everything at once. I have tried the chocolate brownies and the chocolate peanut butter delight. Once you take a bite of the brownie, you're on the fast track to chocolate town USA. The brownie is soft, moist and full of delicious chocolate flavor. It is firm, but chewy at the same time. It's not incredibly rich and sweet, but is sweet enough for me.
<p> The chocolate peanut butter delight was also excellent. I love chocolate combined with peanut butter, it's a delicious combination that you can't go wrong with. The peanut butter is creamy, and full of nutty flavor. The chocolate is sweet and delicious and lovingly wraps itself around the peanut butter for a fantastic treat.
<p> These two goodies are best served with a tall glass of ice cold milk. I can't wait to try the rest of the chocolate, I know I'll love everything.
<p> If you're looking to treat a friend or a relative to something decadent, this basket would be the perfect choice. Maybe they'll even share with you!

<p> I believe that humor is a necessary part of daily life. If there wasn't humor, life would truly be boring and mundane. It's important to not take yourself seriously and make sure that you laugh at the small things.
<p> You all might know Sarah Colonna as one of the writers and roundtable stars of Chelsea Lately, which is one of my favorite shows. Her witty, yet frank stories and skits are always entertaining, and she brings an added element of fun to the show. I've been a long time fan of hers and always enjoy seeing what hilarious thing she will do or say next!
<p> Sarah recently published a biography called Life As I Blow It. The hilarious memoir highlights growing up in the south (which I can relate to), moving to LA to pursue big dreams, her dating life, and trying to find normalcy while just wanting to have fun. The book has you sympathizing with Sarah when she breaks up with one of her boyfriends, and then simultaneously has you laughing while trying to get out of an awkward situation. The stories go in chronological order of her life and each one is funnier than the next. All of the content flows well together and is truly written from the heart.
<p> What Sarah does that sets her apart from other authors is that she doesn't attempt to sugarcoat her life. She can admit her regrets and what she is and isn't proud of, instead of hiding it. That to me makes a good writer that I can identify with.
<p> This book was a very quick read for me. I couldn't put it down and I finished it in only two days. I was actually annoyed when I finished it because I wanted more! Any book that makes me laugh ranks high on my list.
<p> If you're looking for a comedic book that will keep you entertained until the very last page, I highly recommend Life As You Blow It. You won't regret it!
<p> Sarah's currently on tour for her book. Click here to see if she's coming to a city near you.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TWO (2) winners for this contest. Two winners will win a personalized (to them) signed copy of Life As I Blow It.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Cuisinart has been one of my favorite cooking appliance brands for years. The products are quality made and yield wonderful results. Cuisinart's products cover the prep work for you. Why stand at the kitchen counter chopping carrots and celery when you don't have to? I've been needing to introduce a food processor into my life for quite some time. I'm happy to say the food processor and myself are now a match made in heaven!
<p> The prestigious Cuisinart brand is not limited to food processors. Plugged or unplugged, nobody covers the kitchen like Cuisinart. The company is a full-service culinary resource with a wide array of products, preferred by chefs and favored by consumers. Cuisinart offers kitchen appliances such as toasters, waffle makers, blenders, food choppers and food processors, deep fryers, coffee makers, microwaves, and much more. Cuisinart's beautiful range of products will keep your kitchen running properly.
<p> My favorite thing about Cuisinart products is how beautiful they are. The sleek, stainless steel exterior is gorgeous and very attractive. The appliances are built to last for years, which is an added bonus. I had reviewed a Cuisinart breadmaker a few months back and knew that I had to come back and review something else. Cuisinart is too good to ignore!
<p> I've been wanting a food processor for some time. This essential cooking tool makes prep work much easier and takes the hardwork out of cooking. When I contacted Cuisinart and they agreed to send me one, I was very excited! Images of julienned carrots and perfect thinly sliced cucumbers danced in my head.
<p> I received the Cuisinart Elite Collection 12 Cup Food Processor.I can't believe this beauty is mine!
<p> Product Specs:Offering home chefs with more options than ever, this next-generation food processor from Cuisinart is destined for culinary greatness. It comes fully equipped with two interchangeable bowls, plus an adjustable, 6-position slicing disc that ensures results exactly as you intended.
<p> Firstly, I love the design of the food processor. The sleek, chunky design with large push buttons is very modern! Not to mention that I love that it's silver and easily matches with my other small appliances. The device is large so I suggest that you have room for it before considering purchasing it. I have a small kitchen but luckily have just enough room for it. The unit came with a how-to DVD and a recipe book which was really helpful. The recipe book has a lot of great ideas in that I can't wait to start making like various dips and of course guacamole! The DVD does a great job of explaining how the device works and what you can get out of it. It's definitely a DVD you should watch if you aren't 100% sure of how to use a food processor.
<p> I love the various blades and slicing discs that are interchangable depending on what your food needs are. Be careful of the blades and discs though, they are very sharp. A food processor is perfect for making "restaurant style" vegetable presentations, if desired. It's easy to wow guests when Cuisinart does all of the hard work for you!
<p> I decided to start off small and make some thinly sliced carrots. The unit is very easy to put together and the instructions are clear. In no time I had the FP set up and running. It's not a very loud device either, which is great. You feed the peeled carrots through the feeding tube and instantly you have beautifully sliced carrots which will add pizazz to any salad.
<p> There's so many different uses for this food processor that it will surely revolutionize your kitchen and prep time. I know I can't wait to use it more. This necessary kitchen tool would be the perfect gift for a budding chef or that resident foodie that you know. Why not treat yourself too?
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Cuisinart for providing me with the complimentary food processor in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Since I cook a lot, I'm always looking for more ways to give my food that extra boost of flavor. I love to cook delicious, flavorful meals. Sure, seasonings are nice, but if you over season the food it can turn out horrible. Having something that can give your food that extra pizazz without worry is great!
<p> Char Crust dry rub seasonings create a sizzling seared crust, bursting with juicy flavor. You can use Char Crust dry rub on any meat or fish, even vegetables.
<p> Can't you just imagine your favorite meals cooked with a fabulous, juicy crust? My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
<p> As you can see, there's a flavor for any one's taste. All American BBQ and original hickory grilled sound best to me. I regularly season my veggies with garlic powder, so I'd love to try the roasted garlic peppercorn. It sounds fantastic!
<p> What looks best to you? You have to decide soon because one lucky winner will win four boxes of their choice!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win four boxes of their choice of Char Crusts.

<p> This is post #5 for Kiddie Academy. I had never thought about opening a franchise, but this is something that is working well for people, especially Wendy Barry!
<p> Wendy Barry opened her Kiddie Academy franchise on March 15, 1993 at 100 Kiddie Lane, Elkton, MD, at the age of 35. Wendy’s tenure with the company is a true testament to her dedication to superior child care and success within the local community. Her focus on education has proven that the Kiddie Academy’s child care model is not a typical day care.
<p> Background: As its first franchisee, Wendy Barry has a long, rich history with Kiddie Academy. Prior to becoming a franchisee, she spent 10 years as a special education teacher at Elkton High School in Elkton, MD. Wendy began looking into a child care franchise after the birth of her daughter, Taylor. After reading an article in her local paper about the Millers, who were looking to begin franchising their child care company, Wendy arranged a meeting to discuss the possibility of becoming a franchisee. The Millers’ educational philosophy matched hers, and she was impressed by the overall business. She automatically knew Kiddie Academy was the right fit for her -- both professionally and personally.
<p> Goals: With a strong background in education, Wendy is continually focused on achieving the highest educational standards. She has just become MSDE approved for her four-year-old program and is currently working to achieve the MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) Early Childhood Accreditation. As a successful franchisee, Wendy also looks to continually build her enrollment and rapport with her current families and the local community.
<p> Challenges: Being the first Kiddie Academy franchisee has its advantages, but it also presented a challenge for Wendy when opening her location. With no other academies in the area, she was faced with a lack of brand awareness and peer support that future franchisees would benefit from. However, her status as the only franchisee offered her the ability to have the corporate staff’s undivided attention and assistance. With that, and her hard work and dedication, she was able to overcome all challenges.
<p> Results: Wendy is thrilled at how her business has grown and progressed. For the last 17 years, she has provided a safe environment for children to learn and a place that parents can rely on for the care of their children. She receives positive feedback from her families and enjoys a terrific reputation within the community. Wendy and her academy have won numerous awards and accolades, including: Brand Champion Award, #1 Child Care in Cecil County for 2009 and 2010, and the 2010 Director of the Year Award. She also takes pride in knowing she has offered her employees a work place that has helped achieve their career goals.

<p> Wearing makeup is a part of my daily life. I couldn't imagine not including it in my beauty routine. I love to experiment with new colors and shades, not to mention it's a lot of fun. Who doesn't want to change up their look every so often? It's important to express yourself and makeup is the perfect medium for doing so.
<p> Laura Mercier is a world-renowned makeup artist and creator of Laura Mercier cosmetics, skincare, body &amp; bath, and fragrance. The Laura Mercier philosophy revolves around the flawless face - the concept that making skin look perfect is the first and foremost important thing a woman can do to achieve a great look. Laura believes that a flawless look begins with a fresh canvas, and each product has been specially developed to allow every woman to achieve an incredibly even, smooth, natural-looking complexion.
<p> Laura Mercier creates products to make your skin radiant and beautiful. Whether you're looking for foundation, blush, tinted moisturizer and more, they have you covered.
<p> My main concern is wanting my skin to look as best as possible. I'm always searching for that product to give me flawless skin. When I stumbled upon Laura Mercier's foundation primer, it sounded like just the thing that my skin needed.
<p> This lightweight, water-based primer creates a smooth, invisible layer that acts as a buffer between the skin and makeup. Specialized for oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin types, its high water content soothes surface dehydration around active blemishes.
<p> The primer comes in a decent sized tube and there is a lot of product in it. I used it on clean, washed skin and then put my foundation on top of it. It easily comes out and looks like liquid foundation. The light-weight primer easily and smoothly rubs into my skin with no problem. It matched my skin tone perfectly too. I instantly noticed that my skin looked different and better once I applied it, even with no foundation on! Once I put my foundation on top of it I really noticed the difference. I really think it improved the quality of my skin. It made my makeup look flawless and last longer. I really liked the way it made me look. I didn't notice any irritants or issues developing on my face when I wear the primer. This is the perfect primer for guaranteeing a fabulous look for any face!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Laura Mercier for providing me with this complimentary foundation primer in exchange for the review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Once I find a brand that I like, I am loyal to that brand for years. I like to find new brand favorites of course, but there are certain products that I only buy from the brand I am loyal to. I've been a long-time fan of Kraft cheeses and snack products for years. They are one of the only cheese brands I will buy. I trust Kraft for quality, taste, and price. Kraft has stood the test of time and has been popular for many, many years. There's a reason why.
<p> Kraft is a global snacks powerhouse with an unrivaled portfolio of brands people love. They market crackers, confectionery treats, beverages, cheeses, grocery products, and convenient meals in approxmiately 170 countries. Most people don't realize that Kraft makes more than just cheese and macaroni and cheese.
<p> When I heard that Kraft had recently introduced a line of milk and granola bars, I knew I wanted to try them. Kraft MilkBite milk and granola bars are made with real milk and calcium, making them an excellent source of calcium with 30% of the daily recommended value. They are a great source of vitamin D and fiber, include 5g of protein, 7g of whole grains, and no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. They do need to be kept refrigerated though. The bars come in five delicious flavors-chocolate, strawberry, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, and mixed berry. Each box contains five bars. A flavor everyone's taste buds!
<p> I was sent two boxes of Kraft bars to review, chocolate and strawberry. The bars came in a cute Kraft lunchbag too! I'm a big fan of most granola bars, so I had a good feeling that I would like these.
<p> I tried the chocolate one first, of course. :) The bar is a small rectangular sized treat. It has chocolate chips inside and on the top and was drizzled with beautiful chocolate on top. The bar was thicker and denser than most granola bars than I am used to, which I liked. The snack was chewy, fresh, and full of great granola and chocolate taste. The chocolate flavor was prevalent, but not overly sweet. I enjoyed that the bar was cold, it was refreshing. It would be the perfect cool treat on a hot summer's day too. The bar would also be a nice, healthy snack to throw in a lunchbox or for a mid-day pick-me-up. I like that it has whole grain and protein benefits. I'm all for anything that tastes great and has health benefits too.
<p> The strawberry was very enjoyable as well. The size of the bar was the same size as the chocolate one. The bar had white icing drizzled generously on the top. There were chunks of strawberries on top and inside. The strawberry chunks were large and full of flavor. The flavor of strawberry was noticeable and the treat was very fresh. Each bite was packed with an equal amount of strawberry chunks and granola. In my opinion this bar was a little sweeter than the chocolate, but not so overly sweet. This would be a great snack to keep in your fridge at work if you need a sweet treat during the day. It's also equally as perfect to throw in a child's lunchbox for school. Keep an icepack in there to keep it cold though.
<p> Each bar contains 140 calories which isn't terrible, but remember it's not an extremely low-calorie snack.
<p> I've enjoyed the bars that I've tried so far and I look forward to trying the other MilkBite flavors!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Kraft for providing me with the complimentary package to review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I've been a long time fan of Burt's Bees for years. I love their quality, natural products that provide wonderful results. When I heard that they had a new line extension, I was very excited! These products are definitely not to be missed!
<p> Gud is a natural product line that features body lotions, body butters, body washes, shampoo's, conditioners, and more! Nothing is tested on animals and the products have no chemicals or parabans. The packaging is adorable and features bright, cheery flowers. The scents range from Vanilla Flame, Pearanormal, the sweet Floral Cherrynova; and Orange Petalooza. Each scent has a package of products. Regardless of what scent you choose, Gud will leave your skin and hair feeling soft and moisturized. Don't worry, there's enough Gud to go around. :)
<p> Natural products are important to me. I don't like to use anything that has a lot of chemicals or additives in it. Why expose yourself to those ingredients when you don't have to?
<p> Here's some examples of the products featured:
<p> Orange Petalooza Shampoo

<p> Have you ever been to an ice cream shop and none of the flavors really stood out to you. Sure you have the typical vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, etc, but you want something really unique and different. Let's say you want something like nutella marshmallow. It sounds delicious but most ice cream shops won't sell a flavor like that. With an ice cream maker all of your fantastic sweet treat ideas and dreams can now come true!
<p> White Mountain Products was founded in 1853. They've always been about making good times happen right at home; with ice cream you make yourself. The experience starts with the discussion—often the kids get their pick—of what flavor ice cream your family wants to make. Vanilla with bittersweet chocolate chips or maybe peach made with orchard fresh peaches. Every delicious choice is limited only by your imagination. Just set up your White Mountain® Electric Ice Cream Maker with ice and rock salt, and let the fun begin. Whether you're cooling off a hot summer picnic or warming up a homebound winter weekend, the experience is one you can't put a price on.
<p> Just imagine it now! Do you want banana with chocolate chips? Done! How about strawberry with blueberry chunks in it? You bet! Even green tea ice cream can be made. The possibilities are endless. The best part is that you'll be making it right at home!
<p> You'll be very popular when you serve ice cream made from your new ice cream maker at your next party, or even BBQ in the summer! It's also great family fun to make ice cream with your children. They'll love spending time with you and creating their own tasty treat.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 4 quart electric ice cream maker from White Mountain Products.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me what what the first flavor of ice cream you would make with your new ice cream maker would be.(1 entry)
