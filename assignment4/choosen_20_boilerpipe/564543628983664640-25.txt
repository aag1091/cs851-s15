Furniture Fix would be great to save it a trip from Couch Heaven.

<p> Last week I had the pleasure of attending an Ivory soap media party. The party was for Ivory's new campaign which hadn't been updated in 125 years! The event was also to announce the new spokesmom which was Melissa McCarthy. It was a fabulous introduction into Ivory's new focus.
<p> Ivory's target audience is mostly moms and women and I enjoyed hearing how moms trust Ivory for their children and it's a lifelong brand choice. Ivory's new commercials and ad campaign are fun and whimsical and really get their message across perfectly.
<p> The party was a lot of fun and I appreciated the opportunity to be invited. I always love a good party! I know a lot of my readers are moms and I'm sure they use Ivory soap in their house. I'd love to hear how long you've been a loyal consumer.
<p> Melissa is a great spokesmom for the brand. She is fun, funny, and very honest. It's just what Ivory needs!
<p> Here's some pictures from the event.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* I was not compensated for this post. I was invited to the event and all thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> I have a bathroom full of beauty products that I use on a regular basis. I know most women can agree with that statement. Most men on the other hand barely use any cosmetic products. I think it's time for men to have more of a meauty (man beauty) routine! They should use products that they like, that provide good results, and also smell great too!
<p> EO Products was founded in 1995 and is the nation's leading brand of pure and natural personal care products. The products are created using the highest grade natural and certified organic ingredients. Each product is guaranteed to be natural, gentle, effective and free from animal testing. They have products for men, women, and even pets! Whether you're looking for a great shampoo for your boyfriend, a delicious smelling rose and chamomile handmade soap bar for yourself, or even natural shampoo for your dog, they have it all! A gift certificate would be the perfect birthday gift for any beauty junkie!
<p> Jay was really happy when the package came. All of the products were packaged very nicely in a gift basket. He was looking forward to using the products. All of the products have great, clean packaging. The labels are easy to read and outline clearly what each product is.
<p> The rosemary and mint shampoo smelled very clean and refreshing. He said he could immediately smell the mint when he washed his hair and the shampoo lathered up nicely and easily rinsed away. The essence of rosemary was very subtle but pleasant. The conditioner was easy to apply to his hair and applied smoothly. It rinsed away effortlessly and he was left with fabulously cleansed hair that smelled great!
<p> I really like the scent of mint and I'm glad so many of these products accompany that scent. The shower gel was grapefruit and mint which is an interesting combination. It smelled very pleasant and the scent of grapefruit and mint lingered long after the shower was over. The body wash lathered up nicely and rinsed away cleanly. Jay said the body wash had a "cooling" element to it.
<p> The body lotion was also mint and grapefruit scented. It was my boyfriend's favorite product by far. It easily came out of the pump and was easy to rub into hands, arms, and any other dry areas. The lotion was non-greasy and rubbed in well. The combination of mint and grapefruit is an exotic combination but it really paired well together. You can differentiate the two scents, they don't mask each other out. The lotion left a pleasant scent behind even hours after applying! The body lotion would be perfect to use in the winter on dry legs and ankles and hands. It provides good moisturization and hydration to dry skin.
<p> The teatree and lemon shave foam was great too. Tea tree has many benefits that are great for your skin. The shave foam pumped out easily and provided a great foam that was easy to shave away. The lemon scent smelled great and afterwards Jay was left with a very smooth face. He said he would definitely use this foam everytime he shaved and that it was a truly great product.
<p> Lastly, the teatree and lemongrass bar soap was used. The bar itself smelled great even before he used it! The scents of lemongrass and teatree together are a great combination. The soap lathered up nicely and easily and was easy to rinse off. It didn't feel sticky after rinsing off and no soap residue was left behind. Jay said he felt very clean after using the soap and liked the way it cleansed. He liked the subtle scent too!
<p> Looks like you have a new loyal customer, EO!

<p> I think it's important to have an element of flair and style to your hair. If you're putting it up in a ponytail or a pretty updo, you don't want to use just a simple colored hair tie or some plain bobby pins, right? Add some pizzaz!
<p> Scunci (pronounced skuncee) was built on entrepreneurial spirit powered by innovative thinking. Long respected as the leader in fashion hair accessories, scünci® operated as a privately held company until its acquisition in March of 2005 by Conair Corporation, a worldwide leader in professional and consumer hair appliances.
<p> Scunci has recently released its newest hair product, the Linziclip.
<p> The Linziclip is as simple to use as your go-to claw clips, but with a cleaner, more polished look! Like a claw clip, springs and “teeth” are used to grip the hair tightly, but they are hidden within a sleek cylinder exterior that comes in a variety of sizes, colors, designs and finishes. Its unique flat bottom design allows for a firm, yet comfortable hold (feel free to lay your head back), while the hinges are placed discreetly on the sides of the clip – no more “butterfly” wings on top of the clip! unique flat clip.
<p> Perfect for any daytime or nighttime occasion, Linziclips can be used for ponytails, updos, half-up/half-down styles and more. Use them to spice up your holiday outfit or give them as great stocking stuffer gifts.
<p> The Linziclip® by Scünci® is available in mini, “midi” and “maxi” sizes for prices ranging from $3.99 to $5.99 at drug and mass retailers nationwide.
<p> This clip is perfect any event, night or day. Create beautiful hair styles in a matter of seconds that stay up securely and comfortably. I like that the springs are hidden and the clip has a flat bottom which allows for a great, all day hold. Choose your size depending on what your hair needs are. Thanks to Scunci, you'll always be stylish!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:
<p> 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Linziclip in their size of choice.

<p> I browsed the website and found out there were so many items and clothes that I liked. I finally settled on the linen and organic cotton jersey sweater. I was instantly drawn to it as it's something I would wear in a heartbeat.Their lightweight linen-cotton cardigan is the epitome of eco-conscious style. Ideal for layering, the cardigan has ½" brass rivets at the collar and zippers on the front pockets for added interest and appeal.
<p> This sweater is great! It would look perfect with a white long-sleeved t-shirt underneath, skinny jeans, and black boots or flats. The sweater fits me perfectly and is just the right length, it's not too long and not too short. The sleeves are not too long either. It keeps me warm and is a great piece for a trendy Fall look. It's comfortable to wear too. The color is a nice rich black which I like, it can be paired with many colors since black goes with practically everything. The sweater is great for wearing right now, while it's still not freezing cold since it's a lightweight material. The brass rivets on the top and zippers on the front pocket add extra style and an element of fun to the sweater. The sweater is work appropriate and transfers over to being night-friendly too! I love that it's a versatile piece. Thanks to Gaiam, I'm another satisfied customer!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Gaiam for providing me with a complimentary sweater in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I love to redecorate. It's fun to change up a room with a brand new coffee table, couch, or even rug. Your style can change over the years and you should always change the decor accordingly. There's nothing like making a room look brand new and stylish.
<p> Mohawk Home is the largest manufacturer of area rugs, indoor and outdoor mats, and washable rugs in the United States. Mohawk has any type of rug to fit your style and needs. Whether you're looking for a Persian style accent rug for your family room or a new bath rug for your bathroom, they have you covered. The rugs are beautiful, of high quality, and built to last.
<p> I always love to add new accents or accessories to my house. When I had the opportunity to review a rug, I jumped at the chance. My old rug was in need of an upgrade. I went to mail a package and when I came back the rug was delivered and I was very surprised! I wasn't expecting it so soon. My boyfriend was excited to have a new rug, as was I.
<p> This is the current rug I had underneath my coffee table. I like it but it's small for the room it's in.
<p> I browsed the rugs available and I spent my time making a decision. It was fun to see all of the gorgeous rugs. I finally settled on the 8x10 Multicolor Select Strata rug.
<p> Here's my living room with the new rug!
<p> I absolutely love this rug! It fits in my living room perfectly and I couldn't have asked for a better size either. It covers up a decent amount of hardwood where as before my old rug was not large enough. I had to put some of the rug underneath my couch and my kitchen table though. I love the rich espresso background paired with the gorgeous multi-colored circles. The colors of the circle are warm and muted, which I like. I wouldn't like a loud, bright rug. The pattern of the rug is fun and funky and just my style. The rug colors actually match the exact colors of a painting that I have hanging above my couch, which is great! The rug is of high quality and comfortable to walk on too. It's funny how adding a new piece of furniture or a rug can really brighten up a room and make it look bigger. Thanks Mohawk Home for giving my living room some much needed new pizazz!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Mohawk Home rug of their choice valued up to $400. Please use this link to view the rugs. http://www.mohawkhome.com/products.aspx

<p> Thanksgiving is just around the corner. It's important that you practice safe food handling and preparation when making holiday meals. It's easy to do too many tasks at once and not properly wash your hands or clean your work space, but it's essential that you take proper precauction. Whenever you're preparing anything, make sure public health and safety standards are followed.
<p> NSF International is a nonprofit organization that is committed to protecting public health and safety by developing standards and certifying products against those standards.
<p> To help better educate consumers and prevent incidences of holiday food poisoning, NSF International has put together a list of top food safety tips.
<p> Tip #1 Shop SafelyWhen purchasing food for your holiday dinner, always shop for cold and ready-to-eat foods last right before checkout. Avoid foods where the packaging has been damaged. If ordering food for delivery, make sure someone is home to receive the food and that it is delivered cold.
<p> Tip #2: Thaw Frozen Items ProperlyFrozen foods should never be thawed at room temperature. Wrapped frozen items can be safely thawed in the refrigerator or under cold water. You can also use a microwave if you plan to finish cooking the food right away. Many frozen foods can be cooked from the frozen state, although additional cooking time will be needed.
<p> Tip #3: Avoid Cross ContaminationNever use the same utensils or cutting boards for both raw and ready-to-eat foods unless they are thoroughly washed with hot soapy water between each use.
<p> Tip #4: Wash Hands OftenThe best thing we can do to not only limit cross contamination but to reduce the spread of illness is to wash our hands – frequently and often. Hands should be washed with warm water and soap for 20 seconds before and after handling any raw foods.
<p> Tip #5: Disinfect Countertops &amp; SinksIn addition to washing utensils and other food preparation equipment between each use, counter-top surfaces and sinks need to be regularly washed and sanitized as well.
<p> Tip #6: Keep Hot Foods Hot, Cold Foods ColdPerishable foods need to be kept out of the danger zone – between 40 F and 140 F. Cold foods should be kept refrigerated until just before serving, and then placed on a bed of ice. Hot foods should be kept in the oven or on a warmer.
<p> Tip #7: Remember the Two Hour RuleNever let perishable foods sit out at room temperature for more than two hours (one hour if the temperature exceeds 90 F).
<p> Tip #8: Store Leftovers SafelyLarge quantities of leftovers should be placed in smaller containers in the refrigerator to facilitate cooling. Leftovers can be frozen. If refrigerated, they should be consumed within 3 – 4 days or discarded.
<p> To help get you into the holiday cooking spirit, NSF wants to give one lucky winner a prize pack featuring:(NSF Certified) Turkey Roasting Pan(NSF Certified) Meat Thermometer(NSF Certified) TupperwareMatching Dishcloth and Kitchen Towel Set
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win an NSF prize pack.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> There are such classic food combinations in this world. Some favorites that come to mind are hamburgers and french fries, spaghetti and meatballs, and cake and ice cream. Whenever you find two new items that you like, I feel it's always best to combine them together (to an extent!) Cakedy shares my philosophy.
<p> Cakedy is any candy bar and cake lover's dream come true. They are based out of Minneosta but are making everyone's taste buds happy around the world. The sweet treat is a unique blend of your favorite homemade cake whipped into a nougat and covered in a rich candy bar shell. The treats are offered in the following flavors: Don't all of these flavors look simply fabulous? I was sent a mix of bars for review but I've only tried one so far, the vanocolate. The bar is not a perfect rectangle, but a delicious sort of rounded mass of beautiful, sweet chocolate. The confectionary treat smelled amazing and I couldn't wait to try it.
<p> When you take that first bite, you bite down into a crunchy, sweet chocolate shell which is followed by moist, fluffy cake. The cake was excellent and very light, but still thick enough to be noticed. The cake had a great flavor which I couldn't get enough of! In between the cake and the chocolate was vanilla frosting nougat. This gave the treat such incredible depth and not to mention that it was fantastic! It was sweet, creamy, and rich. The cake, frosting, and chocolate all combined together so well. This was truly the best candy bar I've had in a while and I absolutely loved it!I look forward to trying the other flavors soon. If you're in the mood for a fabulous sweet treat, I urge you to try Cakedy. You will not regret it. By the way, don't offer to share with anyone else either!
