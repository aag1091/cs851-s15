<p> I like to keep a very organized home. All of my clothes and shoes are neatly put away in the closet, my linen closet has everything meticulously folded, and my kitchen cabinets have all the cans and boxes lined up nicely. It can be frustrating to keep items organized if you don't have a lot of kitchen cabinets, which I don't. It's always been an uphill battle not to have items eventually become unorganized. I depend on racks and organizational tools to help me achieve that.
<p> SpiceStack helps turn your jumbled spice mess into an organized success. The unit fits in all standard-sized kitchen cabinets and features three horizontal drawers for easy location, retrieval and return of store-bought spices. You simply pull the drawer out until it's extended and lower it to resting position at eye-level. Because all the labels face out, it's easy to select the spice of your choice. You save time searching for spices while cooking meals and preparing your shopping list. It also saves money because you're not buying duplicates of spices you already have. It's available in two sizes: the original which holds 18 full-sizes or 36 half-size spice bottles.
<p> This is an absolutely fabulous tool. I cook a lot and have many spices in the kitchen. I'm always fumbling in the back of my cabinet to find the exact spice I need. I tend to pick out the wrong one because other food items are blocking the labels. I used to line up the spices in the front of the cabinet, but then it blocked other food items and eventually everything would become unorganized. I've always wished for a product to help me, and now the organization gods have spoken!
<p> The SpiceStack fits neatly in my cabinet (which luckily is very wide.) It allows me to save space and still have room to store other food. The unit is white which is neutral and fits in with anything you might have. No assembly is required with the product and the rubber feet keep it securely in place inside your cabinet. I put my spice bottles into each row and I loved how each one fit properly and I was easily able to view the label. You can even put certain bottles on each row for easy access. For example, the spices that you use the most can go on the first row, so you always know where they are.
<p> I first used the SpiceStack last night when I was cooking. I needed a bottle of seasoned salt in this recipe. I slid the first row and pulled it down and I loved what I saw staring back at me. My spices were facing front and easily viewable. Everything was at eye level and I did not need to fumble through the cabinets while the food was cooking. I didn't even have to stop cooking the chicken! With my free hand I could grab the spice, I thought this was truly fantastic.
<p> The SpiceStack is here to make your life easier and less hectic in the kitchen. For that I am very grateful. When your items are organized, you feel better. I know I do. This would be a great gift for someone who just moved into a new apartment or house, or that budding chef in your family who's always cooking. Let SpiceStack help you turn your kitchen cabinet into an organized dream!

<p> I love anything to do with interior decorating. I'm constantly picking out new pieces of artwork for my apartment, or updating accent pieces. I love to watch HGTV too. There's nothing like having a new piece of art on the wall. It makes the room come alive and bring warmth and conversation to it. Do you know what makes an ordinary piece of art stand out? The answer to that question would be a canvas on your wall that you custom designed from a picture that you took. That is extra special.
<p> Canvas4Life is an exciting and innovative company giving people worldwide the ability to transform their digital photos into amazing canvas art prints. Their mission is to provide great custom wall art, at affordable prices, to every home around the world. There is no canvas art print that they cannot create. Simply upload your photo onto their website and they do the rest. They print just about any sized photo on high-quality, 100% cotton canvas. Each print is gallery wrapped on professional stretcher bars and you even get to choose from many free creative options, like their Andy Warhol effect, as well as special cropping and other advanced edit.
<p> A beautiful canvas displaying a picture of your family would be a great addition to a family room or living room. Capture your memories and enjoy them through a beautiful piece of art on your wall.
<p> I had the opportunity to create my own canvas for review purposes. Since I am moving next month, it couldn't have come at a better time since I can hang it up in my new apartment. I spent some time deciding what I would like. I didn't know if I wanted a picture of the beach, flowers that I took, or what. I love photography and am constantly taking pictures, so I had a lot to choose from. I finally settled on a gorgeous picture of Manhattan that I took a few months back. I took the picture at night and I really loved the way it came out. I knew it would be perfect to choose.
<p> The canvas came very quickly, within a few days. It was packaged very carefully and bubble wrapped well. The canvas is a 16x20 which is a great size for any wall.
<p> I took this picture when I was standing on a bridge, which is how I achieved that angle. I instagramed it, which I tend to do to most pictures I take. I love when photos have a vintage feel to them. It really appeals to me and makes the pictures look like they are from a different era.
<p> The canvas is created very well. It's solidly made and is of high quality. The back of the canvas has an area for you to hang up on the wall, which makes things a lot easier. I can't wait to hang this up in my new apt, it will look great!
<p> Ordering a canvas would be a perfect gift for practically anybody, for any occasion. Why not order a canvas featuring a favorite picture of you and your girlfriend, or a photo of your grandchildren for a proud grandma to display? The possibilities are endless. This is one gift that will surely make anybody happy.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 16x20 custom canvas of their creation from Canvas4Life.

<p> Cooking is one of many things that I enjoy in life. I'm not a gourmet chef by any means, but I find cooking relaxing and therapeutic. Of course I always love to try new recipes in the hopes of finding new dishes to create and serve. Like everyone else, I don't always have time to make a meal from scratch. I welcome any cooking shortcuts to help me make delicious meals, but in a fraction of the time. For that, I turn to Progresso.
<p> Crafted for taste, Progresso Soups are made from authentic recipes, using only the highest-quality ingredients. Their chef-inspired broths are 100% natural and deliver rich, homemade flavor. Progresso Foods brings you premium quality ingredients that can help you make a meal everyone will remember. At Progresso, they believe that food should always be delicious.
<p> I've been enjoying Progresso soups for as long as I can remember. What I love most about the brand is that they offer lower calorie or reduced sodium soups that are still equally delicious. They have so many delicious flavors that are sure to satisfy. A lot of their soups contain hearty servings of veggies, making them light, or 100 calories per serving. The soups are filling and wholesome.
<p> Recently, Progresso has introduced a new line of cooking sauces. Progresso Recipe Starters come in five varieties and give cooks a head start to home cooked. The five delectable flavors are creamy parmesan basil, creamy portabella mushroom, creamy roasted garlic, creamy three cheese, and fire roasted tomato. Don't these sound fabulous? Ideas of what to make with these sauces floated through my head as I awaited their arrival.
<p> Pretty soon, a big box showed up at my door containing the cooking sauces, 2 recipe booklets, and a Progresso branded wooden spoon. I love the way it was packaged too.
<p> I read through the recipe booklets for ideas and inspiration on what to make with these fabulous sounding sauces. There are so many different ways to incorporate these sauces into your meal, don't worry you'll never run out of ideas!
<p> I finally figured out what to make. I knew I wanted to use the creamy three cheese sauce first, so why not make a casserole? I got together noodles, broccoli, and ground chicken. I cooked them all and then poured them into a baking dish along with the cheese sauce to bake for about 20 minutes. Since the only thing that had to bake was the cheese sauce, I felt like that amount of time would be enough. The cheese sauce wasn't extremely thin, but it wasn't overly thick either. It was a beautiful soft yellow.
<p> 20 minutes later, this is what emerged. I love how beautifully everything cooked together. Do you see the cheese sauce?
<p> When I took the casserole out of the oven, the cheese sauce was bubbling away. It smelled wonderful. The dish tasted top notch too. The sauce really gave the casserole the burst of flavor it needed to be extra delicious. It wasn't overly cheesy, but it gave the dish the perfect amount of cheesiness. I don't like overly creamy and thick cheese sauces, so I was happy to see that the sauce wasn't like that. You could even make a casserole like this with the fire roasted tomato sauce and add a little bit of cheese for a fun Italian style dish. You could substitute my wide noodles for penne too.
<p> I am very much looking forward to trying the other sauces. I want to use the creamy mushroom sauce on chicken breasts and serve them with rice and a salad. I bet that will be delicious.
<p> When you use Progresso's new cooking sauces, you can become your own chef, which is the best part. Have fun creating new recipes and using these sauces in your favorite dishes. Experimenting and finding what works and doesn't is what cooking is all about.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Progresso for supplying me with these complimentary cooking sauces in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I've been watching Ripley's Believe It Or Not since I was a kid. The weird and bizarre oddities of people and objects are very intriguing. I think everyone is interested in hidden talents, but this takes hidden talents to a whole different level. Two headed sheeps, women with 20 inch waists and shrunken heads are just some of the freaky things that we love to see. Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum glorifies all that is strange for your viewing pleasure!
<p> Ripley's Believe It Or Not in New York City's Times Square showcases the odd and celebrates the weird and outlandish from around the world. Your self-guided adventure is sure to astonish as you come face to face and interact with remarkable relics and rare treasures from around the world in their museum attraction. For over 40 years, Robert Ripley - the real-life Indiana Jones - traveled the world collecting the unbelievable, the inexplicable and the one-of-a-kind. His vast collections praised as “amazing”, “ludicrously strange” and “extremely amusing” are now on display in their exhibits for you to see, hear and touch, Believe It or Not!
<p> I've lived in NY for years and have always wanted to go to the attraction, but never had the chance to. I've always been interested in Ripley's and knew that I would enjoy going. When I had the chance to review the establishment, I was looking forward to going.
<p> As I rode the train to Times Square, I was imagining what kind of things I would see inside. I pictured shrunken heads, extraordinarily tall or short people, two or three headed animals, and who knows what else! Ripley's is the perfect place to take your family to for a day of family fun. Your children will enjoy seeing all of the strange exhibits and the establishment is educational and entertaining for all. This is a perfect place to go to if you're looking for something different and out of the ordinary to do.
<p> Even before you go into the main galleries there are things to see in the lobby. Everywhere you look there is something that catches your eye.
<p> Don't tick him off!
<p> Ripley's is very large. There are more than 20 themed galleries on two separate floors featuring outrageous videos, interactive exhibits, and archival exhibits too. Whether you're wanting to see torture tools used decades ago, war masks, odd animals, and much more, there is a gallery that you will enjoy. I wanted to take my time and walk around the exhibits and make sure that I took everything in.
<p> I took some pictures as I walked into the first few galleries. The plaques below the pictures/exhibits are really detailed and inform you well of what you're seeing. I really enjoyed having the chance to see and learn about things I would otherwise not be able to see unless I went to Ripley's.
<p> It was interesting to see the museum through children's eyes. There were many families when I visited and it was actually pretty crowded. Some of them were scared, some were extremely curious, and others were asking questions and wanting to learn more about what they were seeing.
<p> I stopped and viewed everything and kept walking to the next and future galleries. I couldn't find anything that didn't pique my interest. I think that's the beauty of Ripley's, they appeal to any age. Each gallery contained many exhibits inside for you to see.
<p> A view of the main lobby from up above.
<p> What I liked most about certain galleries is how interactive they were. Instead of just reading a plaque, you can actually see a video about what you're looking at, or press a button and the exhibit becomes interactive. It keeps you hooked and provides you a different and more entertaining way to learn. Some of the interactive exhibits actually startled me, they spoke or made noise when I wasn't expecting it! I was even uncertain at times what I was going to see next as I walked through the museum, ha!
<p> There were monitors playing clips in some galleries from the Ripley's show, usually having to do with an exhibit in the same room.
<p> Seeing these exhibits was incredibly fascinating and cool. You don't realize things like this exist until you see them in person! The galleries and exhibits were well put together and everyone that I saw was having a good time and enjoying themselves.
<p> One thing I really enjoyed was the black hole. You go inside and it is sort of like a ride, you feel like you're tilting and falling off the earth. You can't see too well in there because it's dark, except for the lights on the side of the walls. It was a lot of fun! I didn't stay in too long because it was making me dizzy! It was funny to see how many people didn't want to go into the black hole, or they went in a few steps and quickly came back out. They even had a short cut for the "cowards!"
<p> Besides there being odd and strange things, there are very interesting things to see; like a picture of President Abraham Lincoln made completely of pennies, and a whole list of every odd thing swallowed by people. Did you know that someone once swallowed a needle and a screw? My stomach hurts just thinking about it!
<p> As I made my way into the final gallery and did the LaseRace, I couldn't believe that I had seen everything already. I felt like time just whizzed by because I was having such a good time. There's even a gift shop downstairs for you to buy odd items that are definite conversation starters.
<p> I really enjoyed my time at the museum and would love to come back in the future, especially if they ever change the exhibits. I loved being educated on subjects that I wasn't already tuned in to. I highly recommend coming to Ripley's if you're looking for something entertaining to do while in NYC. You won't be disappointed!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Ripley's for providing me with complimentary admission in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> If you cook a lot like me, you appreciate having kitchen items that are top notch and produce great results. I believe that quality food starts with quality tools. It's frustrating to use dull tools that hurt your food, rather than help it. Make sure that you have the sharpest knives to slice, dice, and chop the ingredients needed in your dishes.
<p> Hampton Forge is passionate about enhancing dining and entertaining by creating flatware, cutlery and accessories of artistic excellence, material quality and value. They produce gorgeous flatware in styles that will please everyone. Their knives are sharp, quality made, and long lasting. If you're looking to update your kitchen, Hampton Forge is your go-to brand.
<p> I received the opportunity to review three Hampton Forge printed paring knives, I was looking forward to it. I use paring knives to peel fruits and veggies, and also to chop small items. A paring knife should be an essential item in everyone's kitchen.
<p> What I like most about these knives is that they are perfect to use for the rest of the summer. Each knife features a summer fruit; red tomatoes, green apples, and citrus oranges. They are very cute. The colors on the knives are bright and they are full of personality. I've always had plain black paring knives, so I welcome anything to bring color and fun to my kitchen and meal prep.
<p> The knives are very sharp and worked effortlessly to help me chop a small piece of garlic and cut up an orange. Of course I used the orange knife on the orange! The knives are fairly large and the handle is long and comfortable to hold and grip while using them. The dishwasher-safe and high-grade stainless steel shell non-stick coating offers ease in meal preparation safety, with its matching blade guards that maintain product sharpness while in storage. The knives also come with a 30-year warranty. If you have small children around, the blade guards are the perfect way to keep curious hands away from sharp objects.
<p> I'm very satisfied with the knives so far. They would make a great gift for a college student or someone who just moved into a new apartment or house. Why not help in bringing fun to someone's kitchen?
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 6 piece printed paring knife set (3 knives and 3 blade guards) from Hampton Forge.

<p> Like every woman, I love to shop. Shoes, purses, clothes, and accessories? Of course I love them all! Quality items last longer than items that aren't as expensive, it's a proven fact. It might seem like a smarter decision at the time to buy that cheaper priced item, but in the long run it isn't. That less expensive sweater or dress might not last as many washings or wears as the more expensive dress could. I like having quality, higher end items that I can enjoy for years to come. Every woman should adopt this philosophy.
<p> Tom Ford offers designer makeup, fragrance, skin care, men and women's clothing and accessories. I most associate the brand with their gorgeous sunglasses. The quality made sunglasses come in a variety of styles and colors for all preferences. The eyewear collection introduces frames that are strong, yet architecturally simple in design. Tom Ford takes their inspiration from authentic icons in eyewear; the aviator, sporting glasses, and more exaggerated film star shapes. An arbiter of well executed details and meticulous craftsmanship, Ford has created a collection that combines luxurious materials and dramatic styles. The cosmetic and fragrance products are created for anyone's skin tone and beauty needs as well. Why not wear a pair of shades with a look from the new summer 2012 collection for an ultimate great look?
<p> When I had the opportunity to review a pair of Tom Ford sunglasses, I was extremely excited. I browsed the collection of sunglasses and with each passing pair, my eyes grew wider! It was very hard to choose, each pair was so gorgeous. I finally settled on the beautiful Lydia sunglasses in the Havana color. I couldn't wait to get them and wear them. My current sunglasses needed an upgrade desperately!
<p> Aren't these just stunning? This is my first pair of Tom Ford sunglasses, but I've always coveted the shades in his collection. The sunglasses are a deep rich brown with hints of tortoiseshell throughout the outside of the frames. I've always loved big glasses, so I was instantly attracted to them. They are very stylish and I love the way they look on. The glasses are incredibly well made and you can tell they were created with dedication and care. They came in a brown velvety case with information about them, and a cleaning cloth inside which is perfect to store them in when you're not wearing them. They block out the sun well but still allow me to be outside comfortably. The sunglasses fit well and are not heavy on my face, and I had no issues with them while wearing them.
<p> What I love most about them is that I'll be able to wear them all year round. They work for every season and can be paired with different outfits to help me complete a great look!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to the PR agency representing Tom Ford for sending me the complimentary sunglasses in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Cheesecake is one of those treats that when you indulge in it, all is right in the world. The perfectly creamy and sweet treat is just the pick-me-up that you need. The fact that it tastes wonderfully decadant isn't bad either. Cheesecake is best shared with friends or family over lots of laughs and warm conversation.
<p> Decadence Cheesecakes are gourmet cheesecakes which are individually packed in their own jars. More than 20 flavors are offered, which are sure to satisfy anyone's cheesecake desires. Some flavors include chocolate chai, chocolate mole, tiramisu cheesecake and many others to satisfy any chocolate cravings you might have. If you're looking to step away from chocolate, why not try the Outer Banks which features peanut butter, or a delicious pear/chardonnay treat? I can guarantee that you will love them. The unique thing about Decadence Cheesecake is that they offer savory cheesecake dips too, which I've never heard of or tried before. I usually associate cheesecake with being sweet, not savory. Some of those flavors include chorizo/black bean, bacon/blue cheese, sun dried tomato, or crab and salmon. How unique!
<p> I was sent a 6 pack of the "Before and After" cheesecake samplers. I received such wonderful flavors as strawberry NY cheesecake, bacon/blue cheese, and tiramisu, just to name a few. They all sounded fantastic and I couldn't wait to try them! The jars are the perfect size for enjoying by yourself, or with friends. They came in a cute little wooden crate too. These treats would be perfect for gift-giving. You could even save the jars and reuse them too.
<p> Here's an example of what the cheesecake in a jars look like. Aren't they cute?
<p> I tried the bacon/blue cheese with some large multigrain tortilla chips first (you could also use toasted pita bread or bagel chips too.) What I first noticed was that it was very thick and looked like it had many layers. I could smell the dip the second I took the lid off the jar, the aroma of it made my mouth water! I scooped a hefty amount up on a chip and prepared to be transported to a savory cheesecake land, far far away. My chip effortlessly cut through the fluffy dip. Upon first bite, I tasted a very interesting combination of blue cheese and bacon. Each flavor was distinct, but I could taste them individually as well. It was very creamy and the texture was wonderful. I would never think to combine blue cheese and bacon together, but they really compliment each other well. The dip was thick and had a cheesecake consistency, but it wasn't sweet. I had never tried anything like this before. I had another bite or two, or three. :). The dip was very fresh and I highly recommend this dip for your next party if you're looking for a crowd-pleasing, out of the ordinary item to serve.
<p> Of course it was time for something sweet next. On the sweet menu was the strawberry NY cheesecake. I've always been a fan of strawberry cheesecake and I was hoping this would delight my taste buds immensely. The strawberry cheesecake was a beautiful glossy color, almost similiar to the color of strawberry jam. I grabbed a spoon from the kitchen and prepared to be in love. I scooped my spoon into the jar and when it emerged, I was presented with a beautiful tri color layer confectionary treat on my spoon that I just had to taste! I had an equal amount of the crust, the cream cheese, and the strawberry. It was absolutely heavenly. It was perfectly chilled and was creamy, rich, thick and everything that I could possibly want in a bite of cheesecake. The cake was sweet, but not overly sweet. The flavor of the strawberry was very prevalent and wonderful. Each bite was better than the last, and the NY style of the cheesecake was represented well in this delectable dessert. This was just the afternoon treat that I needed to perk me up. I absolutely enjoyed it immensely and wish that I could have another jar of it soon! Cheesecake truly does makes everything better.
<p> I can't wait to try the other flavors of the cheesecakes and dips soon, I just know I will love them. If you haven't tried Decadence Cheesecakes previously, I urge you to try them!
<p> Why not take 20% off a future purchase by using the coupon code "Sammi"? The code would be good for 90 days, through 11/18/12.

<p> There are some desserts that are timeless and loved by all. A brownie filled with pretzel bits and toffee may not be wanted by everyone, but a piece of pound cake will always please everyone. You can't go wrong with pound cake. It is delicious, light and fluffy, and goes great with ice cream. I think I hear it calling my name right now, better not keep it waiting!
<p> The Cake Crate Co specializes in an assortment of mini gourmet pound cakes. While their cakes are personal sized we guarantee you will not miss any of the full southern flavor. Offering more than 20 flavors (10 full flavored cake in a petite size.) With attention to detail and quality no matter what cake you choose it will be made with the finest and freshest ingredients. Delivered in its own mini natural wood handcrafted crate, each cake recipe has been and will be born in the south to assure we don't compromise the southern tradition or experience.
<p> The adorable mini cakes come in many mouth watering flavors such as s'mores (which is the flavor of the month), peach cobber, strawberry, banana, lemon, chocolate, blueberry, apple pie and many more. Which flavor sounds best to you?
<p> I chose to review chocolate, because if you know me, you know I love my chocolate. The cake showed up in a cute "crate" tied with string.
<p> As I carefully opened the crate, I couldn't wait to see what the hand-crafted confectionery treat that was inside looked like.
<p> This was the beauty that I laid my eyes on. My favorite thing about the cake was probably the size. I've never seen a pound cake that little before and I thought it was the best thing ever! It would be the perfect size to indulge with a friend and not feel overly guilty. You could also give these as a gift for the upcoming Holiday season. If you present this to a friend or family member, they will absolutely love it.
<p> I cut myself a small piece and poured an ice cold glass of milk. I took my first of many bites. I instantly noticed that the cake was very fresh and full of fantastic flavor that only a pound cake could provide. It was dense, but not overly dense, but also was light and fluffy at the same time. The chocolate chips were sprinkled in throughout the cake, ensuring a chocolate experience with each bite. The chocolate was rich and sweet and gave the cake an added note of sweetness, which I really loved. Since the cake is small, you don't feel as guilty for enjoying since the piece that you would have would be very small. The treat was sweet, but not overly sweet. It definitely satisfied my sweet tooth though. I really enjoyed the cake and look forward to having another piece and trying the other flavors soon!
<p> A cake from The Cake Crate Co would be great to take to someone as a thank you present, a housewarming gift, or even as a hostess gift for someone hosting a dinner party or get together. Whichever cake you choose, your recipient will be thrilled to receive it.
