<p> It's very hard to stay away from Baskin-Robbins. Honestly I think it is impossible. They are always coming out with a new confectionery treat that keeps my sweet tooth waiting for more! A scoop of creamy rich ice cream melts all of your troubles away.
<p> Baskin Robbins is the world’s largest chain of ice cream specialty shops with more than 6,000 retail shops in 33 countries. Baskin-Robbins was founded by two ice cream enthusiasts whose passion led to the creation of more than 1,000 ice cream flavors and a wide variety of delicious treats.
<p> Whether you have a craving for a banana split, hot fudge sundae, or a scoop of vanilla with gummy bears on top, Baskin-Robbins has your ice cream needs covered. They also have premade ice cream cakes and pies available for purchase. A fabulous cake would be the perfect thing to serve at your Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner!
<p> The newest sweet treat to be offered are the ice cream cake bites. These are delectable bite-sized versions of our famous ice cream cakes. Each bite takes delicious Baskin-Robbins ice cream and cake, and wraps it up in icing and a simple accent finish. Cake Bites cost $2.99 individually or are $9.99 for a mix-n-match 4-pack and are available in the following four flavors; Double Chocolate, Praline Caramel, Chocolate Mint, and Vanilla Blondie.
<p> These are absolutely incredible! My favorites are of course double chocolate and chocolate mint. They are the perfect balance of cake and ice cream. A luscious treat that is simply excellent and sure to please.
<p> Nothing is better than ice cream and cake, and Baskin-Robbins has outdone itself again and put together two great treats into one delectable pairing!

<p> There's nothing quite like QVC. A whole channel dedicated to what I love most, shopping! You don't even have to go to the store and deal with annoying crowds either. You can order your favorite perfume or even a gorgeous necklace while laying in bed in your pajamas! QVC offers thousands among thousands of products that anyone would love.
<p> QVC is a multinational corporation specializing in televised home shopping. Founded in 1986 by Joseph Segel in West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania. QVC broadcasts in five countries as QVC US, QVC UK, QVC Germany, QVC Japan and – QVC Italy to 200 million households. The name is an acronym standing for Quality, Value, Convenience.
<p> Whether you're looking for a new comforter set, state of the art shiny electronics, or even a vacuum that will suck up dirt you didn't even know was in your rug, QVC has you covered. QVC is also your Christmas gift headquarters! Avoid the long lines and do your Christmas shopping with your telephone. :)
<p> Back in September, I was invited to a QVC media party. I met David Venable, host of In the Kitchen with David. I had a wonderful time and I had the exciting opportunity to interview him!
<p> My questions are in bold.
<p> 1. What is your advice for people who enjoy cooking but feel some recipes are too complicated? Be confident! You might be surprised how well the recipe turns out. It always helps me to read the recipe completely before I cook. Some dishes take a long time, while others take only a few minutes. Being familiar with the cook times and instructions will go a long way toward making the recipe a success. Also make sure you have all your ingredients and tools handy before you start. As you cook, don’t be afraid to improvise. Baking is more of an exact science; cooking certainly isn’t. It’s about creating great meals and great memories for your family and friends.
<p> 2. What are some great low-fat or low calorie substitutions for everyday meals or desserts?When I bake, I often replace half the “fat” (from ingredients like butter, oil, or shortening) with unsweetened apple sauce or another fruit puree of pineapples or bananas. You can even use a veggie puree of sweet potatoes, pumpkin, or zucchini in some recipes. In all your cooking, you can make it a habit to use margarine instead of butter and a lighter oil like canola, sunflower, or extra virgin olive oil. Also consider using a sugar or salt substitute whenever possible. Nowadays, many substitutes measure spoon-for-spoon and cup-for-cup, which is really convenient.
<p> 3. How did your passion for cooking come about?Growing up, it wasn’t unusual for my mother to spend lots of time making comforting body-and-soul warming meals for my brother, sister, and me. She loved to cook. But more than anything, she loved having “all her chickens round the table!” I’m not sure my mother would admit it, but she was truly ahead of her time. She never underestimated the importance of a family meal. In fact, family dinners weren’t optional. We joined her at the table every night, and the world stopped until the dishes were cleared. We listened, fell into comfortable, meaningful conversation, and embraced the comfort of family time. That’s where my passion began.
<p> 4. What's one of your favorite recipes to make?I’m a meat and potatoes type of guy, so one meal that immediately comes to mind is my French Onion Soup Meatloaf with Mashed Potato Topping. This is a hearty, comforting, all-in-one dish that’s always a hit with my friends and family. And, it’s incredibly easy to make. There’s nothing better than a big helping of this on a chilly autumn or winter’s day!
<p> 5. Is there a kitchen tool or appliance you consider an absolute essential?One of my all-time favorites is the Cook’s Essentials® 4-qt. Digital Pressure Cooker (http://qvc.co/K34606). Now, this is electric, so it’s much safer than those questionable pressure cookers we all remember! This is extremely user friendly and cuts cooking time by as much as 70%. Plus, foods retain more of the healthy nutrients that get lost during the conventional cooking process.
<p> 6. What is a quick, easy dinner recipe you can share from your collection?My Easy Cheesy Bacon Chicken is one of my favorites. I LOVE bacon and I love cheese, and this recipe highlights both ingredients in a simple, yet effective way. Here’s the recipe. By the way, you can find this one and all my recipes on QVC.com. (http://qvc.co/Davids_Recipes)Easy Cheesy Bacon ChickenIngredients: 4 slices bacon, chopped4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves 1/2 tsp. paprika1/4 lb. easy-melting cheese (like Velveeta), cut into cubes1/4 cup chicken broth2 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsleySalt and ground black pepper to taste Directions: In a large nonstick sauté pan (about 2.75 qt.) over medium heat, cook the bacon for 4 minutes or until crisp. Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels. Discard all but 1 Tbsp. of the bacon fat.
<p> Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook over medium heat for 5 — 6 minutes on each side or until cooked through.
<p> Combine the pasteurized cheese and chicken broth in a small saucepan (about 1.25 qt.). Cook over medium-low heat for 2 — 3 minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is well combined. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, sprinkle with bacon and fresh parsley, and serve.
<p> I really enjoyed David's answers and they were really insightful! QVC is going to make a foodie's dream come true by offering one lucky winner a chance to win a Le Creuset 12" x 9-1/2" Rectangular Dish in Caribbean Blue.

<p> Entertaining and serving friends and family are what the holidays are all about. It's not easy to carry all of the food and drinks at once on serving trays. If you've ever accidentally had something fall off of a tray when you're walking into a room, don't worry you're not alone. It's hard to balance plates and cups, but now your serving duties are revolutionized!
<p> For more than 30 years MasterBuilt's passion has been to design quality outdoor cooking equipment that is simple to use. From the first propane fish cooker, to the user-friendly Butterball Indoor Electric Turkey Fryer, they offer a complete line of outdoor and indoor cooking products designed with the consumer in mind. Masterbuilt's standard of excellence is to design the most innovative products in the industry and markets they serve.
<p> When I think of grills and smokers, MasterBuilt is the first brand that comes to mind. The products are excellent, grill your food wonderfully, and are built to last.
<p> MasterBuilt has recently come out with a new product called Lappers trays. These are a definite necessity in life and are great for folks who entertain a lot.
<p> Lappers dining trays come with removable silicon mats to keep dishes in place, are dishwasher safe &amp; can be used as hot pads. They come in a variety of styles and colors depending on your taste and preference. I chose an adorable Zebra tray.
<p> Keeps dishes in place at up to a 65° angle
<p> •Dishwasher safe
<p> •Stores conveniently
<p> •Large comfortable handles
<p> •Made from strong, durable melamine plastic
<p> •Removable silicon mats
<p> •Mats can be used as hot pads
<p> This tray is incredible! Never again will you have to worry about spilling something while carrying it on a tray. The silicone mats stay firmly and securely in place and do not move unless you take them off.
<p> Even though there is no food in this bowl, you can see how when the tray is raised at an angle, the bowl does not move. I've never seen anything as unique as this product before. If a child handles your serving tray, you won't have to worry about anything spilling from it.
<p> I love the zebra pattern of the tray, it's very fun and lively. The tray is made of very durable plastic that will not be ruined easily. It's built tough for a lot of use. The tray is light-weight and easy to carry. The handles are comfortable to hold too. Why not use this tray to serve Christmas or Thanksgiving hors d'oeuvres on, for next summer's family BBQ, or just when you're having friends over? This would make the perfect hostess gift or housewarming present too. Virtually everyone would have a use for this tray. Give it as a Christmas gift for that resident foodie in your life and have them be wowed!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Lapper tray of their choosing. Please visit the tray choices here. http://www.masterbuilt.com/lappertrays.html

<p> Can you believe it's already November? It's almost Thanksgiving, and then soon enough it will be Christmas! I LOVE Christmas, especially the yummy holiday treats. In just about a month it will be time to get out those Christmas decorations and start decorating your house and tree!
<p> ScentSicles are scented ornaments that instantly bring the joy of Christmas to your home. They can be hung from tree boughs, tucked in wreaths and garlands, or hidden in holiday decor to spread the authentic scent of fresh-cut Christmas trees throughout your home. They blend in easily with your tree and look very real. If you have an artifical tree, these will make your tree smell authentic! ScentSicles conveniently come in a pack of 6 sticks.
<p> Scentsicles are made of natural fibers sourced from sustainable resources and infused with pure fragrance. This product is great for a no mess, no flame, simple way to make artificial greenery smell real, enhance the scent of a live tree, or just add scent as a decoration to any room. They are safe around pets and kids, so no need to worry. They come in four delicious scents including fresh-cut fir, fresh-cut pine, fresh-cut spruce and cinnamon stick. These all represent the scent of Christmas perfectly! What's your favorite scent?
<p> There are many other ways to additionally use ScentSicles. You can hide a few scented ornaments in the hall closet so guests experience a waft of fragrance when you open and close the door to get their coats. You can give them as a thoughtful gift to hair stylists, mail carriers, and teachers. A great use for these would be to bring a little holiday cheer to your workspace. Place one or two Scentsicles in your office plant and everyone will be smelling the plant all day! Get creative and make your house smell warm and inviting.
<p> Even though we just celebrated Halloween, it may be hard to resist the urge to place ScentSicles in your house early. Try to resist the urge for just a few more weeks though! :)
<p> Christmas is a special holiday to spend with friends and family. It's sometimes hard to get into the holiday spirit, but with one whiff of a ScentSicle you'll be in the holiday spirit instantly! You'll want to keep Scentsicles in your home long after Christmas is over, I can guarantee you. :)

<p> Getting packages is a lot of fun. I look forward to my doorbell ringing and UPS or Fed-Ex bringing me something fantastic in a big box to review. I feel that everyone should get surprises on a regular basis. I wanted my boyfriend to join in on the fun too. He doesn't regularly indulge in clothes or shoes, so I wanted to get something special for him.
<p> Allen Edmonds products are sought throughout the world by men who appreciate true quality and American Classic styling. The company has been around since 1922 and the shoes are made from the highest quality products available. The shoes are classic and timeless and look great with practically any outfit you pair them with. This company also offers shoe care kits, belts, accessories, and apparel. For any of your high-fashion needs, Allen Edmonds has you covered.
<p> The shoes are absolutely gorgeous. Allen Edmonds offers many different styles for whatever shoe style and preference you're looking for. You can guarantee that the shoe will be built to last and you'll be very satisfied with it.
<p> I surfed onto the company's website and knew that I just had to have a pair of the Kenwood shoes for my boyfriend. They were the first pair that jumped out at me and I instantly loved them. They are such a classy, beautiful pair of shoes.
<p> These loafers are just fantastic! My boyfriend absolutely loves them and they fit him great. He says they are very comfortable. They slip on easily and are not heavy on his feet at all. The leather is beautiful, and I love the deep rich brown of the shoe. The stitching is top notch and impeccable. He doesn't own a pair of shoes like these, so he was happy to have something different. The shoes are perfect for wearing as a work shoe, but they also double as a dress shoe and a casual shoe too. I love that they are versatile and work with so many different outfits. A shoe like this one never goes out of style, it's truly timeless. He's never had a shoe like this before and I think now he's hooked on the Allen Edmonds brand! :) Any item from Allen Edmonds would make a perfect gift for your husband or boyfriend for Christmas. Keep them in mind as you make your shopping list for gifts!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Allen Edmonds for providing me with a complimentary pair of shoes for review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Organization is key in my house. Since I live in a small apartment, I really try to keep everything in a certain place and together to optimize the space. When I recently received a Keurig I was thrilled. I was not so thrilled that the K-cup boxes took up so much room in my pantry. I knew that I had to find a solution for better organization of the coffee. When CoffeeStack entered my life, it was a match made in heaven.
<p> CoffeeStack is a sleek, efficient solution for coffee pod clutter. It's a K-Cup holder designed specifically for the kitchen cabinet so the consumer can free up space on the counter top and stay organized, said Lauren Greenwood, vice president of sales and marketing for YouCopia Product, Inc., maker of CoffeeStack.
<p> This product measures just over 5 inches wide and fits in all standard kitchen cabinets. Four drawers hold a total of 40 K-Cups, making CoffeeStack the highest-capacity K-Cup organizer of its size on the market. It's easy to use too. Simply pull the drawer out until it's extended and lower it to a resting position at eye-level. Since all of the K-Cups labels face out, it's easy to select the coffee of choice. Refill with new K-Cups as needed by dropping each pod into an empty older. The black and silver colors of this unit match the most popular coffee machine models. No assembly is necessary. Non-skid rubber feet hold Coffeestack securely in place in the cabinet and units can be stacked.
<p> This unit is beyond perfect for me. I have a sick K-cup obsession at the moment. I have 11 boxes in my house and my boyfriend has banned me from buying anymore until we go through a majority of them. I'm sorry but how can I resist flavors like cinnamon bun, gingerbread, and chocolate glazed donut? I can't! As you can imagine, those boxes take up a lot of space in my cabinets. I love that the unit fits directly inside my kitchen cabinet with no issues at all. It doesn't take up a lot of space at all. I love the attractive silver and black design of it too. It's very modern. Anybody who has stainless steel appliances will love that the unit matches.
<p> I had no problem putting the K-cups in the holders in each drawer. Each K-cup fit perfectly and the drawer closed with ease after I was done filling it. I pulled the drawer open and closed and it did not get stuck at all. The drawers slide down with ease when you want a K-cup that's in the back of the drawer too. I have tea in the first drawer, hot chocolate in the second drawer, and coffee K-cups in the last two drawers. I love that it's organized this way. It makes my life so much easier to open a drawer and select the cup I want, rather than rifling through all of the boxes and making my cabinets messy when I'm looking for the K-cup I want. Just refill the holders after you take a coffee and you'll be good to go! I truly love this product. This first unit does not hold irregular shaped K-cups properly. Luckily I didn't have any irregular shaped ones and all of mine fit properly. This is a design flaw that has been corrected in the newer models. This unit would make a fabulous gift for anyone with a Keurig or for someone you know who's planning on buying a Keurig. This will make their life so much easier and they will wonder how they ever lived without it.
<p> You can buy the CoffeeStack on their website or at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* A big thank you to CoffeeStack for providing me with the complimentary unit in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> I did a Zevia review a few months back and really enjoyed the soda. I am not regular soda drinker but sometimes you just crave those addictive fizzy drinks. I'm all for anything with no sugar or calories, so Zevia is right up my alley. I can always count on Zevia to satisfy my soda craving.
<p> Zevia is the first all natural zero calorie soda. With only pure ingredients, Zevia contains none of the chemically processed artificial sugar substitutes, artificial flavors or artificial colors found in other diet sodas. Zevia is all-natural, has zero calories, zero net carbs, zero fat, and little or no sodium (depending on flavor).
<p> With Zevia there's never a lack of flavor or taste. The soda flavors are truly delicious. You can choose from Dr. Zevia, cola, ginger ale, black cherry, orange, twist, and ginger root beer. I've tried them all and my two personal favorites are black cherry and twist.
<p> Zevia has a new flavor on the market called Mountain. From the moment I saw the Zevia package on my doorstep, I couldn't wait to have a sip or two, or three of it. :) The can is a very pretty shade of lime green that catches my eye instantly. It of course matches a mountain. Zevia is best served cold. The colder the better, actually. I popped open the tab and heard that crack of fizziness which instantly warmed my heart.
<p> The soda has a distinctive yellow tint to it. I had a sip of it and it was fantastic, just like I remember Zevia sodas being. It has a very mild lime flavor to it. I really liked the lime taste. I like that the flavor is subtle actually because when lime is too overpowering, it can be bad. Even though the soda is sweet, don't worry you're not drinking sugar! The bubbles are certainly in abundance in this can and the carbonation from the soda was top notch. The soda goes down smooth and it is certainly a refreshing beverage. I love that something this good has zero calories and sugar. It's almost too good to be true, but it is! Zevia would be perfect to enjoy after a long day at work. Serve this bubbly beverage at your next party (to be mixed or to drink alone), everyone will love it!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a coupon for a free 6 pack of Zevia soda.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me which flavor of Zevia is your favorite. (1 entry)

<p> I'm not a huge wine drinker. I like the occasional glass when with friends or family though. Red wine definitely compliments a meal well and I feel it's best served over great food and lots of laughs with your loved ones. :)
<p> Apothic has an interesting origin. More than 800 years ago, vintners blended and stored their most coveted concoctions in a mysterious place called Apotheca. In late 2005, a master winemaker envisioned an epic red wine combining old world traditions of blending while realizing a markedly new world style. Thus began the path that led his protégé, winemaker Boyd Morrison, to select grapes from California's bountiful vineyards for this new blended red. Morrison was inspired to blend spicy Zinfandel, with smooth Merlot and lush, dark Syrah to create Apothic Red.
<p> I'm always interested to try new wines, so when I stumbled across Apothic I was very interested to try it. I was sent a 2009 bottle of Apothic red for review.
<p> A captivating blend of three distinct grapes, with the dark fruit flavors of Syrah, brambly spice of Zinfandel, and a smooth elegance of Merlot.
<p> Apothic Red reveals intense fruit aromas and flavors of rhubarb and black cherry that are complemented by hints of mocha, chocolate, brown spice and vanilla. The plush, velvety mouthfeel and smooth finish round out this intriguing, full-bodied red blend.
<p> The first thing I noticed about this bottle of wine was the intriguing, yet mysterious design of the bottle. The entire bottle is black with a red top. Red and black are beautiful together and a classic combination. The label of the bottle was black and red too. It reminded me of Halloween. I kept the bottle at room temperature.
<p> I poured myself a glass of the red beauty and prepared to be captivated by its interesting flavors. It smelled wonderful too. It was so delicious and by far the best glass of red wine I've had in a while! It was unlike any other wine I've ever sampled before either.
<p> The fruit flavors were instantly recognizable and truly fantastic. I loved the combination of the many notes of flavor with the rhubarb and black cherry. What an interesting combination! The wine had such a full-bodied, robust taste that made all of the flavors taste wonderful together. The wine reminded me of Fall because it had a hint of spiciness which I loved. This would be a perfect after dinner or dessert wine. I will definitely be recommending this wine to anyone I know. It is truly fantastic. Pair it with a slice of chocolate cake and you'll be in heaven.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Apothic Wine for providing me this sample bottle of wine in exchange for the review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> I wrote a Teva sneaker review a few months back. I was truly impressed with the quality and durability of the shoe. I knew I had to review more of their products. I feel very strongly about Teva's background and their company mission too. Teva truly cares about making a fantastic shoe with the consumer in mind and that means a lot to me.
<p> Teva offers a full range of hiking, sport, casual shoes and sandals for men, women, and children. There are various styles and colors for anyone's taste and preference. A pair of sport or hiking shoes from this company would make a fantastic gift for the athletic individual in your family. Start your child or even infant off young with a cute pair of Teva sandals too.
<p> Since it's cold in NYC and tends to snow a lot during the winter, I knew I needed a great pair of boots to trek through the snow with. I don't already have an authentic pair of snow boots and knew I need them. Teva suggested the Vero waterproof boot in dark gull grey.
<p> T.I.D.E COMFORT ◦200 grams of Thinsulate insulation by 3M will keep your feet warm through all of your cold-weather adventures. ◦A zipper on the side lets you get in and out quickly. ◦Heel to toe EVA Strobel lasting (translation: there’s cushioning in this thing from the ground up). ◦A Shoc Pad™ in the heel makes for a smooth ride. ◦Our Mush® Infused Insole brings the absurd comfort of our flip flops into a boot.
<p> It snowed today so I wore the boots to test them out. They took a little time to properly get them on and get used to wearing them. Once on, they fit me well and were very comfortable to wear. They were easy to walk around in and weren't heavy on my feet at all. The zipper on the side allows easy access for putting them on or taking them off. The neutral color of the boot is perfect.
<p> The boots are designed very well and I am impressed. They are made for the upcoming frigid temperatures and snow that NYC will have. The shoe is insulated well with Thinsulate technology and will keep my feet warm which I am thankful for. It was about 38 degrees today and in normal boots my feet are very cold, but these boots kept my feet warm and snuggly. I loved it! I hate when boots are not warm inside and my feet are freezing. I love that the shoes are waterproof too and will keep my feet and socks dry if caught in the rain. My jeans tuck into the boots easily too. I feel confident that I can wear these during the bitter cold days and my feet will be properly protected.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Teva for providing me with these complimentary boots in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I'm dedicating this week's post to Halloween. Bring on the monsters, ghouls, and goblins!
<p> What are your plans for Halloween? Will your child be trick-or-treating this weekend or on Monday night?
<p> Halloween in NYC is very different. I grew up going door to door in my neighborhood collecting my sugary loot from various houses. The kids here go from store to store to receive their candy. They might start at the bank, then go to the drug store, then to the grocery store, etc. Obviously this is what the children are used to and they probably only see "authentic" trick or treating in movies or books. They do go from apartment to apartment in their building if the building allows it at least. The neighbors sign up if they want to give out candy. I find it a little sad that the kids here don't have the suburban trick-or-treating experience. There are so many kids in this city that the stores can run out of candy early. At least with a neighborhood, you can anticipate how many kids you'll receive from previous years and you can buy the candy accordingly.
<p> I remember being able to go up to the houses myself with friends while our parents waited at the end of the driveway. They also knew the owners of the house and knew we would be okay. You can't do that here because you don't know who's around you and if any danger could possibly be lurking.
<p> Even though I am way too old to trick-or-treat, I can remember how exciting trick-or-treating was and I always loved getting into my costume too. It's fun to see all of the kids' costumes as I walk the area I live. My favorite candy was always Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and 3 Musketeers. I always loved getting those in my pumpkin basket.

<p> Since I'm on the computer throughout the day everyday, it's important to me to keep my computer in great working shape. It's not good for the computer to get overheated and not be able to perform properly. If the computer gets too hot it slows down and you won't be able to work properly.

<p> I was sent a portable lapguard with radiation shielding technology for review.
<p> This lapguard is perfect for me. I regularly use my computer in bed or on the couch and it gets hot after a few hours. I think it's because it doesn't have proper airflow.
<p> The lapguard is a very modern and sleek black and grey. My computer fits easily on top of it. It's very easy to use, just plug it into your USB port and pretty soon your computer will be cool and comfortable. The lapguard is not heavy on my lap at all, it is very light. I've had cooling pads before that were so loud that you could hear it from the next room. The fans in this product are very quiet and you can barely hear them, which I like. My computer has drastically reduced in overheating since using this product, and I'm very happy about that.
<p> I'm a big fan of the technology in the product that reduces the exposure to harmful laptop radiation and heat. That's something that I obviously don't like and I like that the product was created with consumer's concerns in mind. The lapguard does not affect the computer's performance at all. This is a product that everyone be using with their laptop constantly. It can easily be stored in a drawer or cabinet when the computer is turned off. The lapguard is small enough to easily travel with too.
<p> I am thankful to now have this product. Everytime I use my computer, you can guarantee that the lapguard is underneath making sure that my computer is at its optimal performance.

<p> It's important to me to keep my electronics protected. I want to ensure that are housed in cases that provides the ultimate support and protection for them at all times. I also want to make sure my cases are stylish too and for that I turn to Case Logic.
<p> Case Logic was founded in 1984 in Boulder, Colorado. Beginning with just two audiocassette storage cases, they helped create and expand the growing field of audio storage. Today, Case Logic offers a full line of portable and home storage accessories for CDs, DVDs, portable electronics, laptops, cameras and automobiles. Most recently, they have expanded into the travel and luggage market with backpacks, messenger bags and luggage. Known for innovative design and functionality, they provide the most complete selection of storage accessories in the industry.
<p> Back in the 90's and early 2000's I always kept my CD's in a Case Logic CD case. I trust this brand for reliability, durability, and top notch products.
<p> I recently bought a Kindle and could not find a case that I liked for it in stores. I found the perfect case on Case Logic's website and I knew I had to review it. I was sent the 7" eReader Sleeve with External Cord Pocket in red to review.
<p> This case is absolutely perfect for my needs. First of all, I love the color. Red is such a fun, vibrant color and I feel that it reflects my personality well. My kindle fits perfectly inside and it securely stays protected and zipped inside. I won't have to worry about the kindle flopping around in it at all. The pocket on the top of the case is perfect for storing my charger or my travel clip light if I'm traveling. You can also keep money or credit cards in it too. The case is very light and has a thin, compact design. The case zips and unzips with ease. It easily stores in my purse or a suitcase for on the go travel. I am very satisfied with this case and I can't wait to give my kindle a new home in it!

<p> Using Carmex in the winter is an absolute necessity for me. The wonderful lotions and lip balms keep all of my dry winter skin at bay. I always keep tubes of Carmex lip balm in my purse, in my bathroom, and in my nightstand drawer. I've been using Carmex for years and I truly rely and depend on the brand. I'm a customer for life! I always tell my friends and family about the brand too if they are unaware.
<p> Carmex is a cosmetics company which offers various scents of lipbalms dedicated to soothe and protect your lips. They have recently branched out with a line of skincare which includes healing cream and healing lotion. Whether you prefer original Carmex lip balm, or even the new flavors of strawberry or cherry in a tube or a jar, they've got you covered.
<p> Since I'm a part of the Carmex Blog Squad, I frequently get sent items to review. I recently received a small box and when I saw the Carmex return address label I knew it had to be good!
<p> I love Carmex's presentation of their products. They package the products with care and dedication and are always presented in a fun way. I love the red and yellow crinkled paper to match the tubes of lotion! How clever.
<p> I actually had a tube of the healing cream in my house before I was sent this kit, so I was aware of the product already. I had a rough patch on my hand at the time that just couldn't seem to stay moisturized with any product, so I went to the drugstore to investigate another product to help. I saw Carmex's healing cream and knew it had to be good. I started reading the bottle and saw that the cream could help repair your driest, roughest skin. Carmex and something that could take away my rough skin? I knew it had to be an awesome product! The product also contains 9 healing ingredients which is an added plus.
<p> The first time I used the cream, I was very impressed. The thin tube was easy to grasp and had a very attractive label design which was not cluttered with information. The cream came out easily, rubbed in well, had a pleasant smell, and was non-greasy (which is an important factor for me.) I dislike when a product has a greasy feel that doesn't go away. My hand instantly felt smoother and hydrated. Within 3 times of using the cream on a daily basis, the rough patch was gone. I was very amazed because no other product seemed to do the job that Carmex could. This is why I feel so strongly about this brand. The healing cream would be perfect for dry, cracked elbows, heels, and ankles during the winter.
<p> I was not aware of the healing lotion before I received it, but was interested in trying it. You're supposed to use it daily to soothe and protect dry skin. This is a product that I could always use more of. The product is also non-greasy and contains aloe and Vitamin E which are key nutrients your skin needs. The healing lotion is in a wider tube than the healing cream, which I am not sure why. The lotion comes out easily and rubs in well as well. I used the product on my legs and after rubbing the lotion in, my legs were so soft and smooth! They felt extremely moisturized. I know that my skin is receiving the nutrients that it needs from this product. These two products are going to be my key go-to winter solutions for dry skin!
<p> The little tubes are perfect for throwing into your purse, storing in your glove compartment or desk drawer, or even traveling with. They are small and don't take up much space. Make sure wherever you are, you're never without Carmex when you need it!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Carmex Blog Squad for providing me these products in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
