<p> Clothes are my passion. There's nothing like buying a new outfit or top and feeling your best in it. I'll never understand people who don't care about clothes or shopping. Clothes to me are so fun and they express who we are. I'm constantly adding to my wardrobe new favorites because styles and trends are always changing.
<p> Go Jane is an online clothing website that sells very affordable items for women. Whether you're looking for a cute top, great fall boots, or dangly earrings, they have it all and more. The clothes are very trendy and what you'd see in a department store but cost half the money.
<p> Looking for a birthday gift for your sister, daughter, granddaughter, or niece? Look no further than GoJane. Get your daughter an adorable pair of skinny jeans, or how about a pretty necklace too? You'll have no trouble finding the perfect gift.
<p> I did a previous review for GoJane back in May and I loved the dress they sent me, so I knew I needed to do another review soon! I was sent a fabulous pair of skinny jeans for review.
<p> Solid color five pocket skinny jeans designed with contrast stitch detail, finished with button tab-zipper closure on the front.
<p> I really love these jeans. They fit me wonderfully and I love the dark wash of them. They easily fit into my boots and rainboots, and they also look great with flats or heels. What I love most about skinny jeans is that they are so versatile and look great with practically anything you pair them with. The bottom of the jeans easily rolls up to cuff them over if wearing with flats. The jeans are comfortable and are not tight on my legs at all. I will be wearing them with a lot of cute tops and sweaters this fall and winter! :)

<p> I'm the kind of person who wants everything in the kitchen to match and have an according place. I don't like mismatched silverware or a random plate that doesn't fit in with the matching set. I'm kind of a kitchen nerd in that aspect. It gives me great pride to have everything together in one set in my kitchen.
<p> Oneida is a housewares company which offers flatware, dinnerware, cookware, bakeware, drinkware, and more. They have quality items that are built to last. They have something for everyone's taste and style. I've browsed their product pages and have loved a lot of what I've seen. An item or two from Oneida would make the perfect gift for someone who has just moved into a new house, or for someone's first apartment.
<p> I have previously done a review for Oneida's cookware. I was very impressed with their cookware that I knew I needed to review more of Oneida's products.
<p> My flatware is old and is definitely in need of an upgrade. I knew that I needed to replace it, but couldn't find a pattern in the stores that I liked. I stumbled upon Oneida's flatware section on their website and was so happy with each pattern that I saw.
<p> I knew that I wanted something modern and pretty but not so elegant that I felt like I was hosting a Christmas dinner party.
<p> I finally settled on the beautiful Satin Aquarius pattern. Oh, I love it so much!Satin Aquarius strikes a balance between classic and modern style, intertwining graceful ropes of satin and polished 18/10 stainless steel. Dishwasher safe.
<p> Isn't it just gorgeous? I'm so happy to have a high-quality flatware set. I love the twisted rope pattern, it's very modern which is just my style. The utensils are not too heavy at all, a perfect weight I might add. I touched a few of the utensils to see how fingerprint-prone they are, and honestly I could barely see a fingerprint at all on them! The stainless steel is produced well and very high quality. The silver definitely sparkles and it looks fantastic in my silverware drawer. I can't wait to use these for dinner tonight. I'm sure this set will last me quite a number of years.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thanks to Oneida for providing me this flatware set in exhange for my review. All thoughts and opinions are solely mine.

<p> Along with chocolate, bread is my other weakness in life. Hand me a basket of fresh out of the oven rolls and a little dish of butter and I'll love you forever. There's nothing like homemade bread especially when it's made with love. Sourdough and asiago cheese bread are my absolute favorites. Mm, I think it's time to make some bread!
<p> The prestigious Cuisinart brand is not limited to food processors. Plugged or unplugged, nobody covers the kitchen like Cuisinart. The company is a full-service culinary resource with a wide array of products, preferred by chefs and favored by consumers. Cuisinart offers kitchen appliances such as toasters, waffle makers, blenders, food choppers and food processors, deep fryers, coffee makers, microwaves, and much more. Cuisinart's beautiful range of products will keep your kitchen running properly.
<p> I've been a fan of Cuisinart's products for years. I have their microwave, blender, waffle maker, and food chopper. When I go to the home section of Macy's, I'm drawn to the Cuisinart section of the department like a fly to a bug zapper. It's a sickness I'm pretty sure. The appliances are beautiful and so well made.
<p> Cuisinart sent me a 2 lb convection bread maker for review.
<p> The various features the machine has
<p> Now Cuisinart does it for you! Their versatile bread maker offers a variety of crust colors and loaf sizes, and 12 preprogrammed menu options. Foolproof recipes include low carb and gluten-free breads, as well as jams and sauces. With a convenient 13-hour delay start timer, that wonderful aroma of just-baked bread can be waiting for you when you walk in the door.
<p> Like some other bread machines on the market this one has a power failure backup feature. Should the power to the bread machine be disrupted it will store in memory the stage of bread making cycle and resume once the power is restored. However, unlike some other bread machines this backup feature is good for only 15 minutes. If the power stays out for longer than that you are out of luck.
<p> I've been eyeing a Cuisinart breadmaker for a while now but never went through with the purchase for some reason. When I had the chance to receive the breadmaker I was very excited. I've been using a breadmaker for years but the one I have is older and the features are not up to 2011. I was happy to have a breadmaker that has the features and settings needed to create delicious and aromatic loaves of bread.
<p> The breadmaker is simply beautiful. I love stainless steel so the design is sleek and modern and right up my alley, even though stainless steel shows fingerprints like crazy. It comes with a recipe book which has probably close to 100 assorted machine ready recipes. My favorite thing about the book is that the ingredients for the recipe are separated into 2 pound, 1 1/2 pound, and 1 pound loaf. It makes it much easier so you don't have to guess if you want to make a larger or smaller loaf. The buttons on the machine are easy to use and operate and you can select exactly what you want effortlessly. What's great is that you can set the breadmaker to go to work and you can go about with your day while that fantastic loaf bakes!
<p> I flipped through the recipe book gazing at all of the mouth-watering breads and decided to settle on making a 1 pound French bread loaf. I wanted to start off easy because I'm still a novice at baking bread. I also didn't want to make a recipe that was too hard in case I messed it up and wasted ingredients.
<p> I put all my ingredients in the machine, pushed the according buttons, and then pressed start. The machine is digital which is a lot easier than manual buttons that you just push for your selection. The machine started kneading that delicious bread into a thick dough. The machine was relatively quiet and I could barely hear it from the kitchen. When the machine beeped the instructions told me to reshape the dough and then continue the cycle. I really liked that the machine had a viewing window, so I could watch the cycle and see the machine work its magic. The smell of delicious bread wafted through my house as the bread baked.
<p> Ingredients ready to be kneaded:
<p> I recorded a video of the bread kneading but it won't upload into Blogger :(
<p> About 3 hours later a gorgeous loaf of French bread emerged from the doors of heaven, oops I mean my breadmaker. The exterior was perfectly crunchy and delightfuly airy while the inside was moist and chewy. Yum! This bread tasted like I had just purchased it from a fine bakery, certainly not made by me! I had slight trouble with getting the loaf out of the machine. Next time I think I will spray non-stick cooking spray inside. It was definitely a delicious piece of bread. I had a small piece that I slathered a thin layer of butter on. The butter quickly melted into the bread and it was fantastic! Apple butter or jelly spread on the bread would make a great treat too.
<p> Look at the top of this piece of bread, doesn't it look amazing?
<p> This breadmaker would make the perfect gift for that foodie in your life, or you can treat yourself too! Who wouldn't want to have delicious loaves of bread on hand for sandwiches at all times for your family?
<p> *Disclosure* I received this breadmaker complimentary from Cuisinart. All thoughts and opinions are solely mine.

<p> Fall is almost here and it's time to break out the cooler weather clothes. Even though the warm weather is gone, you can still look great in the cold months of the year. Gaiam is here to help you look sophisticated yet stylish at the same time.
<p> Gaiam knows that positive change comes from within. Their focus on personal development, health &amp; wellness and global consciousness shows us the path to transformation. At Gaiam you’ll find inspirational media and solutions for healthy living, environmental wellness and renewal of spirit.

Whether you're looking for a cardio DVD or a new set of towels for your bathroom, they have you covered. A gift certificate to Gaiam would be a great gift for a friend or relative.
<p> I was sent a gorgeous green Pointelle knit cardigan.
<p> A fresh update to their bestselling Scarf-Front Cardigan! Sophisticated and modern, this open sweater in a pretty pointelle pattern has a flowing, shawl-style front and scooped back to add movement and drama. Slightly tapered at the waist. 53% organic cotton, 47% rayon made from sustainable bamboo. Dry clean only.
<p> I love this cardigan! The shade of beautiful green is perfect for winter. It would look beautiful with a nice pair of black or brown boots and jeans with a long sleeve shirt underneath. I like how the cardigan wraps around me and flows. The cardigan fits me very well in the shoulders and arms. Although I am 5'0 it is longer than expected, but I think when I wear boots with a heel the height should balance out the length of the cardigan. The pattern of the cardigan is really unique and fun. It seems like it is made with high quality materials and will last through a few winters. I can't wait to wear it when it starts getting chillier!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a green Pointelle knit cardigan in their choice of size from Gaiam.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Cooking is a big passion of mine. I cook 4 to 5 times a week and I always love using new cookware and kitchen gadgets to experiment with. I feel that the pan you use makes such a difference in the cooking process. You don't want to use low quality cookware to make a beautiful meal with. Xtrema provides beautiful cookware for you to cook your little heart out with.
<p> Xtrema Cookware offers cookware that not only looks great but withstands high temperatures and heat. The products are constructed with high quality materials and are durable and built to last.
<p> Xtremely durable: cooking surface can not be scratched, even by metal utensils and industrial steel wool
<p> Whether you're looking for a sauce pot, wok, ceramic sauce pan, or even a skillet set Xtrema has you covered and more.
<p> I was sent a beautiful 9" Xtrema Flair non-stick skillet.
<p> 9" Non-Stick Flair Skillet- Their new flair skillets have a ceramic non-scratch, gloss black finish outside and a 100% non-stick PFOA free inside coating. The skillets have a unique shape which makes it very convenient to easy slide your food onto your plate.
<p> This skillet is truly awesome. I used it this morning to make an omelet for breakfast. First of all, I love that the pan comes with a silicone cover so you don't burn yourself. I've had my fair share of holding pot handles and thinking that wouldn't be that hot and I was very wrong! It's nice that a company takes a consumer's comfort and safety into account. The handle was comfortable to hold and was not heavy at all.
<p> My omelet cooking.
<p> With my other pans if I turn the heat up too high my food will burn and the bottom of the pan burns. I knew that this pan could withstand high heats so I turned up the gas as high as possible to experiment. I watched my delicious cheese omelet cook into a gorgeous golden yellow half-moon shape. The omelet did not burn or char at all! I was truly impressed that this pan could go where no other pan had gone before and come out alive! The pan is like magic. The bottom of the pan was perfectly intact with no black marks at all. The omelet cooked evenly and completely and it was cooked very fast too.
<p> My omelet's done in this picture. Notice that there is barely any food residue on the actual bottom of the pan but only on the sides?
<p> The best part of this pan is that the food slides out with ease because of the shape of the pan. I didn't even spray Pam into the pan before cooking because I wanted to see how well the non-stick coating worked. I slid my omelet onto my plate practically effortlessly and there was barely any food residue left in the pan afterwards. I've had pans before where egg and cheese residue was left in the pan and it was a pain to get out. The pan is dishwasher safe which is a nice added bonus. I highly recommend Xtrema for any of your future cooking needs.

<p> Steam cleaning is the perfect form of cleaning without worrying about your health. What's better than avoiding harsh fumes and ingesting chemicals then cleaning with steam that sanitizes? It's also much easier and convenient to carry around one machine than several rags and cleaners.
<p> Steam Cleaners Plus is proud to offer green cleaning products: home steam cleaners, floor steam cleaners, handheld steam cleaners, and portable steam cleaners. Each vapor steam cleaner will assist you in cleaning chemical free. Choose to make a difference by living a healthier, eco-friendly life. Live healthy. Be happy. Go green - clean with steam.
<p> Steam Cleaners Plus offers fabulously priced steam cleaners to make every room of your house shine and sparkle like new.
<p> I was sent the Steamdart Handheld Steam Cleaner for review. I was very excited to receive this cleaner because I have very long hallways and it's hard for me to get into the nooks and crannies of the wall. The steam cleaner came with special attachments that will make cleaning effortlessly easy now! Steam cleaners also make a great gift.
<p> Easy Assembly &amp; StorageCompact, handheld size
<p> 12 Included AttachmentsLightweight &amp; Easy To UseNo Strain Handle
<p> Up to 25 Minutes of OperationDeep Cleaning Results
<p> ETL listed. Conforms to UL Std 499
<p> Durable Steam Cleaning ToolsThe steam jet nozzle can be attached directly to the SteamDart base or to the extension hose for extended reach. Four high quality brushes are included: 1 short nylon brush, 1 long nylon brush, 1 scrub pad and 1 brass brush. The Bent Nozzle (shown below brushes) allows you to direct steam into hard to reach places penetrating germs and grime.
<p> Steam Clean Clothing, Upholstery and MoreThe SteamDart handheld steamer can also be used to steam clothing and upholstery using the large steam nozzle and included terry cloth. The squeegee attachment is perfect for glass surfaces and the large utility brush attachment has nylon bristles for when the job requires a little scrubbing action.
<p> I received this product today and couldn't wait to start using it! The steam cleaner is a cute bright yellow color that stands out from the mundane black and white steam cleaners that are generally available. I love that it comes with a range of different accessories and attachments to clean with. The provided funnel cup comes in handy as to prevent spills when filling the unit with water.
<p> The directions were easy to understand and follow and in no time I had the unit filled up, turned on, and in 2 minutes it was ready to use. I selected the rounded nozzle tool for just general cleaning. When you want steam to come out, you press a button on the unit to stop and start it. What's great about this is that you control the steam and it doesn't continuously run and waste water and power. I was not expecting the steam to be so powerful! It actually blew off the attachment I had on it because it wasn't on secure enough. I love that the steam is powerful because it sort of "power steams" the surface that you're cleaning. I used the steam cleaner in my living room. I instantly blasted my glass coffee table with sanitizing steam. Upon touching the table right after it was not hot at all. There was also no yucky excessive water residue left over like some steam cleaners have. I blasted my living room floors with the same attachment as I used on the table and I loved watching the steam coat my floor in a fabulous blanket of sanitization! The unit was easy to carry around and it was not heavy at all. I do wish the cord was longer so you can do two rooms at once without having to plug the cleaner into another outlet.
<p> I can't wait to use this unit in the rest of my house. It's actually addicting to use and I really feel that it cleaned my living room well. This unit makes cleaning fun! I love how versatile it is and how there are so many different attachments for satisfying your different cleaning needs. It's also very convenient as it doubles as a clothes steamer too! How about multi-tasking by steaming your floors and then your dress?
<p> This would make the perfect gift for an elderly person who has trouble bending over to scrub the floors with a regular mop. Now they don't have to bend over and they can enjoy knowing cleaning doesn't have to be a painful chore for them.

<p> My hair needs all the hydration and nourishment it can possibly have. I've been dying my hair since I was 12, so you can believe that its had its fair share of processing and chemicals. Granted my hair is relatively healthy, I can't brush it out after a shower unless I condition it. If I don't condition it, it is very brittle and looks dry and ugly and is hard to brush out. Having perfectly straight and smooth hair has been a dream of mine for a while.
<p> Keratin Earth uses a unique combination of natural ingredients to straighten and soften all hair types, including even the most coarse, dry and color-treated hair. The product was developed by women for women and Keratin Earth addressed all of the complaints that the brand heard from their friends about expensive salon straightening and complicated, ineffective at-home hair treatments. With real women's feedback in mind, they ensured that Keratin Earth not only offers salon quality results without harsh chemical, but also smells great, is affordable and incredibly easy to use.
<p> The Keratin Earth system is a simple, four-step process. Each kit contains a 6 oz Keratin straightening therapy, 8 oz clarifying shampoo and an 8 oz conditioner. A 2 oz conditioning mask is also included. First the hair is shampooed and conditioned. Then, one applies the straightening therapy to the hair and leaves it for up to 20 minutes. The treatment is washed out with the shampoo, and leave in conditioner is applied. Hair can then be blow dried and flat ironed for maximum straightening results.
<p> I was excited to share this review with everyone because I'm sure my readers struggle with not loving how their hair looks at certain times. Some hair is more easily manageable than others. Keratin will make any hair beautiful! :)
<p> This system was very easy to use. The instructions were simple to follow and understand which was really nice. Each bottle was labeled with the according number for each step of the process which was convenient.
<p> This is a before picture of my hair. You can see that I have some waves at the ends of my hair that I am not a big fan of.
<p> The entire process took about 20 minutes to do. The products did not have a harsh chemical smell at all and smelled actually very pleasant. The shampoo lathered up nicely and rinsed out easily. The straightening therapy was easy to apply to my hair and I combed it through with ease. I left it on for 10 minutes instead of 20 because I don't have coarse or thick hair. Once I rinsed that out I towel dried my hair and applied a leave in conditioner. Then, I blow dried it to where it was almost completely dry. I instantly noticed it was shinier and much more healthy looking. Lastly, I flat ironed my hair to complete the straightening process. I absolutely loved the way my hair looked and I could definitely notice a difference.
<p> Check out the after picture.
<p> I really love the results. My hair is managable, soft, shiny, and looks incredibly healthy. It's also much straighter too! I've used hot oils and leave in conditioners before and have never achieved as great results as I have with this Kertain treatment. I am truly satisfied with the product and will definitely be recommending it to my friends and family. It's also much more convenient to use the products at home than it is to spend a lot of time in the salon. This is a great product to have to pamper yourself and it would make the perfect gift too!

<p> I'm headed to PA tomorrow for a Musselman blogger's trip with some other well known bloggers! I'm very excited. :) When I get back on Tuesday I'll be picking winners and adding more reviews/giveaways. I'll be sure to post some pictures from my trip.
<p> Changing technology is something the world is accustomed to. Developers are always coming out with the latest tool or electronic gadget to make our lives easier. iPads are truly changing the world and they are now a way of life. We check our email on them, read the news or a book on them, listen to music, play games, and more. Now some schools across the country are loaning iPads to students so they can read their required text-book readings on them. Just like we care how our computers look, why not make your iPad stylish too?
<p> Hard Candy Cases offers stylish and premium cases for the iPad 1, iPad 2, iPod, iPhone, Macbook and tablets. Whether you're looking for a black squish skin case for your iPad, or a bubble slider soft touch case for your iPhone, they have you covered. I love that the cases are fun and come in many different colors. A Hard Candy case would make the perfect gift for someone who has just purchased an iPad or iPod.
<p> I was sent 3 different cases for my first generation iPad to review. I received a pink bubble sleeve, a pink sleek skin case, and pink squish skin case. I really like that I'll have different styles of cases to switch my iPad around in. Variety is the spice of life, right? I think I might have overdone it on every case being pink, but I do love the color! :)
<p> Features•Fits the Apple iPad 2 and the Apple iPad 1•Sleek, molded exterior that's still soft to the touch•Shock absorbing rubber bumpers to stabilize and protect your iPad•EVA-molded, rigid case provides more secure protection than a neoprene sleeve•Zippered case allows use of your iPad in or out of its sleeve
<p> This case is great! It's the perfect size for fitting in my purse with no problems. The color is bright and vibrant and pink is always such a fun color. The material of the case is rough, which means it's durable and can protect my iPad from damage and scratches while inside. The bubbles on the case add an element of fun. My iPad fits perfectly inside and the rubber bumpers on the 4 walls help keep it in place. The zippers on the case close and open easily. Usually I don't take my iPad out of its case when I use it so I can prevent fingerprints on it etc. The iPad is easy to use when inside the bubble case which is nice. Some cases make it The only two things I wish this case had was a pocket inside, and cut outs on the outside of the case for access to charging it.
<p> Sleek Skin case:
<p> The Hard Candy Sleek Skin iPad Case is constructed of exceptionally shock-absorbing TPU rubber that won't stretch or surrender. This iPad case's integrated screen cover snaps onto the front or back of your iPad when not in use, making the Sleek Skin iPad case the most versatile choice in functional iPad protection.
<p> This case took me a minute to get it on my iPad completely because I wasn't used to the rubber. I like that the rubber is extremely durable and keeps my iPad secure and free from damage. It wasn't as hard to take the case off as it was to put it on. I've had silicone cases before and the silicone got really nasty and gross, so I'm happy that the rubber will be easier to clean. This is the first case that I've owned that has a screen protector which is really nice. The screen is so susceptible to fingerprints, and dirt and dust, so it's great that someone took that into consideration and wanted to protect the screen too. When you want to use the iPad, just simply peel back the screen protector to have access. When you're done, put the protector back in place and your iPad is protected again. I like that there's access to full media controls so I don't have to take my iPad out of the case to charge it. The case is too big to fit in my purse for everyday use, but it is perfect for throwing in my suitcase if I'm traveling somewhere.
<p> Squish Skin case:
<p> More protective than bubble wrap and way more fun, the Squish Skin iPad case delivers noticeably outstanding and unique protection for your iPad. The snug, form-fitting silicone skin resists impacts by utilizing air-filled chambers just below the surface of the iPad case.
<p> This case is probably my favorite. It has an extremely snug fit to the iPad protecting it 100% from any damage and impact. I love the squishy feel of it and I find myself playing with it constantly, lol. It's a very unique material. If I accidently happen to drop my iPad while it is in this case I won't have to worry because any impact will be protected since it is so durable. The color of the case is bright and vivid and I really love it. Like the last case, since this is also silicone it took me a minute to properly fit it on. Once the case was on though I didn't have any other problems with it. I do wish it had a screen protector too. I like that this case allows full access to media controls too. It's a pain to take iPads out of their cases to charge. This case is also too big to fit in my purse but would be good to bring with you to travel with if you're flying or driving somewhere.
<p> Thanks to Hard Candy my iPads will be constantly stylin'!

<p> Memories are a precious thing. We want to make sure we capture every important memory on either film or video. You want to have a picture of your family reunion, your daughter's first day of kindergarten, family trips, and anything else that you hold dear to your heart. The first step in capturing those memories is having a stylish camera to make those memories a reality.
<p> Fujifilm was established in 1934 with the aim of producing photographic films. Over the decades they have diversified into new markets and built a strong presence around the globe. Fujifilm's motto is simple: They are working in many areas from digital cameras to motion picture film, and computer media to medical imaging — to bring you better products, solve difficult problems and protect our planet's environment.
<p> I have been using Fujifilm products for years. I used to use their film cameras many years ago. When film cameras made the switch into digital cameras, you can guarantee that I purchased a Fujifilm digital camera. I trust their brand for reliability, dependability, and quality products.
<p> Cameras make a great gift for anyone of any age. Who wouldn't want a beautiful picture of the beaches in Hawaii to remember a fantastic try by? Cameras are becoming ever changing pieces of technology by the day. New and impressive features are being added constantly. Why not have a state of the art camera to take the best pictures possible with?
<p> One lucky winner will win a Fujifilm prize package including a red z90 Fufjilm touch screen camera, a pink paisley camera case, and a 4 GB SD card. Wouldn't this make an awesome Christmas present? How about an early Christmas present for you too!
