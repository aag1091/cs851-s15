<p> Sweets and desserts are something that I absolutely love! I eat chocolate a few times a week, I just can't get enough of it. I'm trying to eat less of it though. I'm the kind of girl who loves "busy" chocolate, which is why FunkyChunky is right up my alley.
<p> If you have never tried Funky Chunky gourmet snacks, just one bite of our sinful confections will have you melting in delight. What makes them so deliciously tempting? We hand-drizzle popcorn, pretzel twists and other premium ingredients with a signature combination of white, milk and dark chocolates, then break them into mouth-watering chunks. At FunkyChunky products are hand-crafted with no trans-fats. MMM, doesn't that sound amazing? I love that the snacks have so much packed into one bite.
<p> I was in chocolate heaven when I received this package. So far I have only tried the Chip-Zel-Pop. I've been wanting to try chocolate covered potato chips for a while so I was excited to be able to try this. The Chip-Zel-Chip has potato chips, pretzels, popcorn, caramel and chocolate in it. Looking at the snack truly was a work of art. The caramel popcorn was large and fluffy. It was chock full of rich, sweet caramel flavor. I loved the chocolate covered chips and pretzels in the mix. The combination of sweet and salty is fabulous and decadently rich. The pretzels and chips provided a fantastic crunch and were drizzled with chewy caramel that was heavenly. The snack was topped with layers of three chocolates: dark, milk &amp; white. The many different layers of lusciously sweet chocolate were fantastically amazing. This snack truly is a chocolate lover's dream and I loved every second of eating it!

<p> I regularly eat sandwiches for lunch. They are easy, quick, and delicious. There's so many different varieties that you can make that the idea of a sandwich never gets tiring. Land O'Frost has made your life easier by bringing the sandwich to you all in one setting!
<p> Land O'Frost is the largest privately held sliced lunchmeat brand in the country. The company was started by a Dutch immigrant in the 50's. Land O'Frost offers any lunchmeat that you could want for a sandwich.
<p> A new thing that Land O'Frost is offering is lunch kits. The kit contains a wrap, a select type of meat, and a select type of cheese. Everything comes in one kit, you just have to add condiments and whatever else you'd like on the sandwich.
<p> I was sent oven roasted turkey and pepperjack cheese and black forest ham and swiss. Each kit contains 25 slices of Land O’Frost lunchmeat, five slices of cheese and five tortillas to make 5 sandwiches. The food items are specially separated in each kit for easy use. I like that each kit zips closed for guaranteed freshness after use.
<p> The biggest thing that I like about this kit is that it offers the wrap to you without any hesitation. You don't have to think what cheese would go great with this meat, or what kind of bread do I want to use for the sandwich, etc. Everything is made for you already.
<p> I do not eat ham, so I will not be using the ham kit at all. I did use the cheese from it though. I made my first wrap the other day. I was curious at how everything would taste since it was not all bought together. The wrap was nice, it was not overly thin but had just the right amount of thickness to it. I added a few slices of turkey to it, and one slice of cheese. The turkey had a nice oven roasted flavor to it and the pepperjack cheese was great too. The cheese had a perfect kick to it to give the wrap some pizazz. Turkey and cheese always goes well together and it's such a classic combination. I did substitute the pepperjack cheese for swiss the other day and that was also very good. I would possibly add bacon to the wrap for a nice added crunch too. These kits are great for preparing a quick wrap on the go to bring to lunch or school. You could also bring them on a car trip too if you're going hiking or camping.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TWO (2) winner for this contest. Two winners will win two wrap kits from Land O'Frost. They will receive one black forest ham and swiss, and one oven roasted turkey and pepperjack cheese.

<p> Comfort foods provide you with a warm sense of life and happiness. Foods on this level are best shared with a group of friends over great conversation and lots of laughs. Alexia's products definitely fit this category well and they are quality products.
<p> Alexia offers all natural foods, trans fat free foods, organic foods, flavorful appetizers and premium artisan blends of items. Once you try Alexia, you will be hooked! The foods are rich and full of flavor and certainly not lacking on delicious taste.
<p> I've tried many of Alexia's products in the past and they are nothing short of awesome! The fries are crispy and crunchy, and the bread flavorful and delicious.
<p> Alexia has rolled out with a new product this time that I knew I had to try! What is it, you ask? Well sweet potato puffs! These are similiar to tater tots, but they are made with sweet potato instead of regular potatoes.
<p> I served these with a nice piece of fish and a salad the other night and the puffs went perfectly with both items! The puffs are really easy to cook. Just place them on a cookie sheet and pop them into the oven on 400F for 18-22 minutes. I know it might be hard to wait that long because the puffs are truly delicious, but you will have to. :) Once the puffs are done, they are ready to eat! The only mistake I made was that I didn't cook them long enough (I only cooked them for 20 minutes) so they weren't as crispy on the outside as they could have been. They were still good but now I know to cook them an extra minute longer for next time.
<p> The puffs are a perfect burnt orange color and they smelled awesome. I love Alexia's sweet potato fries so I knew that I would love these puffs. The puffs were crunchy (albeit not as crunchy as possible) on the outside and perfectly warm and fluffy on the inside. The sweet potato was very flavorful and great and they did not at all taste like they were frozen 20 minutes prior in my freezer! These puffs make a great side dish for chicken, steak, or any other poultry you'd like to serve it with. These are a healthy alternative to tater tots and kids will love these as will your whole family. What are you waiting for? Serve some sweet potato puffs today!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a bag of Alexia sweet potato puffs.

<p> Jewelry is something that I never leave home without. Everyday I wear earrings, rings, and sometimes a necklace or bracelet. I'm always on the lookout for new jewelry when I go shopping because I love to accessorize. I love big chunky, dangly jewelry too, that's my favorite style of jewelry.
<p> ChunkyBling makes beaded watch bands, bracelets, rings and necklace charm clusters. All of their jewelry is hand crafted and made to order. Looking for that special gift for a friend? How about a custom watch that you can build yourself? You can also customize your own necklace with chains and charms that you create! The jewelry at ChunkyBling is gorgeous and the best part is nobody else will have the same ring or necklace as you!
<p> I was sent a Swarovski pearl mystic black ring.
<p> Information about the ring: We're thrilled to introduce our new line of Swarovski crystal rings! These hand-crafted rings are made of silver plated beads, rhinestones and genuine Swarovski crystals. They are strung on durable stretch cord, so the sizing is flexible, and the rings are comfortable.
<p> This ring is very pretty! You have to be careful when you wear it though because it's on a stretch cord. I love that this is hand crafted rather than bought in a store, it's more unique that way. I really like the combination of the black, silver, and rhinestones together, it's a great mix. Each ring is available in two sizes. I picked a size 5-6 but since it's stretchy, it could easily fit someone who is a bigger 5 or 6 than me. I like that the ring isn't a strict size but would fit anyone in that size range. The rhinestones are very pretty and they actually sparkle in the light. The ring fits me very well and is very light! It's so comfortable that I barely notice I'm wearing it at all. The black stones are shiny and reflect nicely in the light too. I am really happy with this ring. It's great for night or day wear and will blend in great with whatever you're wearing!
<p> I'm an avid picture-taker. I see the beauty in so many things and I love to always have my camera with me to capture those images. Any party, trip, or fun time I'm going to, you can bet that I'll always have my camera with me.
<p> Fujifilm was established in 1934 with the aim of producing photographic films. Over the decades they have diversified into new markets and built a strong presence around the globe. Fujifilm's motto is simple: They are working in many areas from digital cameras to motion picture film, and computer media to medical imaging — to bring you better products, solve difficult problems and protect our planet's environment.
<p> I have been using Fujifilm products for years. I used to use their film cameras many years ago. When film cameras made the switch into digital cameras, you can guarantee that I purchased a Fujifilm digital camera. I trust their brand for reliability, dependability, and quality products.
<p> Fujufilm recently announced its new 2011 line of digital camera accessory cases, which range in colors and styles, and include quilted fashion cases, bowler-style bags and two rugged traditional bags for FinePix digital cameras. I loved the styles and colors and knew I had to get my hands on one for my camera! I have been using a hot pink case for my camera for a year or so, but I was growing tired of it and wanted to spice up the case!
<p> I was sent a Fujifilm Paisley case for review.
<p> I absolutely love this case! It's adorable and the print is so fun and colorful. Paisley is awesome because no print of it is alike, each design is always so different and original. I was worried when I first received the case that my camera wouldn't fit inside because the case is very small. It was not a problem though and my camera fits perfectly! The inside pattern is a pretty pattern of orange, green, yellow, white, and pink stripes. It reminds me of summer. The case comes with a wrist strap which is handy to use it you're on vacation and you want to keep your camera close to you, especially if you're taking a lot of pictures. The case zips closed and there is a handy pocket on the outside. The pocket would be great for putting some cash in, or even an extra memory chip if you're planning on taking a lot of pictures where ever you go. Thanks to Fujifilm my camera will have an awesome new case!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a paisley camera case from Fujifilm.

<p> Brownies are one of the best desserts ever. Forget ice cream, cookies, or even cake. While all of those are great, nothing beats a warm, delicious, fudgy brownie. YUM! Sometimes you need to take a second out of life and enjoy something sweet and tasty.
<p> Laura's Brownies are baked by Laura herself using her secret recipe. Laura’s Brownies can be delivered anywhere. The brownies are packaged in gift boxes and tins for all occasions—from a single brownie to a five-pound box of joy. They make great party treats and perfect holiday gifts!
<p> Are you looking for a gift for a family member or friend, but don't know what to get? Look no further than Laura's Brownies! They offer fantastic marshmallow brownies, caramel brownies, chocolate chippers, biscotti, lemon bars, gluten free brownies, and so much more! Anyone who has a sweet tooth will love a fantastic treat from Laura's!
<p> I was sent a tin filled with fantastic marshmallow and caramel brownie bites. I was expecting full sized brownies, but the small pieces are even better!
<p> Don't these look simply heavenly? I think perhaps these brownies are the gateway to heaven!
<p> I liked that the tin I received was filled with small brownie bites, it made me feel less guilty for indulging rather than knowing I was eating a whole brownie at once.
<p> I couldn't wait to get my hot little hands on the caramel brownie first. I popped in a brownie bite into the microwave on high for about 10 seconds. When I opened the microwave door I could smell the sweet caramel and luscious chocolate. It smelled like I had been baking, but the microwave did all of the work! I poured myself a cold glass of milk and settled in to give my taste buds something to thank me for. The brownie was dense and packed full of wonderful chocolate and caramel. I took a bite and it was pure bliss. I swear the whole world stopped when I consumed that first bite. It was like no brownie I ever had before. The chocolate was rich and delicious and the caramel wonderfully flavorful and sweet. Chocolate and caramel together are such a timeless, classic combination. You cannot go wrong when pairing the two. The brownie was warm, and the caramel was gooey and it was just melt in your mouth fantastic. Laura really knows how to make a brownie! These brownies would also be just as wonderful cold in an ice cream sundae too!
<p> The next day I tried the marshmallow brownie. I am a huge lover of marshmallows so I knew that this brownie would be right up my alley. I much prefer brownies warmed up then "cold", so I zapped it in the microwave for a few seconds. I anxiously counted down the seconds until my marshmallow and chocolate treat was done. The microwave beeped and I couldn't get to the microwave fast enough! The brownie was perfectly warm and the marshmallow was slightly melted, the perfect combination. The brownie itself was dense and had a marshmallow topping with a chocolate drizzle on top. The brownie was almost too pretty to eat, but hey who am I kidding? I would never turn down a brownie! I took a bite and prepared myself to enter the world of chocolate bliss. The brownie was sweet, dense, and full of fantastic chocolate flavor. The marshmallow topping was quite unique. I don't think I've ever had marshmallow inside or on top of a brownie before. It gave the brownie a sweet and fluffy edge, which I really enjoyed. The brownie was simply divine to say the least. I could have easily had 2 or 3 more but I had to control myself!
<p> I highly recommend you try Laura's Brownies if you haven't already, they will change the way you eat brownies forever!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1.. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a tin filled with Laura's Brownies. The flavors will be marshmallow and caramel.

<p> Pizza is something that I'm a huge fan of. My ultimate pizza would be a deep dish with a blend of four cheeses, pepperoni, and sausage. Mmm, my mouth is watering right now! I'm not extremely adventurous with pizza toppings. I stick to what I like and what tastes good. :)
<p> Red Baron produces many different delicious types of pizza such as pan pizza, french bread pizza, fire baked pizza, thin crust pizza, supreme pizza and more. Whether you're looking for a sausage and cheese pizza, pepperoni and cheese pizza, or many toppings on one pizza, Red Baron is the king of pizza, and they do it right!
<p> As you may know, Red Baron and Howie Mandel teamed up for a new online video series to pit delivery pizza and Red Baron against each other to show Americans which pan pizza option is the “Real Deal” when it comes to quality, taste and convenience.

<p> I'm a cheese fanatic. A delicious piece of cheese bursting with flavor on a cracker is something that I enjoy often. The little things in life make me happy and why not stop and enjoy life with fabulous cheese?
<p> Mini Babybel is known for its unique packaging which consists of a netted bag in which each piece is encased in red wax. Numerous flavors of Mini Babybel are offered across the world. The original Mini Babybel, a Dutch Edam variety, is encased in red wax. There are currently eight flavors offered in the U.S.: Original, Sharp Original, Light, Bonbel, Cheddar, White Cheddar, Swiss, and Gouda.
<p> I’ve always loved Mini Babybel cheeses. They are perfect for throwing in a lunch or bringing them to work for a quick snack. The cheeses are encased in a unique red wax packaging that is very fun to peel too.
<p> Mini Babybel has two new flavors, Sharp Original, and White Cheddar. They sounded delicious and I knew I had to try them!
<p> (What the cheese looks like inside the wax.)
<p> I sampled the White Cheddar flavor first. As I unwrapped the plastic packaging, I knew that the key to my cheesy heart awaited in the red wax packaging. I slowly peeled away the wax casing and the most delicious circle of creamy White Cheddar cheese greeted me. I had never loved shapes as much as I did in that very second! The cheese was a perfect off white color and smelled fabulous. As I took that first bite, my mouth exploded with white cheddar flavor. The cheese was cold, creamy, fabulous, and just utterly perfect. It was smooth and rich and I savored the fantastic flavor and wished it lasted more than a few mere bites. It was the best piece of cheese I’ve had in a while. The cheese was soft and very smooth and I loved that it was creamy but also very firm too.
<p> I tried the Sharp Cheddar next. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the second round of cheese delight. As I unwrapped the wax packaging that separated me from the contestant who would win a date with my stomach, I knew that it was going to be delicious. The color was perfect and it looked fantastic and smelled even better. I took a bite and I was instantly met with the flavor of Sharp Cheddar perfection. The flavor was sharp but not too sharp, it was the pefect balance of sweet creamy cheese flavor meets heavenly cheddar flavor. I absolutely loved it! The cold creamy cheese treat was the perfect refreshing treat for a hot summer's day.
<p> The cheese is 100% natural and has no artificial additives. Each Mini Babybel cheese has 60 calories which is not bad at all. You could even splurge and have two and it wouldn't ruin your day's calories. Go ahead and treat yourself today! :)
