<p> There's nothing I like more than browsing page after page of gorgeous dresses on a company's website. I really love the beautiful colors of the dresses along with all of the intricate details of glitter, sparkles, lace, etc. My prom was well over 5 years ago now so I won't have a reason to wear another prom dress again. There's no reason why you can't wear a "plainer" prom dress to a wedding, cocktail party, or black tie event though.

Promgirl is definitely your headquarters for a gorgeous prom dress. Why not stop by the website today to secure a dress for the 2012 prom.
<p> I was sent a beautiful short gold Clarisse dress for review. The second I saw this dress I instantly fell in love with it. I knew I had to have it! I've always loved short dresses.
<p> Isn't this just such a gorgeous dress? I feel like a princess in it! The gold is very cheery, the color is rich; almost a honey color. My favorite part about the dress is the gathered empire sash waist. It's a very unique element to the dress and I like how it holds me in and makes my waist look smaller. The gold is a little bit darker on this part of the dress which is a nice contrast in comparison to the lighter gold. The tulle bottom is very fun and I like the puffiness it has. The strapless bust has a very pretty glitter detail on it that I love. The dress is the perfect cocktail length too. It fits me perfectly and is easy to zip up and down. The only thing I don't love as much about the dress is the big gold bow in the back. Overall, I really love the dress though and I can't wait to wear it to my next black tie event or wedding. The only thing I need is a new pair of gold heels to go with it!
<p> Please check out Promgirl's Facebook page as they run a free dress giveaway once a month. Register for a chance to win your dream dress!

<p> KitchenAid is one of those companies that you can depend on for life. Their products are beautiful to look at, sturdy, extremely quality made, and produce great results. I've had a KitchenAid knife block in my kitchen for years and it's still in top notch shape. If you buy a product from this company, be prepared to instantly fall in love.
<p> Since the introduction of its legendary stand mixer in 1919 and first dishwasher in 1949, KitchenAid has built on the legacy of these icons to create a complete line of products designed for cooks. Over 90 years later, the KitchenAid brand now offers virtually every essential for the well-equipped kitchen with a collection that includes everything from countertop appliances to cookware, ranges to refrigerators, and whisks to wine cellars.
<p> Any KitchenAid product would make a fabulous housewarming or wedding present. Surprise that foodie or baker in your life with a beautiful stand mixer, I can guarantee that they will want to bake you something in appreciation!
<p> I received a silver KitchenAid 5-speed hand blender for review. Even though it just arrived today, I could not wait to tear open that box and use it!
<p> I'm already in love with this hand blender and our relationship only began a mere few hours ago. I decided to whip up a batch of brownies to put this blender to work. First of all, the hand-blender is very aesthetically pleasing and I love the modern silver color of it. It is not heavy to hold at all and is actually quite comfortable. My hand wrapped around the base of it easily.
<p> I stuck the whisk attachment onto the blender base and it easily adhered. I mixed the batter along the way but once I poured the chocolate chips into my mixing bowl, that's where I wanted the hand blender to come into play. I turned the power on and put the whisk to work. The machine was surprisingly not loud at all. The motor was very quiet. The batter was very quickly whisked into a soft, smooth, and aerated creation. There were no hidden surprise unwhisked patches in the batter, everything was evenly whisked. I was worried that I would lose control of it once I turned it on and batter would go flying everywhere, but that was not the case. The machine whisks very fast and is very efficient. You can change the speed depending on your preference, but I didn't want it to whisk extremely fast. I was very, very pleased with the results. Usually I hand-whisk my brownie batter but a machine always achieves much better results. My brownies came out fabulous and had a very moist and airy taste. They were just fabulous! I will certainly be using this hand blender for any of my future mixing needs.
<p> What I really love most about this kitchen tool is the fact that it does so many jobs in one. There is a storage case which conveniently stores the blades when not in use. The blades are easy to interchange. You can puree tomato sauce for your spaghetti dinner, blend chicken noodle soup for those cold winter nights, and even chop up ingredients for your Christmas party hors d'oeuvres. Each blade is for a specific job. This tool would also be perfect for blending smoothies and frozen drinks in the summer for a refreshing treat. The hand blender doesn't take up a lot of space and since I have a small kitchen, I am very grateful for that. It stores convenient and easily in a kitchen cabinet. This kitchen appliance would make a fantastic Christmas present for a budding chef or cook in your family.
<p> A great instructional video on how to use the product.
<p> This machine truly is a dream and I honestly don't know how I never had it in my kitchen before. It is going to revolutionize my cooking and baking and I know I will depend on it for many future foods I will prepare.

<p> I love authentic NYC pizza, but sometimes you want something comforting and familiar. I grew up eating Domino's pizza and I've always had a dear spot for it in my heart. The pizza is delicious, full of flavor, and truly satisfying.
<p> Domino's offers customers a full menu to choose from, including four types of pizza crust (thin, hand-tossed, deep dish and Brooklyn Style), Domino’s American Legends®, BreadBowl Pasta, Oven Baked Sandwiches, Cheesy Bread, Breadsticks, Chicken Wings, Boneless Chicken, Chocolate Lava Crunch Cakes, CinnaStix® and Coca-Cola® products. What I love most about Domino's is that they are always adding new items to their menu to keep their customers satisfied. Domino's offers quality pizzas that are fresh, delicious, and made to please. Whether you're hanging out with family, enjoying the big game, or are wanting a quick and easy dinner, keep Domino's in mind.
<p> There's been a new addition to the Domino's menu recently with the introduction of artisan pizzas. These rectangular, thin-crust pizzas will be available in three varieties (spinach and feta, sausage and peppers, and salami and roasted vegetables.) They are made with quality ingredients and feature hand-stretched, artisan style crusts.
<p> I was able to review all 3 of the new artisan pizzas, an order of breadsticks, and an order of BBQ wings. The food actually arrived 10 minutes before it was supposed to, so it was great that the Domino's delivery workers are very prompt. I was having company over for lunch so it was helpful that I had people to help me eat the massive amount of food! The food was hot, fresh, and I couldn't wait to dig in!
<p> The BBQ wings were really delicious. I don't eat chicken wings too often but I do enjoy them when I have them. I hadn't tried Domino's version before. The BBQ sauce is layered on thick for these little pieces of BBQ heaven, so be prepared with the napkins. The chicken is flavorful, juicy, and very tender. There's a lot of meat on the bones which was a pleasant surprise. The sauce had a gorgeous, rich color to it, and the flavor of it was fantastic! It wasn't spicy at all but had a full-bodied taste. The wings came with a blue cheese dressing, but honestly it wasn't needed. My guests really enjoyed them.
<p> Oh wow, these breadsticks were extremely addictive. I forgot to take a picture before I ate one of the sticks, haha. Can you blame me though? I wanted to eat the entire box of them myself, they were that good! They had a fabulous garlic aroma which I smelled the second I opened the box. The sticks had a great texture to them. They were chewy on the outside but soft and warm on the inside, pure perfection! The breadsticks had a great garlic and herb flavor to them that I couldn't get enough of. The cornmeal sprinkled on the top and bottom was a nice added touch to round out the great appetizer or side for your meal. The sticks came with a side of marinara sauce for dipping which complimented them very well. These were a favorite at my lunch get-together.
<p> The sausage and peppers was a great Italian style pizza. The crust was thin with a great crunch to it. Since it was cut into individual squares, it was easy for everyone to grab a piece. The sausage and peppers were very fresh and tasty. The light layer of parmesan-asiago cheese was delicious and complimented the pizza well. The sausage was sliced into thick, hearty circles that were placed evenly on each piece. It had a slight kick to it, but provided a great amount of flavor too. The trio of roasted red, green, and banana peppers were cooked to absolute perfection and scattered evenly on each slice too. Sausage and peppers are a classic combination and you can never go wrong when pairing them together. The light amount of oregano dusted on top of the pizza rounded out the flavor and gave it a sophisticated boost. This was definitely a crowd favorite at lunch.
<p> This pizza is perfect for someone who loves a lot of toppings. If you're looking for a very busy pizza, this one is your king. The salami had a pleasant taste to it, nothing too overpowering. The large meaty circles were evenly placed on each slice of pizza. The garlic-parmesean sauce was very unique and I had not tried anything like it previously. It complimented the pizza well and gave it a boost of flavor. This pizza featured a great assortment of vegetables. The spinach, onions, and roasted red and banana peppers were a great combination with the salami. The veggies were scattered evenly across the pizza. All of the vegetables were very fresh and added great flavor to the pizza. The crust was cooked to a fine crisp and had a great crispy, crunchy taste. I enjoyed all of the colors featured on the pizza, it was not only a treat for the stomach but for the eyes too.
<p> The spinach and feta pizza was my absolute favorite. I asked for no onions on this pizza. The baby spinach had a perfect leafy green, vibrant color and was wilted just right. The spinach was blanketed on top of the cheese since it was the star topping. The feta cheese had a great tangy flavor that left me wanting more. The alfredo sauce was rich and layered on nicely. There was a generous amount of flavorful parmesan-asaigo cheese on the pizza too. The spinach had a great flavor and was very fresh. The crust was baked to golden perfection and even had wonderful little air bubbles in it which I loved. The spinach and feta together were pure perfection and I enjoyed each bite more than the last. I will definitely be ordering this pizza again, I wish I could have another slice right now!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* A big thank you to Domino's for providing me with the complimentary sides and artisan pizzas. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> We've been having many rainy days here in NYC lately. I don't like having to be outside if it's raining, but I do love a fabulous pair of stylish rain boots and a cute umbrella to be fashionably prepared for the weather. Umbrellas represent people's personalities, I do believe. I have a fun and cheery personality and I love an umbrella that features a colorful and bright pattern.
<p> Cheeky Umbrella shares my philosophy on adorable umbrellas. They sell awesome, trendy umbrellas that come in many different styles, sizes, and colors. There's an umbrella to fit any personality. With Cheeky Umbrella, you'll never be caught in the rain again with a boring umbrella!
<p> I've wanted a bubble umbrella for quite some time. I've never been able to find one that I really like until now. I stumbled across the fabulous clear bubble umbrella with polkadots. I knew I had to make it mine!
<p> This umbrella is so fun, I really do love it! The cute multi-colored polka dot pattern on the bottom is very whimsical. I'm glad the pattern is only on the bottom instead of on the entire umbrella, because it would take away from the clear aspect of the umbrella. The "bubble" of the umbrella is extremely large, I feel like two people could fit underneath of it! Since it's so large I know that I will be protected from the rain and be kept dry. The umbrella is not heavy to hold at all and the long handle is convenient. The material of it is very thick and durable. I actually used it today since it was raining, it was great! The umbrella was extremely sturdy against the harsh winds we had too. I've had other umbrellas where the metal spokes get damaged or mangled from the winds bending the umbrella back, but not this one. I think this umbrella will last me a while and I can't wait to use it throughout the winter!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win an umbrella of their choice from Cheeky Umbrella.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Let's talk about small kitchens, shall we? I would love a large, open kitchen that I can freely cook in without worrying about the size constraint. I dream of chopping vegetables quicker than Gordon Ramsay and making more desserts than Paula Deen can handle. New York is where big kitchens come to die though.
<p> Something along the lines of this would do just fine:
<p> I'm not even asking for a lot, I promise. My kitchen now is similiar to this size:
<p> I am not even sure what those numbers mean. It's probably a running count of everyone who went insane from having to use a kitchen that small. I also don't have a dishwasher which sends me into a fit of annoyance every time I remember that fact when I see a sink full of dirty dishes.
<p> I have two kitchen storage racks and a free standing storage cabinet, and it's still not enough room! I do have too much cookware though. I could open up my own Williams-Sonoma, I'm convinced.
<p> All of you who have gorgeous large kitchens with tons of counter and cabinet space...one day I'll be there too...I hope! :)

<p> Chocolate is everything to me. I love to bake and chocolate desserts are my specialty. I don't discriminate with my chocolate. Chocolate cakes, brownies, cookies, or even pie? I love them all! I can guarantee that going to a chocolate show will be like a chocolate heavenly dream come true.

This year’s show will also feature an exciting line up of celebrated chefs who will share their tricks of the trade in the show’s two Dacor Culinary Theaters. There will even be a Kids Zone where budding chocolate lovers can develop their palate for cocoa while creating chocolate arts and crafts.
<p> There's just something about that sweet, rich, scrumptious chocolate that I can't get enough of. This show would be perfect to take your family to, and it would also make a great gift for a friend or family member. Don't forget that foodie in your life, they would love the chance to go too!
<p> I can't even imagine how delicious the sweet treats will be at the show this year. When I try to imagine it, my head gets filled with liquid chocolate. ;) This show is fun for all ages and of course delightful for all chocolate lovers.

<p> I love the versatility of chips, they have so many different flavors and textures. There's nothing like a crunchy, sturdy chip that's dipped in a fabulous bath of french onion dip or even hummus. There's endless fantastic creamy dips that pair fabulously with a crrrrrrrrrunchy chip! Guacamole with chips is my favorite combination though.
<p> Falafel Chips uses only the highest quality ingredients. They have a passion for healthy, delicious snacks and they make the world's first falafel chips. They've packed all the delicious flavor of falafel into their healthy snacks. Their chips are organic, non-GMO, include no trans fats, and have more protein and fiber than your average chip. Did we mention they taste delicious? Try them yourself for a fresh new take on snacking!
<p> I was very intrigued by these chips. I love falafels, so I knew I would absolutely love these. I received two flavors to try; original and spicy.
<p> What I noticed immediately was the simple packaging of the bag. The packaging matches the chip's personality perfectly. That is not a bad thing at all though. The oval shaped snack has a no-frills personality and what you see is what you get. You're receiving a chip that has a fantastic crunch, great flavor, and is loved by everyone. Sometimes it's nice to enjoy something that isn't masked by a huge flavor.
<p> I did not try the spicy flavor at all because I just don't enjoy spicy foods. The original flavor was great! The chip is the perfect size and thickness for dipping and you can bet I enjoyed some hummus with them. The chip has a perfect golden toasted color which I like. The crunch of the chip (which is my favorite part) was right on par and the crunch was loud and in your face. The flavor of the chip was awesome! It was a blend of beans, vegetables, herbs, and spices. The flavors were not so intense but mixed perfectly with each other. It really did taste like a falafel which I thought was crazy to be able to put that flavor into a chip! The chip was not overly salty at all. The chip paired very well with the original creamy hummus and it was a delicious snack!
<p> I really enjoyed the chips. These chips would be perfect to serve at a party and I bet the bowl would be emptied pretty quickly. Get creative with what you serve the chips with. A 4 cheese dip or even a Mexican salsa would be perfect. Even though I am not a fan of spicy flavored snacks, many people are and I know that consumers would love them.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a case of falafel chips (6 bags original, 6 bags spicy)
<p> Winner will be chosen on October 28, 2011 at 10 pm and then will be emailed. One entry per day. Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours. Thank you and good luck!

<p> There's nothing that I love more than food that tastes delicious and has added health benefits too. You can't dip broccoli into melted chocolate, it's just not going to work. I have found a company that does work though. Their products have great nutrient benefits but taste so delicious.
<p> Supreme Protein bars are delicious, nutritious and convenient, Supreme Protein® just might be the ultimate functional food. Each sensational flavor is nutritionally designed to significantly impact your physique-enhancing goals.
<p> From its premium-quality protein blend—powered by ultra-pure whey isolate as its primary source—to the truly amazing taste, Supreme Protein® has emerged to become a leader in the protein bar market. In fact, no other product of its kind has earned more accolades and awards than this gourmet brand.
<p> With numerous major awards in the last year alone, including “Best in Category" and “Product of the Year" from major publications and retailing associations, it’s little wonder that Supreme Protein is such a runway sensation!
<p> Supreme Protein comes in a variety of flavors. If you're a chocoholic like myself, you'd probably want to try rocky road brownie, cookies and cream, caramel nut chocolate, or chocolate caramel cookie crunch. If you still want something sweet but without chocolate, why not try a peanut butter crunch bar, peanut butter pretzel twist bar, or a peanut butter and jelly bar? These bars are great for throwing in a lunch, leaving in your glove compartment in the car, or just on-the-go.
<p> I was sent three boxes of protein bars to review. I received caramel nut chocolate, peanut butter and jelly, and caramel nut chocolate. I don't regularly eat protein bars, but I only buy them when I feel like I'm not getting enough protein on consistent basis. Thanks to Supreme Protein, I'll now be stocked with enough protein to last me a lifetime--or a couple of weeks! :)
<p> What I loved most about these bars was that it didn't taste like I was eating a protein bar at all. Some protein bars taste like cardboard, but not this one! It actually felt like I was chowing down on a delicious candy bar, which of course was enjoyable for me to eat.
<p> The caramel nut chocolate bar was fantastic. It was a great size and the exterior of the bar was nothing but a glorious blanket of chocolate and dozens of nutty pieces! The color of the chocolate was utter perfection. Once you bit into the bar you were hit with a wave of sweet caramel and luscious chocolate. I also immediately tasted the fantastic crunch from the nuts. Each bite was better than the next, I absolutely loved it! It seriously tasted like candy, it was too good to actually be good for me. Was Supreme Protein playing a mean joke on me? No they weren't, it was real! This bar has 15g of protein, only 200 calories and only 2 grams of sugar too! I was surprised the sugar was so low since it's a sweet bar. If you put the bar in the fridge, it makes a great cool treat. It also has a range of key nutrients and vitamins that you need on a daily basis. The great thing about this bar is that not only are you having a sweet chocolate bar that will curb your sweet tooth, you're receiving essential nutrients that your body needs.
<p> I am not a huge fan of jelly, so I did not like this bar much. I like peanut butter sandwiches without jelly. I did appreciate the great peanut butter flavor though. This bar would be a great snack on the go for someone who doesn't have time to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The bar also has 200 calories and 15g of protein, but has 5 grams of sugar.
<p> This bar was definitely my favorite. I love the combination of salty and sweet, so this was right up my alley. The peanut butter was smooth and creamy and just perfect. The second you took a bite of the bar, you were met with the nutty taste of sweet peanut butter and the fantastic crunch provided by the salty pretzels. You also were introduced to a light layer of sweet caramel. It was just heavenly! There is a lot of pretzels packed into the compact bar because each bite had an equal crunch to the last. The caramel, peanut butter, and pretzels were fantastic when all paired together and could not be beat! The only thing that would have made this bar better would be if it was dipped in chocolate! The bar definitely satisfied my sweet tooth in a big way. It has 15g of protein and only 200 calories as well. This would also be a great frozen treat if placed in the freezer.
<p> These bars are available at CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, GNC and thousands of other retail locations. Stop by and pick one up today!

<p> Kleenex is the only brand of tissues that I depend on and turn to when I'm sick. I think many people feel that way as well. I've been using the brand for years. The tissues are comforting, soft, and protect my nose. I like that many different types of Kleenex products have been released over the years for maximum conveniency and comfort.
<p> From its beginnings in 1924, the Kleenex brand has grown into a global icon. Now a staple in homes across 150 countries, the success of their products has been based on helping people fulfill their needs for comfort, softness and cleanliness, with high-quality and gentle products. Kleenex offers many various products including anti-viral tissues, everyday tissues, ultra soft, and lotion. Kleenex also provides hand towels and dinner napkins too.
<p> I was sent a variety pack of Kleenex on the go products for review. I love Kleenex tissues. They are soft and gentle on your nose, and protect your nose from getting raw when you're sick. I also love the new design of the product packaging, it's fun and whimsical.
<p> The Kleenex brand has added a new line of on-the-go packs with Sneeze Shield this back to school season. The key is to make it easy to help keep germs off kids’ hands in the classroom, on field trips, at home or wherever kids go.
<p> The on-the-go packages include:
<p> The wallet pack. It is thin and sleek, so you can always keep a tissue on hand. Their trendy design and convenient size make it the perfect accessory for hip tweens and teens.
<p> The auto pack. It fits perfectly in the car door or glove compartment – no need to lug around a box of tissue or fumble in a purse for a tissue while driving.
<p> The new and improved pocket pack. A long-time favorite has been improved to feature three-ply tissue.
<p> The new line of Kleenex brand on-the-go products is now available in the facial tissue aisle at retailers nationwide.
<p> The wallet pack is very convenient for storing in my purse and having it handy whenever I need a tissue, or if someone else needs one. The pack fits perfectly in a compartment in my purse and I always know where it is. It's very compact and doesn't take up a lot of room at all. I love the pattern on it too, it's very bright and colorful. I think the catchy packaging designs will attract tweens and children to want to to use tissues more.
<p> I don't have a car, so I gave the auto pack to my parents. They were really appreciative of it and immediately put it in the car door for easy access. It fits in the car door with ease and the top of the boxes faces up so you can grab a tissue whenever needed. It can be annoying when you're driving and you need a tissue and you can't reach the box from the backseat. You'll never have that problem again since the pack will be right within your reach.
<p> I love the colorful pattern on the packaging of the pocket pack. It's eye-catching and fun. This product is great for running a few quick errands when you don't want to lug a big purse around with you. If you're feeling under the weather, just put the pocket pack into your pants pocket and you're good to go with Kleenex protection. The pack fits perfectly in your jeans pocket and is there for easy access when needed. The packs would be great for kids to take to school with them or on-the-go for after school activities.
<p> I wanted to let you know about a fabulous new Kleenex product that was just released last month. It's available in major nationwide retailers.
<p> Kleenex brand – the brand that invented the facial tissue category – continues its tradition of leadership, innovation and softness with its 2011 launch of Kleenex Cool Touch™ Facial Tissues.
<p> New Kleenex Cool Touch tissues are the only tissues that release a cool sensation to soothe a sore nose on contact while providing all the softness you expect from Kleenex brand.
<p> The unscented tissues are enriched with cooling moisturizers and aloe and release a cool sensation on contact to provide soothing comfort. Body heat activates the special ingredient in the tissue which creates the cooling sensation.
<p> Every year, the U.S. alone reports more than 62 million cases of the common cold and 24 million sore noses. When people are sick the combination of nasal excretions and extensive wiping create a sore red nose that feels hot and uncomfortable. Kleenex Cool Touch Facial Tissue was designed to soothe this discomfort by reducing the temperature of the skin on the nose and providing much needed relief.
<p> This product sounds wonderful and I will definitely be trying it this winter when I'm bound to get sick.
<p> *Disclosure* Thank you to Kleenex and Kimberly Clark for supplying me with products to faciliate this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I love to spoil my Colby. I'm constantly buying her toys and treats. If she could talk she would be very excited to tell me that she loves her new squeaky duck, but a tail wag is sufficient enough. :) Colby has two beds (one upstairs and one downstairs) with blankets in each so she is always in ultimate comfort. I've been searching for a cute new blanket for her for awhile now. I have't been able to find one that is her style until stumbling upon Minky Couture.
<p> Minky Couture offers top quality blankets for babies, children and adults. The blankets come in a variety of styles, sizes, colors and patterns for anyone's taste and liking. Minky Couture blankets make a perfect gift for a new baby as they can be personalized and made to your specifications. Blankets are a great gift for practically anyone too. Who doesn't love a comforting blanket? How about sending your child off to college with a fuzzy, warm blanket? The blankets are thick and durable and are perfect for cuddling on the couch with a good book, or even keeping warm on those chilly nights. If you have a Minky Couture blanket, you'll definitely be in high blanket couture. :)
<p> I received the pet blanket for Colby to review. The blanket features a pink polka dot front and pink back with white trim. It's adorable and perfect for her since she's such a girly dog.
<p> The blanket is very soft and as you can see Colby already loves laying on it. She took to it immediately and this might just be her new favorite blanket! It fits her girly personality to a T. The pink is a great soft color. The polkadots are a vibrant white and the white trim adds a fun aspect to the blanket. It's the pefect size for her as she is a small dog, but if it were any smaller it wouldn't cover her. It's machine washable and I can throw it in the washing machine if it gets dirty. She loves when she's laying in her bed and you cover her with a blanket so she can snuggle up to it. I can see Colby enjoying this blanket for a while to come. :)
