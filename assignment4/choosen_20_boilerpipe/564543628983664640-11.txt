<p> Pasta is a huge favorite food of mine. I love that there's so many ways to prepare it and of course you can't forget how great it tastes! I would say tortellini and spaghetti are my absolute two favorites. Add a little basil, a hearty marinara sauce, and some parmesean cheese and you've got me drooling. :)
<p> For four generations, Barilla has been bringing the flavors of Italy to your table and the spirit of Italy to your life. Barilla believes sharing a meal can help build closer relationships with family and friends. We want you to embrace the good life by discovering the lifestyle, culture and rich heritage of Italy.
<p> Barilla offers so many different types of pasta that there's always new ways to jazz it up. How about ziti with shrimp and sausage with a vodka or marinara sauce? Or maybe penne with diced chicken in an alfredo sauce? They both sound awesome!
<p> The pasta that Barilla sells would be perfect for creating a refreshing summer pasta salad. How about a base of cheese tortellini with a little bit of cheese, peppers, and some cucumber? Be creative and add your favorite ingredients for a delectable lunch.
<p> One winner will win two bags (one large and one small) of Barilla tortellini. The flavors will be three cheese and spinach and cheese.

<p> I go to the beach a lot in the summer, so it's imperative that I have a few swimsuits on hand at all times. I love really pretty swimsuits with lots of personality and color. Aerin Rose offers me just that in such a stylish way!
<p> Aerin Rose sells fashionable swimsuits in a variety of styles and colors. Whether you're looking for tankini's, one piece's, or bikini's, they have you covered. They also have a full figured collection. The swimsuits provide great support as well.
<p> I was sent a banded halter tankini called "Peacock" for review.
<p> Our most popular tankini style! This sought-after style, which features halter neck and back ties and hidden underwire for subtle support, now comes with removable padded inserts.Coordinates perfectly with our solid bottoms. Choose the Highwaist bottom for full-coverage or a Scoop style for a more revealing look.
<p> From the second I saw this swimsuit, I had to have it. It's so gorgeous! It instantly stood out to me when I was picking out a suit to review. I don't currently have any swimsuit like this one. When I received it in the mail, I couldn't wait to try it on to see how it looked. I've ordered swimsuits from catalogs before and I hate the way they look on, so I was happy and relived to see this swimsuit fit me with no problems at all. The suit was easy to take off and put on too. I've had swimsuits before that were very tight in the chest area, but this one was fine. I love the beautiful peacock-esque colors and the pattern is so fun! I have already washed the swimsuit once after wearing it and there was no issues with washing or drying it. Everything remained intact. I can't wait to wear this swimsuit to the beach in the final summer months. :)
<p> There's nothing more refreshing on a hot summer day then a delicious ice cream cone. How about a creamy vanilla with sweet chocolate chips on top? I can just taste it now!
<p> There's joy in every scoopful of Lovin' Scoopful Gourmet Light Ice Cream – 13 rich and creamy flavors with 1/2 the fat and fewer calories than premium ice cream. Plus 25% of profits are shared with Special Olympics and other causes. So go ahead – get a little Lovin', give a little lovin'.

<p> I'm always looking for new products and hair tools to make my hair healthy, shinier, and have more volume. I've used many products in the past that have failed me. I don't want to spend a large chunk of money on something that won't show me the results that I want. That's why I turned to Conair, because I always receive the desired results with their products.
<p> Conair is a developer, manufacturer and marketer of health and beauty products and kitchen and electronic appliances. Since its founding in 1959,the company has become a leading manufacturer of nationally branded personal and health care small appliances. Conair holds the number one position in the industry with hair dryers and curling irons. Other products also include grooming, health and wellness appliances.
<p> I've been using Conair hair dryers for years and I rely on them for durability, reliability, and quality products.
<p> I was sent a new product from Conair to review, an Infini Pro Conair Spin Air Brush. I had not heard of this product before receiving it, but knew it looked great for helping my hair achieve the volume and sleekness that I was looking for.
<p> Conair BC178 InfinitiPro Spin Air Rotating Styler An all-in-one tool that produces versatile hairstyles Conair is revolutionizing the way you dry and style your hair with the BC178 Spin Air Rotating Styler. It gives volume and shine to your hair while it simultaneously dries each strand. Drying is safe and delicate while delivering high heat. Don’t worry about damaging hot spots or frizzy strands with the BC178 Spin Air Rotating Styler. It’s convenient and easy to use and eliminates the need for a brush.
<p> Ion Technology gives you healthy, silky results Designed with ion technology, the BC178 allows you to achieve smooth, frizz-free hair without damage. True ionic generator releases up to 100x more concentrated ions than ions created from natural sources to protect hair from damage and seal in moisture for silky, smooth results and gorgeous shine.
<p> Create volume that fits your style To customize your volume, use with or without the spin function. This gives you ultimate freedom to volumize just as you like it and shine as you dry.
<p> Use with or without spin function This spinning brush opens the possibility for numerous styles and techniques. It adds volume while drying your hair and can give a distinct style other brushes cannot. You can also use it without the spin function for additional styles. And use the multi-directional rotation for carrying techniques and styles. The tangle-free anti-static bristles work through your hair to produces volumized results.
<p> I used this styling tool for the first time tonight after taking a shower. I'm sure you could use it on dry hair too without the spin feature for a quick styling, but it's more effective on wet hair.
<p> It took me a few minutes to learn how to properly use the styling tool, but eventually I figured it out. I like that it has a protective cover on it to protect the bristles. The settings are high, low, cool, and of course off. A really convenient feature of the spin air brush is the fact that it is tangle free and the bristles are anti-static. My hair is a magnet for static so I was happy to know that added static would not be added to my hair. It also features even ceramic heat for less damage. I sectioned off my hair and wrapped it around the end of the end of the tool. I pushed the spin button and my hair was quickly rolled up and wrapped around the brush and pulled upwards to the top of my head. I rolled the brush down slightly and pushed the spin button to make the brush go in the reverse direction to spin my hair downwards. My hair came out very smooth and had noticable volume. I was surprised at how quickly the section of my hair dried from only the first time of using it also.
<p> I finished off my hair and I was very pleased and impressed with the results. My hair was sleek, shiny, and very volumized. I also noticed that my hair was very smooth and had very little static, I loved it! It looked like I spent several hours in a fancy hair salon and spent a large chunk of change, but I didn't! I love that I can achieve salon results in my own home, it's awesome. If you're looking for a great styling tool that can make your hair look beautiful and give it a great style, look no further than the spin air brush. You will not regret it!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES: 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Brush.

<p> I recently did a review/giveaway for Jellypop shoes. Before my initial review, I was not aware of the company. I was so impressed with the great quality and style of the shoes, I knew I had to do another review! I still wear the pair I reviewed frequently and I love them. :)
<p> Jellypop shoes feature wedges, gladiator sandals, casual, dress shoes, and more. Jellypop presents a line of fresh footwear designs, laced with flirty details and a unique style. You should make Jellypop your go to shoe stop for any cute spring and summer shoe needs. The styles are so fun, I can guarantee you'll fall in love with a pair or two, or even three!
<p> I love looking at Jellypop's shoe collection on their website, the shoes are so adorable and fun!
<p> I received a pair of black flats called "Perfect Black Lace."
<p> These flats are really nice. I wear flats frequently so it's always nice to have another pair. I love that they are black since they black goes with so much. The shoe is crafted well, I can tell. The bottom of the shoe has great anti-slip grips to protect you and give you some support while walking. There's a cute large-sized thick bow on the top of the shoe which is a fun detail. Behind the bow is a lace ruffle that gives the shoe some added personality. Surrounding the outside of the shoe is a very intricate lace design. You can't really notice the lace pattern well unless you look at it up close. The pattern is fun and different, nothing that I've seen on a shoe before. The back of the shoe has a black panel on it.
<p> The shoes fit me well and are comfortable to walk around in. I am saving these for the end of summer/early fall so I have a new pair of flats for the fall season!

<p> Sweets and desserts are something that I absolutely love! I eat chocolate a few times a week, I just can't get enough of it. I'm trying to eat less of it though. I'm the kind of girl who loves "busy" chocolate, which is why FunkyChunky is right up my alley.
<p> If you have never tried Funky Chunky gourmet snacks, just one bite of our sinful confections will have you melting in delight. What makes them so deliciously tempting? We hand-drizzle popcorn, pretzel twists and other premium ingredients with a signature combination of white, milk and dark chocolates, then break them into mouth-watering chunks. At FunkyChunky products are hand-crafted with no trans-fats. MMM, doesn't that sound amazing? I love that the snacks have so much packed into one bite.
<p> I was in chocolate heaven when I received this package. So far I have only tried the Chip-Zel-Pop. I've been wanting to try chocolate covered potato chips for a while so I was excited to be able to try this. The Chip-Zel-Chip has potato chips, pretzels, popcorn, caramel and chocolate in it. Looking at the snack truly was a work of art. The caramel popcorn was large and fluffy. It was chock full of rich, sweet caramel flavor. I loved the chocolate covered chips and pretzels in the mix. The combination of sweet and salty is fabulous and decadently rich. The pretzels and chips provided a fantastic crunch and were drizzled with chewy caramel that was heavenly. The snack was topped with layers of three chocolates: dark, milk &amp; white. The many different layers of lusciously sweet chocolate were fantastically amazing. This snack truly is a chocolate lover's dream and I loved every second of eating it!

<p> I regularly eat sandwiches for lunch. They are easy, quick, and delicious. There's so many different varieties that you can make that the idea of a sandwich never gets tiring. Land O'Frost has made your life easier by bringing the sandwich to you all in one setting!
<p> Land O'Frost is the largest privately held sliced lunchmeat brand in the country. The company was started by a Dutch immigrant in the 50's. Land O'Frost offers any lunchmeat that you could want for a sandwich.
<p> A new thing that Land O'Frost is offering is lunch kits. The kit contains a wrap, a select type of meat, and a select type of cheese. Everything comes in one kit, you just have to add condiments and whatever else you'd like on the sandwich.
<p> I was sent oven roasted turkey and pepperjack cheese and black forest ham and swiss. Each kit contains 25 slices of Land O’Frost lunchmeat, five slices of cheese and five tortillas to make 5 sandwiches. The food items are specially separated in each kit for easy use. I like that each kit zips closed for guaranteed freshness after use.
<p> The biggest thing that I like about this kit is that it offers the wrap to you without any hesitation. You don't have to think what cheese would go great with this meat, or what kind of bread do I want to use for the sandwich, etc. Everything is made for you already.
<p> I do not eat ham, so I will not be using the ham kit at all. I did use the cheese from it though. I made my first wrap the other day. I was curious at how everything would taste since it was not all bought together. The wrap was nice, it was not overly thin but had just the right amount of thickness to it. I added a few slices of turkey to it, and one slice of cheese. The turkey had a nice oven roasted flavor to it and the pepperjack cheese was great too. The cheese had a perfect kick to it to give the wrap some pizazz. Turkey and cheese always goes well together and it's such a classic combination. I did substitute the pepperjack cheese for swiss the other day and that was also very good. I would possibly add bacon to the wrap for a nice added crunch too. These kits are great for preparing a quick wrap on the go to bring to lunch or school. You could also bring them on a car trip too if you're going hiking or camping.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TWO (2) winner for this contest. Two winners will win two wrap kits from Land O'Frost. They will receive one black forest ham and swiss, and one oven roasted turkey and pepperjack cheese.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Comfort foods provide you with a warm sense of life and happiness. Foods on this level are best shared with a group of friends over great conversation and lots of laughs. Alexia's products definitely fit this category well and they are quality products.
<p> Alexia offers all natural foods, trans fat free foods, organic foods, flavorful appetizers and premium artisan blends of items. Once you try Alexia, you will be hooked! The foods are rich and full of flavor and certainly not lacking on delicious taste.
<p> I've tried many of Alexia's products in the past and they are nothing short of awesome! The fries are crispy and crunchy, and the bread flavorful and delicious.
<p> Alexia has rolled out with a new product this time that I knew I had to try! What is it, you ask? Well sweet potato puffs! These are similiar to tater tots, but they are made with sweet potato instead of regular potatoes.
<p> I served these with a nice piece of fish and a salad the other night and the puffs went perfectly with both items! The puffs are really easy to cook. Just place them on a cookie sheet and pop them into the oven on 400F for 18-22 minutes. I know it might be hard to wait that long because the puffs are truly delicious, but you will have to. :) Once the puffs are done, they are ready to eat! The only mistake I made was that I didn't cook them long enough (I only cooked them for 20 minutes) so they weren't as crispy on the outside as they could have been. They were still good but now I know to cook them an extra minute longer for next time.
<p> The puffs are a perfect burnt orange color and they smelled awesome. I love Alexia's sweet potato fries so I knew that I would love these puffs. The puffs were crunchy (albeit not as crunchy as possible) on the outside and perfectly warm and fluffy on the inside. The sweet potato was very flavorful and great and they did not at all taste like they were frozen 20 minutes prior in my freezer! These puffs make a great side dish for chicken, steak, or any other poultry you'd like to serve it with. These are a healthy alternative to tater tots and kids will love these as will your whole family. What are you waiting for? Serve some sweet potato puffs today!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a bag of Alexia sweet potato puffs.

<p> Jewelry is something that I never leave home without. Everyday I wear earrings, rings, and sometimes a necklace or bracelet. I'm always on the lookout for new jewelry when I go shopping because I love to accessorize. I love big chunky, dangly jewelry too, that's my favorite style of jewelry.
<p> ChunkyBling makes beaded watch bands, bracelets, rings and necklace charm clusters. All of their jewelry is hand crafted and made to order. Looking for that special gift for a friend? How about a custom watch that you can build yourself? You can also customize your own necklace with chains and charms that you create! The jewelry at ChunkyBling is gorgeous and the best part is nobody else will have the same ring or necklace as you!
<p> I was sent a Swarovski pearl mystic black ring.
<p> Information about the ring: We're thrilled to introduce our new line of Swarovski crystal rings! These hand-crafted rings are made of silver plated beads, rhinestones and genuine Swarovski crystals. They are strung on durable stretch cord, so the sizing is flexible, and the rings are comfortable.
<p> This ring is very pretty! You have to be careful when you wear it though because it's on a stretch cord. I love that this is hand crafted rather than bought in a store, it's more unique that way. I really like the combination of the black, silver, and rhinestones together, it's a great mix. Each ring is available in two sizes. I picked a size 5-6 but since it's stretchy, it could easily fit someone who is a bigger 5 or 6 than me. I like that the ring isn't a strict size but would fit anyone in that size range. The rhinestones are very pretty and they actually sparkle in the light. The ring fits me very well and is very light! It's so comfortable that I barely notice I'm wearing it at all. The black stones are shiny and reflect nicely in the light too. I am really happy with this ring. It's great for night or day wear and will blend in great with whatever you're wearing!
<p> I'm an avid picture-taker. I see the beauty in so many things and I love to always have my camera with me to capture those images. Any party, trip, or fun time I'm going to, you can bet that I'll always have my camera with me.
<p> Fujifilm was established in 1934 with the aim of producing photographic films. Over the decades they have diversified into new markets and built a strong presence around the globe. Fujifilm's motto is simple: They are working in many areas from digital cameras to motion picture film, and computer media to medical imaging — to bring you better products, solve difficult problems and protect our planet's environment.
<p> I have been using Fujifilm products for years. I used to use their film cameras many years ago. When film cameras made the switch into digital cameras, you can guarantee that I purchased a Fujifilm digital camera. I trust their brand for reliability, dependability, and quality products.
<p> Fujufilm recently announced its new 2011 line of digital camera accessory cases, which range in colors and styles, and include quilted fashion cases, bowler-style bags and two rugged traditional bags for FinePix digital cameras. I loved the styles and colors and knew I had to get my hands on one for my camera! I have been using a hot pink case for my camera for a year or so, but I was growing tired of it and wanted to spice up the case!
<p> I was sent a Fujifilm Paisley case for review.
<p> I absolutely love this case! It's adorable and the print is so fun and colorful. Paisley is awesome because no print of it is alike, each design is always so different and original. I was worried when I first received the case that my camera wouldn't fit inside because the case is very small. It was not a problem though and my camera fits perfectly! The inside pattern is a pretty pattern of orange, green, yellow, white, and pink stripes. It reminds me of summer. The case comes with a wrist strap which is handy to use it you're on vacation and you want to keep your camera close to you, especially if you're taking a lot of pictures. The case zips closed and there is a handy pocket on the outside. The pocket would be great for putting some cash in, or even an extra memory chip if you're planning on taking a lot of pictures where ever you go. Thanks to Fujifilm my camera will have an awesome new case!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a paisley camera case from Fujifilm.

<p> Brownies are one of the best desserts ever. Forget ice cream, cookies, or even cake. While all of those are great, nothing beats a warm, delicious, fudgy brownie. YUM! Sometimes you need to take a second out of life and enjoy something sweet and tasty.
<p> Laura's Brownies are baked by Laura herself using her secret recipe. Laura’s Brownies can be delivered anywhere. The brownies are packaged in gift boxes and tins for all occasions—from a single brownie to a five-pound box of joy. They make great party treats and perfect holiday gifts!
<p> Are you looking for a gift for a family member or friend, but don't know what to get? Look no further than Laura's Brownies! They offer fantastic marshmallow brownies, caramel brownies, chocolate chippers, biscotti, lemon bars, gluten free brownies, and so much more! Anyone who has a sweet tooth will love a fantastic treat from Laura's!
<p> I was sent a tin filled with fantastic marshmallow and caramel brownie bites. I was expecting full sized brownies, but the small pieces are even better!
<p> Don't these look simply heavenly? I think perhaps these brownies are the gateway to heaven!
<p> I liked that the tin I received was filled with small brownie bites, it made me feel less guilty for indulging rather than knowing I was eating a whole brownie at once.
<p> I couldn't wait to get my hot little hands on the caramel brownie first. I popped in a brownie bite into the microwave on high for about 10 seconds. When I opened the microwave door I could smell the sweet caramel and luscious chocolate. It smelled like I had been baking, but the microwave did all of the work! I poured myself a cold glass of milk and settled in to give my taste buds something to thank me for. The brownie was dense and packed full of wonderful chocolate and caramel. I took a bite and it was pure bliss. I swear the whole world stopped when I consumed that first bite. It was like no brownie I ever had before. The chocolate was rich and delicious and the caramel wonderfully flavorful and sweet. Chocolate and caramel together are such a timeless, classic combination. You cannot go wrong when pairing the two. The brownie was warm, and the caramel was gooey and it was just melt in your mouth fantastic. Laura really knows how to make a brownie! These brownies would also be just as wonderful cold in an ice cream sundae too!
<p> The next day I tried the marshmallow brownie. I am a huge lover of marshmallows so I knew that this brownie would be right up my alley. I much prefer brownies warmed up then "cold", so I zapped it in the microwave for a few seconds. I anxiously counted down the seconds until my marshmallow and chocolate treat was done. The microwave beeped and I couldn't get to the microwave fast enough! The brownie was perfectly warm and the marshmallow was slightly melted, the perfect combination. The brownie itself was dense and had a marshmallow topping with a chocolate drizzle on top. The brownie was almost too pretty to eat, but hey who am I kidding? I would never turn down a brownie! I took a bite and prepared myself to enter the world of chocolate bliss. The brownie was sweet, dense, and full of fantastic chocolate flavor. The marshmallow topping was quite unique. I don't think I've ever had marshmallow inside or on top of a brownie before. It gave the brownie a sweet and fluffy edge, which I really enjoyed. The brownie was simply divine to say the least. I could have easily had 2 or 3 more but I had to control myself!
<p> I highly recommend you try Laura's Brownies if you haven't already, they will change the way you eat brownies forever!
