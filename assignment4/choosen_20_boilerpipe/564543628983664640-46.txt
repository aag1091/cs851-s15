<p> I absolutely love curling my hair. I tend to curl it for special events, parties, and just if I feel like having curly hair that day. It's important to take preventative measures of damaging your hair from the curling iron, and using a heat protecting spray when curling your hair. I've been curling my hair for years and I love that with one roll of my hair in the iron, I achieve beautiful curls.
<p> John Frieda is an English celebrity hairstylist and founder of hair salons and hair products. This brand is your go-to choice for keeping your hair looking fabulous and beautiful. The brand offers shampoo and conditioners, volumizing products, serums, and of course curling irons and flat irons. I've been using John Freida shampoo and conditioners for years and have always loved the results.
<p> I've been needing a new curling iron for a while. The one I have now is very old and is not working up to its potential. When I had the chance to review a John Freida curling iron, I was very excited at the prospect.
<p> Curling iron heating up:It's a very sleek curling iron and I love the modern silver color of it. The temperature gauge is digital and you can increase or decrease the temperature by using the appropriate buttons.
<p> The curling iron was easy to use. In literally one second it was already heating up. My old one took a few seconds to gradually warm up. The buttons on the temperature gauge were easy to press. I started off with about 250 degrees. I know that may seem hot but the curling iron was only moderately warm! I easily wrapped my hair around the thick barrel and let the styling tool do its job. After doing a few curls, I realized that my hair wasn't curling like it normally does. I increased the temperature and figured that's what was wrong.
<p> This is what my hair looked like after increasing the temp. You can see curls, but they are not very bouncy and tight. These curls are loose and soft, not what I'm used to when I curl my hair. I'm not sure if I need to find the right temperature balance or what. This curling iron just might not do tight curls like I'm used to. I will have to try it again.
<p> I did like that my hair did not get stuck in the barrel and was easy to unroll too. The ceramic design of the curling iron helps to protect against frizz which is something I can always use.

<p> My eyebrows always need as much help as they can get. When I found out that Duane Reade was offering their eyebrow services complimentary only on June 15, I jumped at the chance. I needed my eyebrows shaped and plucked and whipped back into shape.
<p> I made an appointment for 6 pm, right after I got out of work. I used to live right near the Duane Reade on 53rd and 3rd that I went to, a few years ago. I didn't realize that they had remodeled the store. The store now had much more inventory and contained a Look Boutique, among many other new features.
<p> The girl who did my eyebrows was very sweet. Unfortunately, I cannot remember her name! She was very friendly and wanted me to feel as comfortable as you can when someone comes at your face with tweezers. She gave me the mirror many times throughout the session to make sure I was okay with how my brows were turning out. She gave me some helpful eyebrow care tips. I regularly get my eyebrows waxed and she told me this was really bad because the constant pulling at your skin can make it sag as you get older. I never thought about this before, but it does make sense.
<p> She spent time and did a thorough job on each eyebrow.
<p> Here's the after picture. The before picture is not allowed to be posted! Haha.As you can see my eyebrows are much thinner and fantastic! I'm very pleased with the results.
<p> I highly recommend the Look Boutique at Duane Reade on 53rd and 3rd for any of your eyebrow needs.

<p> Have you ever seen a pair of shoes that you loved, but wished they featured something that wasn't there? For example, a pair of black heels that would look amazing with a big red bow on them, or spikes on the back of a pair of red flats? You get the picture. Inga Liberte felt the same way as you. Now your shoe dreams can become a reality!
<p> Inga Liberte is a new fashion brand shoe bow collection line. The idea for the creation of a shoe bow line was born on January, 2012, when the founder, Inga Liberte, was shopping in her favorite boutique in Beverly Hills. She noticed two pairs of shoes of the same color, one came together with removable bows, and the other did not. She chose the pair without the bows, but as soon as she got home, started searching the internet for similar bows. But to no avail. And that is when the idea was born – Inga Liberte decided that she can make her own bows for her shoes!
<p> The best part about the bows is that they are removable. Put the bows on your favorite flats one day, and then your new pair of pumps the next! Be creative and have fun with it.

<p> Duane Reade recently created a buzz for this product and I was curious to try it out. My local DR did not carry any of the products, and I had to visit another neighborhood store which did carry them.
<p> My local Duane Reade.
<p> I don't normally make a list when I do my Duane Reade shops. If I have a really big shopping trip at Duane Reade, I will make a list. I usually just keep a mental list in my head of what I need. I usually make a weekly shopping trip to DR. This time I needed eye makeup remover, conditioner, white cheddar cheese popcorn and a few other things. The staff in my local Duane Reade is always extremely helpful and ready to answer any questions that you have. The customer service at this location is always the best! The staff is quick and very efficient.
<p> The only signage in my store is the signage advertising the items that are on sale in the circular and featured in the Duane Reader. The sale tags are yellow, easy to read and in bold, bright lettering. The Duane Reader and other DR themed information was on the store's window.
<p> When I went to purchase my eye make up remover, this was what I saw along the way:
<p> My beauty choices were L'Oreal, Maybelline, Neutrogena, etc. I always tend to stick with Wet and Wild's eye make up remover because I've been using it for years and achieve great results with it.
<p> The shelves are well stocked with cosmetic products and everything is neatly organized. It's easy to find what I'm searching for, and get on with my shopping trip.
<p> Next, I made my way to the hair care products aisle to find my anti-frizz product. Garnier is a brand I always trust for my hair. I was recommended this from a friend. I was envious of how great her hair looked when blow-dried daily. She says this keeps it shiny, healthy, and less frizzy.
<p> I purchased a few more items along the way.
<p> I then went to the next Duane Reade to purchase the Clear Hair and Scalp Shampoo.
<p> The entrance to the second level where all of the merchandise is.
<p> Then I made my way to the next Duane Reade to buy the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy shampoo. I did not realize that they made the products for men too. There was a little video box advertising the products and what you could get out of them. I purchased the strong lengths nourishing shampoo. It was a toss-up between that and the root-boosting volume shampoo. I flat iron and blow dry my hair daily and my scalp could use all of the nourishing it can get! Before participating in this shopperunity, I was not aware of the products. I can't wait to try them now!
<p> This video box gave out information about the product and was a very handy advertising tool. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this at DR before.

<p> Perfume is something that I wear everyday without fail, and it's important to me to wear. I love stopping by Sephora to smell all of the wonderful scents and find new favorites. The scents that I like most are light and subtle with sweet notes. My favorite perfume, Ralph Lauren's hot was recently discontinued. It was time to find a new perfume love!
<p> Laura Mercier is a world-renowned makeup artist and creator of Laura Mercier cosmetics, skincare, body &amp; bath, and fragrance. The Laura Mercier philosophy revolves around the flawless face - the concept that making skin look perfect is the first and foremost important thing a woman can do to achieve a great look. Laura believes that a flawless look begins with a fresh canvas, and each product has been specially developed to allow every woman to achieve an incredibly even, smooth, natural-looking complexion.
<p> Everything Laura Mercier creates turns to gold. When I found out she had recently created an almond coconut product line and there was a perfume in the line, I knew I had to try it. I've been more than satisfied with her makeup which I've previously reviewed.
<p> When creating this scent, Laura wanted to recreate a tropical island ambiance by mixing almond with the coconut’s milk and pulp to create a suave scent that is sensuous and sweet but not too sugary.
<p> I was sent a bottle of Laura Mercier Almond Coconut Eau de Toilette.Inspired by the Laura Mercier Body and Bath Gourmande Collection, this scent captures the essence of almond, coconut milk, jasmine, rosewood, ylang-ylang, vanilla, tonka, heliotrope and musk.
<p> This perfume came into my life at just the right time. I recently had ran out of perfume and was wondering what I should buy next. There are so many perfume options that it can be sometimes overwhelming to choose. I decided to try this one.
<p> The perfume bottle is very clean and simple, no bright lettering or bold colors. The scent is very light and airy and reminds me of being on vacation in Hawaii. All I need is a frozen margarita now! You can equally distinguish between the almond and coconut notes, but each scent compliments each other excellently. I would say the perfume is a perfect feminine, summer choice. It's not heavy at all and is perfect to wear year round.
<p> The perfume is easy to spray on and does not stick to your skin, but easily absorbs in.
<p> I'm really happy with the way the scent of the perfume and I look forward to wearing it everyday.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* I received this complimentary perfume in exchange for the review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Now that summer's on the horizon, you know what that means! It's grillin' time of course! Open the pool, fire up the grill, and invite your friends and family over for a tasty BBQ. Burgers and hotdogs are summer staple items that everyone enjoys. It's important that you have a lot of hamburger and hotdog buns ready to feed your hungry guests with. Kinnikinnick will keep you prepared!
<p> Kinnikinnick Foods is the pioneer in gluten free breads. They produce hamburger and hotdog buns, soft white bread and multigrain bread. All of their bread products contain NO gluten, dairy or nuts. The breads are made with NO artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors; are fortified with five essential nutrients, and contain at least five grams of fiber per serving and zero cholesterol. You may be thinking that since the bread is gluten free that it's also taste-free, that's not the case at all. If you're looking for a healthier bread option, I highly recommend this company.
<p> I received a wonderful package containing all sorts of delicious bread. My package featured hotdog rolls, hamburger rolls, white bread, and multi-grain bread. I was definitely in bread heaven! I regularly eat multigrain bread, so I was happy to see that Kinnikinick produces a favorite of mine. All of the bread looked wonderful and of high quality. I couldn't wait to try some!
<p> Can't you just imagine making a delicious sandwich for lunch with the multi-grain bread? I know I can!
<p> High quality white bread is a favorite of many.
<p> Make sure to put extra mustard or ketchup on that grilled hot dog.
<p> The bread didn't look much different from any regular bread I've had before. It was a little darker in color, that was the only real difference I noticed. I have not previously tried gluten free bread, so I was intrigued at the thought of doing so.
<p> I decided my gluten free bread sampling must procede with the multigrain bread first. The slices were thick and the color was a warm brown. The crust and tops of the bread were speckled with lots of grainy goodness that I loved. I made myself a turkey sandwich for lunch and then decided it was time to dig in. The bread was soft, but firm at the same time. Upon first bite, I can best describe the taste as rustic and earthy, but enjoyable. The bread had a pleasant chewiness to it and each bite was more delicious than the last! I liked the flavor of the bread and it went down smoothly and easily. It wasn't overly dry or rough. The bread was unlike any multigrain bread that I've had before. I didn't notice a huge taste difference from gluten free bread vs. normal bread. There was a slight difference though. I really liked the fact that it's fortified with nutrients and is good for you. Anything that tastes great and is healthy for you is a favorite in my book.
<p> I haven't had a chance to try the other breads yet. The others are in my freezer. I'm having a BBQ in a few weeks and plan to make hamburgers and hotdogs. You can bet that I'll be bringing Kinnikinnick to the party! :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a bread prize pack from Kinnikinnick Foods featuring hamburger buns, hot dog buns, soft white bread, and multigrain bread.
<p> Winner will be chosen on June 19th, 2012 at 10 pm and then will be emailed. One entry per day.Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours. Thank you and good luck!
