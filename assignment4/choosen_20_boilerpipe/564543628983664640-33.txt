<p> Like I've mentioned before, I hate winter. I'm not a fan of cold weather, and I certainly don't like not being able to stay outside for long periods of time. What I do like about winter is the fashion though. The gorgeous coats, the pretty scarves, the beautiful boots, and warm gloves. I love all winter fashion. Too bad I can't get used to the weather though, huh?
<p> Payless is the largest specialty family footwear retailer in the western hemisphere. The company was founded in 1956 in Topeka, Kansas on a revolutionary idea - selling shoes in a self-select environment. More than 50 years later, Payless serves millions of customers through its powerful network of more than 4,500 stores, in a variety of retail settings. If you're looking for men, women, or children's shoes, Payless is your shoe headquarters! They offer a variety of style ranges for whatever your shoe need may be.
<p> I tried endlessly last night and this morning to upload a video review of the boots, it just wouldn't work. I really would have rather shared the video then a text review. I am working to try to fix the upload problem.
<p> I was sent an adorable pair of Payless boots called "Molly."
<p> I've been looking for a a cute and comfy pair of boots for a while now. New York City winters are tough and these are just the boots to brave the cold weather in. I definitely these these are it! The brown is a great neutral color for winter. I love that it goes with so much. The fake fur at the top is warm and also very soft too. The boots themselves fit me well and are very comfortable. A pair of skinny jeans would look great tucked into them when paired with a warm sweater. The boots themselves are constructed well. The soles look supportive and sturdy. I like the buckles that are on the side of the boots too. The stitching on the bottom near the sole is a nice touch too. I am looking forward to wearing these boots this winter. Thank you Payless!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Payless for providing me with a complimentary pair of boots in exchange for this review. All thoughs and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I'm one of the rare people who actually enjoys doing laundry. There's something soothing and relaxing about knowing that your clothes are getting washed and dried while you sit back and wait. If you have a product to make your clothes smell fantastic, that makes doing laundry even better!
<p> Purex and Jockey have teamed up and are offering you a 20% off coupon. We all know Purex from the fantastic laundry products that they offer, and of course Jockey makes work-out clothes and men and women's clothes available to you. The two brands that you love are offering you fantastic savings, you can't get much better than that!
<p> I was sent a great prize pack featuring a Jockey sports bra and a bottle of Purex crystals in the Tropical Splash scent. It's always great to have a sports bra to work out in, especially if you go running or walk on the treadmill. The sports bra is comfortable, supportive, and fits me well.
<p> There are some great features of the sports bra:■Moisture-wicking helps keep you cool and dry■Key pocket which is very convenient for working out anywhere■Reflective logo which is great for safety■Breathable mesh panels■Soft bottom band for comfortable support
<p> The Purex crystals are fantastic. I've reviewed them in the past and each scent is better than the last. Just pour a capful of the "magical" crystals into your load of laundry at the beginning of the cycle. When the cycle is complete, your laundry will smell Purex-irifc! One sniff of my clothes after they've been infused with the crystals and I'm whisked away to a tropical island! I've washed my sports bra quite a few times and it is still in perfect condition and looks brand new. The softener gets rid of any clothing odor without harming the clothes.
<p> You'll love that your laundry is fresh and clean with the power of Purex! I didn't realize that you shouldn't use fabric softeners, when you wash your gym clothes. I bet you didn't either. Regular liquid softener products use oils to soften clothing, and these oils can harm the moisture wicking ability of active wear This can be avoided when you use Purex. Just one more great reason to switch to this brand.

<p> Winter can definitely take a toll on skin. That cold winter air and winds don't do skin any favors. It's important to take care of yourself during the cold months of the year to avoid dry, rough, and cracked skin. Make your skin happy by keeping it moisturized and hydrated!
<p> Lac-Hydrin Five Moisturizing Lotion is a non-greasy, alpha-hydroxy-acid lotion formula that has been clinically proven to relieve the dryness and scaliness associated with dry skin. LAC-HYDRIN® FIVE’s gentle formulation is ideal for those who suffer from chronic dry skin such as atopic dermatitis and eczema. Its main ingredient, alpha hydroxy acid, restores moisture to the skin by repairing the skin’s natural barrier.
<p> My skin gets very dry in the winter and I constantly am applying creams and moisturizers to my feet and ankles to keep them soft and hydrated. Cracked skin is painful and something I definitely don't recommend.
<p> When I was contacted to review this product, I was very interested. The product says it is clinically proven to relieve dryness and scaliness that is associated with dry skin. What can be better than that?
<p> I received the product and I was actually happy to receive a sample size, instead of a full bottle. That way I can throw it in my purse and always have it. The bottle says that it softens even your driest skin which really peaked my interest. I have a rough patch of skin on my ankle, and decided now was a great time to put the product to the test.
<p> The product has virtually no smell at all. Be careful when you open the bottle as the lotion squeezed out a little bit on its own. You only need a small amount as a little goes a long way. The lotion very easily rubbed into my ankle and in no time was gone. I was left a very smooth and soft ankle! My dry patch was much more hydrated and less noticable. There wasn't any greasy residue left behind which I really liked too! I really like the results that this lotion gave me. I like that it has healing ingredients in it too, that's important to me. I will definitely be keeping it handy for dry elbows, ankles, and hands in the near future!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a LAC-Hydrin Five Moisturizing Lotion.

<p> It's always fun to challenge your palate and introduce yourself to new foods. Of course we all have our resident favorites, but why not spice it up a little? Dr. Praeger's is here to open up a whole new world of culinary delight to you! Go ahead and dive right in!
<p> It all started in 1994 when successful New Jersey cardiac surgeon Dr. Peter Praeger and his medical partner, Dr. Eric Somberg, helped keep a family business alive. They bought Ungar’s Gefilte Fish – a popular food company within the Jewish and Yiddish communities. The doctors set out on a simple mission – to help people see nutritious food in a new light. They expanded the company to include all-natural and sensible products that would appeal to a wider consumer base. They kept the Ungar’s brand, which includes the original gefilte fish and other traditional Jewish foods, and developed Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods, which now includes dozens of all-natural, kosher frozen foods.
<p> Dr. Praeger's philosophy is that good-for-you food should actually taste good, especially if you don’t let artificial ingredients, colors and fillers get in the way. That’s why our products are made with ingredients you recognize, including flash-frozen vegetables and fish from cold Northern waters. Our hearty California Veggie Burger doesn’t conceal its tasty spinach, broccoli, peas, carrots and onions –it puts them right where you can see and taste them! And our gluten-free options are an easy way to keep wheat out of your diet, while keeping the good things in, like fiber and taste bud-pleasing flavor.

<p> There's nothing quite like cake. The delectably moist and fluffy confectionary treat is something that I just can't get enough of, especially if it's fresh out of the oven. A slice of chocolate cake is one of my favorite desserts, although I don't discriminate against cake. Do you know what's even better than a piece of cake on a plate? Cake on a stick, of course!
<p> BakePops are the latest sensation and now you can make these delicious treats in your own home! It's so easy! Just fill the specially designed Bake Pop pan with ANY cake mix, put on the custom lid and pop it in the oven. Before you know it, you'll have 24 bite-sized cake pops ready to decorate and eat!
<p> I bet you can already picture making fantastic Bakepops with the cake mix of your choice, right? Of course you can't forget to decorate it your yummy treat on a stick. The possibilities are endless too, which is the fun part! How about a chocolate Bakepop with vanilla icing drizzled on it? Maybe a yellow cake Bakepop with peanut butter icing and rainbow sprinkles is more up your alley? Whatever you choose, I'm sure it will be very delicious.
<p> This would be a fun winter weekend afternoon project to do with your child. They will love being able to spend time with mom and have a treat too! It's also good for an adult too!
<p> Bakepops are wonderful for parties and social events. Impress your friends or family with a tray full of Bakepops at your next party. They will love it!

<p> Vacation and relaxation are two words that definitely go hand in hand. It's important to make some time for yourself on a regular basis and de-stress. When I booked my vacation to the Bahamas, I knew that I would love to incorporate a massage into my trip. I contacted the Royal Suite Day Spa in Nassau, Bahamas and the rest was history!
<p> The Royal Suite Day Spa is a lovely spa that is located inside of the Hilton hotel in Nassau. When you walk in, you're welcomed by a very friendly staff who is happy to provide you with any spa service of your choice. The spa offers a variety of massages, manicures, pedicures, facials, body scrubs, reflexology, body wraps, and much more. Special package deals are available too. Your stress will be instantly melted away when you leave the spa.
<p> My boyfriend and I were able to receive a couple's massage which was excellent! Who doesn't love to be pampered?
<p> The massage was fantastic and I felt comfortable and relaxed throughout the whole session. The lights were dimmed, soothing music was played, and soft candles were lit. I can't imagine anything more perfect, can you? There was even a small fruit plate for us too. I received a massage from Ketra, who is the spa manager. She performed her magic on me and worked out all the kinks and tension in my back. I loved every minute of it! The pressure she used was perfect, it wasn't too hard but just right. I instantly noticed the difference in how I felt after the massage versus when I came in to the spa. My stress level was down and I felt much more relaxed. I couldn't ask for a better experience. The only complaint I had was that the massage was over way too soon! :) Once you leave the spa, you're surrounded by the backyard of the Hilton hotel which offers lush plants, a pool, and a nice sitting area.
<p> My boyfriend also enjoyed his massage as well. He had some back pain and all of the pain was whisked away by magical fingers. He felt fantastic afterwards and loved the massage too. The staff was extremely professional and made sure your needs were taken care of.
<p> If you're ever in Nassau, I highly recommend visiting the Royal Suite Day Spa. You will not be disappointed.

<p> I'm a big fan of Victoria's Secret Pink collection. I have their sweatpants, underwear, bras, and hoodies. The clothing is made well and washes excellently. The patterns and designs on the items are always eye-catching and adorable. I'm always on the lookout for new Pink items to get my hands on!
<p> Victoria's Secret is inspired by a love for lingerie, and the desire to bring beauty—and fantasy—into every woman’s wardrobe. They believe little luxuries are of grand importance. And what’s closest to your body is always closest to their heart. Victoria's Secret sells a range of different items besides lingerie. They offer sleepwear, cosmetic &amp; skincare items, and more! The items are quality made and last.
<p> I was contacted by VS because they knew I liked the Pink line. Their newest products are NFL branded hoodies, underwear and sweats from all 32 teams. I was sent a Denver Broncos hipster panty gift set. The set contains 3 pairs of underwear branded with a Broncos graphic.
<p> I have many pairs of Victoria Secret's underwear and they are always comfortable and fit well. The underwear in this gift set was also very comfortable as well to wear. The underwear came packaged in a cute gift set that was tied with a bow. I liked the presentation of it. One pair is blue and has a sparkly orange graphic that says "touchdown" on the back, the other pair is white and has "I *DISCLOSURE* I received the product in exchange for this review.
