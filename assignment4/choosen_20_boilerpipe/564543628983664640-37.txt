<p> Shoes are my biggest weakness. I have far too many pairs, but it's hard to stop myself from purchasing new ones. If they are cute I will easily lay down my credit card! A few times a year I donate old pairs to make room for new ones. I couldn't imagine only wearing the same 3 or 4 pairs of shoes in a row. I need variety, and accessorizing is so much fun! I'm sure all of you ladies have the same mindset as I do.

<p> Wearing makeup is a part of my daily life. I couldn't imagine not including it in my beauty routine. I love to experiment with new colors and shades, not to mention it's a lot of fun. Who doesn't want to change up their look every so often? It's important to express yourself and makeup is the perfect medium for doing so.
<p> Laura Mercier is a world-renowned makeup artist and creator of Laura Mercier cosmetics, skincare, body &amp; bath, and fragrance. The Laura Mercier philosophy revolves around the flawless face - the concept that making skin look perfect is the first and foremost important thing a woman can do to achieve a great look. Laura believes that a flawless look begins with a fresh canvas, and each product has been specially developed to allow every woman to achieve an incredibly even, smooth, natural-looking complexion.
<p> Laura Mercier creates products to make your skin radiant and beautiful. Whether you're looking for foundation, blush, tinted moisturizer and more, they have you covered.
<p> My main concern is wanting my skin to look as best as possible. I'm always searching for that product to give me flawless skin. When I stumbled upon Laura Mercier's foundation primer, it sounded like just the thing that my skin needed.
<p> This lightweight, water-based primer creates a smooth, invisible layer that acts as a buffer between the skin and makeup. Specialized for oily, sensitive, and acne-prone skin types, its high water content soothes surface dehydration around active blemishes.
<p> The primer comes in a decent sized tube and there is a lot of product in it. I used it on clean, washed skin and then put my foundation on top of it. It easily comes out and looks like liquid foundation. The light-weight primer easily and smoothly rubs into my skin with no problem. It matched my skin tone perfectly too. I instantly noticed that my skin looked different and better once I applied it, even with no foundation on! Once I put my foundation on top of it I really noticed the difference. I really think it improved the quality of my skin. It made my makeup look flawless and last longer. I really liked the way it made me look. I didn't notice any irritants or issues developing on my face when I wear the primer. This is the perfect primer for guaranteeing a fabulous look for any face!

<p> Once I find a brand that I like, I am loyal to that brand for years. I like to find new brand favorites of course, but there are certain products that I only buy from the brand I am loyal to. I've been a long-time fan of Kraft cheeses and snack products for years. They are one of the only cheese brands I will buy. I trust Kraft for quality, taste, and price. Kraft has stood the test of time and has been popular for many, many years. There's a reason why.
<p> Kraft is a global snacks powerhouse with an unrivaled portfolio of brands people love. They market crackers, confectionery treats, beverages, cheeses, grocery products, and convenient meals in approxmiately 170 countries. Most people don't realize that Kraft makes more than just cheese and macaroni and cheese.
<p> When I heard that Kraft had recently introduced a line of milk and granola bars, I knew I wanted to try them. Kraft MilkBite milk and granola bars are made with real milk and calcium, making them an excellent source of calcium with 30% of the daily recommended value. They are a great source of vitamin D and fiber, include 5g of protein, 7g of whole grains, and no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. They do need to be kept refrigerated though. The bars come in five delicious flavors-chocolate, strawberry, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, and mixed berry. Each box contains five bars. A flavor everyone's taste buds!
<p> I was sent two boxes of Kraft bars to review, chocolate and strawberry. The bars came in a cute Kraft lunchbag too! I'm a big fan of most granola bars, so I had a good feeling that I would like these.
<p> I tried the chocolate one first, of course. :) The bar is a small rectangular sized treat. It has chocolate chips inside and on the top and was drizzled with beautiful chocolate on top. The bar was thicker and denser than most granola bars than I am used to, which I liked. The snack was chewy, fresh, and full of great granola and chocolate taste. The chocolate flavor was prevalent, but not overly sweet. I enjoyed that the bar was cold, it was refreshing. It would be the perfect cool treat on a hot summer's day too. The bar would also be a nice, healthy snack to throw in a lunchbox or for a mid-day pick-me-up. I like that it has whole grain and protein benefits. I'm all for anything that tastes great and has health benefits too.
<p> The strawberry was very enjoyable as well. The size of the bar was the same size as the chocolate one. The bar had white icing drizzled generously on the top. There were chunks of strawberries on top and inside. The strawberry chunks were large and full of flavor. The flavor of strawberry was noticeable and the treat was very fresh. Each bite was packed with an equal amount of strawberry chunks and granola. In my opinion this bar was a little sweeter than the chocolate, but not so overly sweet. This would be a great snack to keep in your fridge at work if you need a sweet treat during the day. It's also equally as perfect to throw in a child's lunchbox for school. Keep an icepack in there to keep it cold though.
<p> Each bar contains 140 calories which isn't terrible, but remember it's not an extremely low-calorie snack.
<p> I've enjoyed the bars that I've tried so far and I look forward to trying the other MilkBite flavors!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Kraft for providing me with the complimentary package to review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Have you ever been to an ice cream shop and none of the flavors really stood out to you. Sure you have the typical vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, etc, but you want something really unique and different. Let's say you want something like nutella marshmallow. It sounds delicious but most ice cream shops won't sell a flavor like that. With an ice cream maker all of your fantastic sweet treat ideas and dreams can now come true!
<p> White Mountain Products was founded in 1853. They've always been about making good times happen right at home; with ice cream you make yourself. The experience starts with the discussion—often the kids get their pick—of what flavor ice cream your family wants to make. Vanilla with bittersweet chocolate chips or maybe peach made with orchard fresh peaches. Every delicious choice is limited only by your imagination. Just set up your White Mountain® Electric Ice Cream Maker with ice and rock salt, and let the fun begin. Whether you're cooling off a hot summer picnic or warming up a homebound winter weekend, the experience is one you can't put a price on.
<p> Just imagine it now! Do you want banana with chocolate chips? Done! How about strawberry with blueberry chunks in it? You bet! Even green tea ice cream can be made. The possibilities are endless. The best part is that you'll be making it right at home!
<p> You'll be very popular when you serve ice cream made from your new ice cream maker at your next party, or even BBQ in the summer! It's also great family fun to make ice cream with your children. They'll love spending time with you and creating their own tasty treat.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 4 quart electric ice cream maker from White Mountain Products.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> This is post #4 for Kiddie Academy. I had never thought about opening a franchise, but this is something that is working well for people, especially Angie and Rafael!
<p> Angie and Rafael Monreal opened their Kiddie Academy, franchise, which is located at 18600 NW 87 Avenue, Miami, Florida, in September 2007, at ages 30 and 36.
<p> Although they are still relatively new to the area, the couple is showing parents that the innovative curriculum, hands-on approach, and commitment to each child, the hallmarks of the Kiddie Academy system, make their academy unlike any other child care provider in the area.
<p> Background: Angie and Rafael Monreal wanted to open their own business and spent a year researching various franchises and other types of businesses. They were still unsure what concept would be the best fit until fate intervened. While employed in the financial sector, Angie began searching for a child care center for her children to attend, but was dismayed by what she found. Not wanting to leave her children at an establishment not up to her standards, Angie used her business know-how and determination to open her own Kiddie Academy franchise, the first child care provider in the area that met her standards. Kiddie Academy appealed to the Monreals as business owners, as well as parents. Local residents see that enthusiasm from the moment they walk through the door of the Monreal's academy.
<p> Goals: The Monreals are currently working with their staff and clients to streamline their operation and discover how best to provide the families in the Miami area with the best child care possible. Once the Monreals get their first Miami academy established, they would like to further assist local parents by expanding into a second location. The Monreals also hope to begin contributing to a variety of charities in the area within the coming months.
<p> Challenges: As a new business in the area, the Monreals find the biggest challenge has been getting the word out to attract new families to their location. As more people see how good they are, their enrollment numbers continue to climb.
<p> Results: Since opening, the Monreals have seen a steady increase in enrollment based on referrals from currently enrolled families – a sure sign that their existing customers believe in the concept as much as the Monreals do. At the end of each day, when children are lined up outside her office door refusing to leave without a hug goodbye, Angie knows that becoming a Kiddie Academy franchisee was the right decision.
<p> *DISCLOSURE*I have a 3 month relationship with Kiddie Academy for which I am being compensated for. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine, and not based on anything else.
<p> I used to think that ice cream and gelato were only treats meant for the summer. Surely it's too cold to eat in the winter! Over the past few years I've discovered that there's no reason why you can't enjoy that creamy, sweet treat year round! Go ahead and indulge in that bowl of mint chocolate chip gelato when it's snowing outside. It'll taste just as great in the cold weather. You know you want to. :)

<p> A lot of movie watching happens in my house. I'm a big movie fan, so I'm constantly watching the latest flick. When you buy a lot of DVD's, you can only have so many before you start to run out of room in your TV or DVD shelf to store them. Wouldn't it be nice to watch whatever you wanted, any time of day or night, even if you don't own the movie? That's where the Roku steps in!
<p> The Roku is a digital media player which supports signals up to 1080p. It features a built-in wireless networking that allows you to stream media to your TV, so you can enjoy your favorite TV shows, movies and more in stunning high-definition.

<p> The Roku is a revolutionary device which will change your movie viewing forever!
<p> I was sent a Roku - 2 XD Wireless Digital Media Player.
<p> I had Netflix years ago, but keeping up with sending in the disks and waiting to receive your next one was a pain. I was excited at the thought of watching unlimited movies and tv shows for one low price a month! Of course the fact that I didn't have to deal with the discs was a nice added bonus. I re-signed up with Netflix and couldn't wait to get the Roku party started!
<p> The device was very easy to install and the instructions were clearly explained too. Within about 10 minutes everything was hooked up and ready to go. I had hundreds of TV shows and movies at my fingertips! You can search by movie genre for specifically what you're interested in. The quality is excellent and it's like watching a movie in the theater or from a true DVD. Sometimes the connection will be a bit slower than normal, but that's to be expected. I haven't had any issues with the connection not working at all. You can browse the selections with the included remote. I love seeing old TV shows from years and years ago, it's fun to watch them again. I know that this little black box is going to revamp my movie nights completely! I'm excited to watch many movies that I've never seen before.
<p> The Roku would be the perfect gift for any movie or TV buff. They will absolutely love it if you surprise them with it.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Roku for providing me with a complimentary unit in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

I will be awarding one lucky random winner $20 paypal or $20 Amazon gift card (your choice.) I know I am 691 away but that's really not that many! If you tell your friend and they tell their friend and they tell their friend, etc it can go very quickly!
