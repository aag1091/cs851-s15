<p> It's always fun to challenge your palate and introduce yourself to new foods. Of course we all have our resident favorites, but why not spice it up a little? Dr. Praeger's is here to open up a whole new world of culinary delight to you! Go ahead and dive right in!
<p> It all started in 1994 when successful New Jersey cardiac surgeon Dr. Peter Praeger and his medical partner, Dr. Eric Somberg, helped keep a family business alive. They bought Ungar’s Gefilte Fish – a popular food company within the Jewish and Yiddish communities. The doctors set out on a simple mission – to help people see nutritious food in a new light. They expanded the company to include all-natural and sensible products that would appeal to a wider consumer base. They kept the Ungar’s brand, which includes the original gefilte fish and other traditional Jewish foods, and developed Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods, which now includes dozens of all-natural, kosher frozen foods.
<p> Dr. Praeger's philosophy is that good-for-you food should actually taste good, especially if you don’t let artificial ingredients, colors and fillers get in the way. That’s why our products are made with ingredients you recognize, including flash-frozen vegetables and fish from cold Northern waters. Our hearty California Veggie Burger doesn’t conceal its tasty spinach, broccoli, peas, carrots and onions –it puts them right where you can see and taste them! And our gluten-free options are an easy way to keep wheat out of your diet, while keeping the good things in, like fiber and taste bud-pleasing flavor.
<p> Winner will be chosen on January 17, 2012 at 10 pm and then will be emailed. One entry per day. Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours. Thank you and good luck!

<p> There's nothing quite like cake. The delectably moist and fluffy confectionary treat is something that I just can't get enough of, especially if it's fresh out of the oven. A slice of chocolate cake is one of my favorite desserts, although I don't discriminate against cake. Do you know what's even better than a piece of cake on a plate? Cake on a stick, of course!
<p> BakePops are the latest sensation and now you can make these delicious treats in your own home! It's so easy! Just fill the specially designed Bake Pop pan with ANY cake mix, put on the custom lid and pop it in the oven. Before you know it, you'll have 24 bite-sized cake pops ready to decorate and eat!
<p> I bet you can already picture making fantastic Bakepops with the cake mix of your choice, right? Of course you can't forget to decorate it your yummy treat on a stick. The possibilities are endless too, which is the fun part! How about a chocolate Bakepop with vanilla icing drizzled on it? Maybe a yellow cake Bakepop with peanut butter icing and rainbow sprinkles is more up your alley? Whatever you choose, I'm sure it will be very delicious.
<p> This project would be a fun winter weekend afternoon project to do with your child. They will love being able to spend time with mom and have a treat too! It's also good for an adult too!
<p> Bakepops are wonderful for parties and social events. Impress your friends or family with a tray full of Bakepops at your next party. They will love it!

<p> Vacation and relaxation are two words that definitely go hand in hand. It's important to make some time for yourself on a regular basis and de-stress. When I booked my vacation to the Bahamas, I knew that I would love to incorporate a massage into my trip. I contacted the Royal Suite Day Spa in Nassau, Bahamas and the rest was history!
<p> The Royal Suite Day Spa is a lovely spa that is located inside of the Hilton hotel in Nassau. When you walk in, you're welcomed by a very friendly staff who is happy to provide you with any spa service of your choice. The spa offers a variety of massages, manicures, pedicures, facials, body scrubs, reflexology, body wraps, and much more. Special package deals are available too. Your stress will be instantly melted away when you leave the spa.
<p> My boyfriend and I were able to receive a couple's massage which was excellent! Who doesn't love to be pampered?
<p> The massage was fantastic and I felt comfortable and relaxed throughout the whole session. The lights were dimmed, soothing music was played, and soft candles were lit. I can't imagine anything more perfect, can you? There was even a small fruit plate for us too. I received a massage from Ketra, who is the spa manager. She performed her magic on me and worked out all the kinks and tension in my back. I loved every minute of it! The pressure she used was perfect, it wasn't too hard but just right. I instantly noticed the difference in how I felt after the massage versus when I came in to the spa. My stress level was down and I felt much more relaxed. I couldn't ask for a better experience. The only complaint I had was that the massage was over way too soon! :) Once you leave the spa, you're surrounded by the backyard of the Hilton hotel which offers lush plants, a pool, and a nice sitting area.
<p> My boyfriend also enjoyed his massage as well. He had some back pain and all of the pain was whisked away by magical fingers. He felt fantastic afterwards and loved the massage too. The staff was extremely professional and made sure your needs were taken care of.
<p> If you're ever in Nassau, I highly recommend visiting the Royal Suite Day Spa. You will not be disappointed.

<p> I'm a big fan of Victoria's Secret Pink collection. I have their sweatpants, underwear, bras, and hoodies. The clothing is made well and washes excellently. The patterns and designs on the items are always eye-catching and adorable. I'm always on the lookout for new Pink items to get my hands on!
<p> Victoria's Secret is inspired by a love for lingerie, and the desire to bring beauty—and fantasy—into every woman’s wardrobe. They believe little luxuries are of grand importance. And what’s closest to your body is always closest to their heart. Victoria's Secret sells a range of different items besides lingerie. They offer sleepwear, cosmetic &amp; skincare items, and more! The items are quality made and last.
<p> I was contacted by VS because they knew I liked the Pink line. Their newest products are NFL branded hoodies, underwear and sweats from all 32 teams. I was sent a Denver Broncos hipster panty gift set. The set contains 3 pairs of underwear branded with a Broncos graphic.
<p> I have many pairs of Victoria Secret's underwear and they are always comfortable and fit well. The underwear in this gift set was also very comfortable as well to wear. The underwear came packaged in a cute gift set that was tied with a bow. I liked the presentation of it. One pair is blue and has a sparkly orange graphic that says "touchdown" on the back, the other pair is white and has "I *DISCLOSURE* I received the product in exchange for this review.

<p> I'll be gone from Sunday the 25th to January 1st. I'm going on a cruise to the Bahamas! I'll try and post some new content for you this weekend to tide you over until I get back. Have a wonderful Christmas!

<p> Sammi's Blog of Life is now 2 years old. I can't believe it's been 2 years. This blog was just an idea and a dream in the beginning, now it's definitely reality. Thank you followers for making this blog what it is!
<p> I generally cook a few times a week. Some days I'm lazy, or I'm really tired after work and don't feel like it. Most people just have a few take out choices in their area (pizza and Chinese are the staples, I'm sure you have others though.) One of the benefits of living in NYC is that EVERY restaurant offers take out and delivery. No matter what you're craving, Delivery.com makes it available!
<p> Delivery.com is a leading destination for local online ordering! Since 2004, they have been connecting people like you with merchants in their neighborhoods. Their mission is to provide their users with fast, convenient delivery and pickup from all of their favorite restaurants and stores.
<p> The service is truly great. Are you craving pad thai from your favorite neighborhood Thai place, but don't feel like picking it up? No problem! You can order online and in practically no time, your doorbell will ring and your food will be there! Delivery.com accepts credit cards and cash. You can even write in special instructions with your order, like no mayonnaise, no mustard, etc. I love that Delivery.com takes the restaurant to you! You also accumulate points from each order you make. You can use the points to cash out to get items like Delivery.com tshirts, keychains, all the way up to a Macbook computer!
<p> Besides being able to order food, you're able to order groceries, catered foods, wine and liquor, and any specialty items from a butcher shop! Isn't that incredibly convenient?
<p> I used the service tonight to place an order. There were about 30 restaurants that I could choose from. I browsed the pages and saw pizza, Thai, Indian, diners, American, healthy, etc. All of the choices were a little overwhelming at first. I finally settled on sushi. My order was easy to place. You just select which items you want and then follow the instructions to pay. The menu is laid out in front of you with clear descriptions of the food and the prices. It couldn't be any simpler! You also receive an email immediately confirming your order.
<p> My food came very quickly and it was fantastic to have food brought to me instead of me having to cook it. It was a nice change. :)
<p> Delivery.com offers gift certificates which would be great for a college student who just moved to NYC and needs to brush up on their cooking skills. I highly recommend Delivery.com for any of your take out needs. It's also handy for last minute holiday shopping needs too!

<p> It's hard to control cravings during the holiday season. The abundance of holiday cookies, cakes, pies, and candy is right under our noses. How can we not give in to temptation with fabulous chocolate and treats? That's what New Years Resolutions are for. For now, just enjoy yourself with a moderate amount of sweets. :)
<p> GoMaxGo products are delicious candy bars that are lip smackin' good. All of the candy bars are dairy free and vegan, and have no trans fats. They also have no hydrogenated oils, no cholesterol, and contain nothing artifical! It's about time that you can have something delicious that isn't totally junky and terrible for you. If you're a fan of candy bars that contain chocolate, nougat, caramel, peanuts, peanut butter, and coconut, you'll absolutely love these! A candy bar is chocolate perfection in a rectangular shape and should be enjoyed every so often!
<p> As you can see, the candy bar wrappers are immediately catch your attention with their fun labels and large letters.
<p> All of the bars sound delicious, don't you think? The first one that I was drawn to was Cleo's. There's nothing like the combination of chocolate and peanut butter together, it's the best!
<p> I've been a big fan of Reese's for a long time. I somehow figured these cups would be much better than Reese's, and I was right. After you taste Cleo's, you'll seriously never want to go back to Reese's. I can immediately taste the quality difference in Cleo's versus Reese's. Cleo's tastes much fresher and less sugary. The peanut butter in the candy bar was simply perfect. It was smooth, creamy and full of that luscious peanut butter flavor. The chocolate was also fantastic. It was sweet and full-flavored. There was a thick layer of peanut butter inside the cup which I absolutely loved. These cups were seriously the best peanut butter chocolate treat I've had in a long time. I ate both cups instantly and wished that Max's sent more as I only received one pack! I HIGHLY recommend these! So delicious! These are vegan and dairy free but do not taste it all. It tastes just like regular candy.
<p> I had a few bites of the Mahalu next. I love coconut in candy and this transformed me to the Caribbean in the middle of winter! The coconut was sweet, flakey, and full of great flavor. The almonds gave the candy bar a nice added crunch and the chocolate was bursting with sweet flavor too. This candy bar will definitely curb that sweet tooth of yours. Pair with a glass of milk and you're good to go!
<p> I haven't tried any of the other four candy bars yet, but I will surely do so soon! I don't think they stand a chance against my sweet tooth. :)
<p> If you're looking for a fantastic candy bar that isn't filled with artificial ingredients, turn to GoMaxGo!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win all six varieties of GoMaxGo candy bars.

<p> I keep telling myself I really need a bigger closet. My shoes are basically exploding out of my closet! I can't help it if I see a pair I love though. ;) Shoes most certainly make any outfit complete, and I love to accessorize.
<p> Shoe Dazzle offers women's shoes, handbags and jewelry personally selected for you each month by their fashion experts. The items are based on your selections from a style profile that you make. Every item is just $39.95 plus free shipping. Shoe Dazzle is amazing. How many times have you gone shopping and have not seen any items you like? It happens to me constantly. With Shoe Dazzle you'll be guaranteed to like every single item you receive, because it will be sent from your style selections!
<p> If you're looking for fun and fashionable costume jewelry, beautiful handbags, or adorable shoes, look no further than ShoeDazzle. Surprise someone with a ShoeDazzle gift card and they will be in shoe bliss! :)
<p> I previously did a ShoeDazzle review a few months ago. I loved the company so much that I couldn't wait for an opportunity to do another one soon!
<p> Since the holidays are approaching, I knew I wanted to review a pair of shoes that I could wear for New Years Eve. I'll actually be on a cruise on NYE, so I knew I wanted something fancy or the evening.
<p> I finally settled on a gorgeous pair of heels. From the minute I saw them, I fell in love!The shoes fit me wonderfully. I don't think I've previously owned shoes with a heel this high. It's actually not that hard to walk in, surprisingly. I'm only 5'0, so I'll take any extra height I can get! The shoes are a pretty deep black color and I love the rhinestone detail on the top of the heel. It's very pretty and adds some some nice glitz for NYE! The shoes seem well constructed and quality made too, which is always nice. My dress that I'll be wearing that night is black and pink, so the shoes will match nicely. I love to dress up and it's always nice to have a new pair of heels. Thanks to ShoeDazzle for making me dazzle with my new shoes! :)

<p> Nothing captures the holidays more than sparkling beverages. These delectable, tasty beverages truly represent the holiday season to me. Serve a sparkling cranberry mock tail with a slice of lime on the side for a fun non-alcoholic drink. You can even use the cranberry juice as a mixer too, if desired. With some yummy hors d'oeuvres on the side, your guests will be partying in style.
<p> I've been aware of R.W. Knudsen beverages for years and they are always quality made and truly delicious. The fact that they are produced without any unnatural additives makes it all the better for me. These drinks are best served ice cold.
<p> I was sent four bottles of delicious sparkling drinks. They all looked fantastic and I couldn't wait for the taste test. I received cranberry, apple, blueberry and pear. These drinks would be fantastic for Christmas, and they would also make a fantastic New Years Eve drink, if you don't drink alcoholic beverages.
<p> The celebratory beverages are packed in elegant champagne-style bottles, perfect for special occasions. Why not have them for a pop of color on your holiday table, or give them as a hostess gift?
<p> The apple was my absolute favorite. The pale yellow color was very nice, it almost looked like wine! The beverage was delicious and very refreshing. You could definitely taste the apple flavor, but the flavor wasn't overwhelming. The taste of the apple was very fresh. I liked that the beverage was organic, which is important to me. The juice was sweet, but not overly sugary. When you sampled the beverage, the taste of apple was prevalent, as was the carbonation. The carbonation was not over the top, but gave the beverage some much needed pizazz. The bubbles most certainly make the drink.
<p> The blueberry was also great. The color of it was a deep blueish almost purple color that was just gorgeous. The flavor of blueberry was prominent. Sometimes blueberry drinks can taste artificial, but this truly did taste like fresh blueberry juice. The carbonation level was subtle but noticeable. I loved the combination of sweet, tart blueberries with addictive fizziness. It's a pairing that you can't go wrong with.
<p> I don't like pears much, so the pear beverage was not one of my favorites. I tried it and it wasn't bad though. If you do like pears, you'll definitely love this beverage.
<p> The cranberry beverage was the last one I tried. I enjoyed this one as well. It had a gorgeous rosy color that I absolutely loved. The taste of it was sweet, but not overly sweet. I love cranberries so I knew that I would really enjoy this beverage. The level of the bubbles were perfect, not too much but just right. The drink was tart, just like how fresh cranberries were. The tart taste matched with the fizziness was right on key. It was smooth going down and left you wanting more long after your glass was emptied. This drink would be great served with a nice slice of pie or cake.
<p> I highly recommend R.W. Knudsen beverages for your Christmas holiday.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking THREE (3) winners for this contest. Three winners will win an assortment of celebratory beverages from R.W. Knudsen.

<p> I finally stepped into 2011 (well almost 2012!) by getting a smart phone. For years I had a regular, ordinary cell phone. Yes, I got teased on a consistent basis. I work in an industry where I need to be readily accessible to my phone and email. I decided to get an iPhone 4S. Of course when you get a new phone, you have to accessorize it, right?
<p> DomeSkin is specially designed to protect your device while allowing you to personalize it with your own unique custom style. DomeSkin products can be easily removed from the device and come off totally clean thanks to the patented 3M technology used in the construction.
<p> Unlike thin vinyl based skins, DomeSkin products are reusable and they provide an additional 3D layer of protection. The clear dome design not only offers a customizable stylish 3D look for your device, it also inhibits slipping and allows better gripping of the device. DomeSkin products are scratch-resistant and much more durable than other thin vinyl skin products.
<p> DomeSkin offers skins for the iPhone, iPod, iPad, and any version of the Blackberry. The designs come in a range of patterns, colors, and styles. I like that DomeSkin offers such a variety to choose from. There is definitely something for anyone. Whether you like polka dots, sports, abstract, zebra print, or flowers, they have you covered and more.
<p> I've had cases for my phone before that were impossible to get off. They practically became attached to the phone and it was really annoying. I knew that I didn't want to have that issue again.
<p> When I had the chance to review some iPhone skins, I was excited. I took my time browsing the pages. I finally settled on zebra pink and fluer de lys.
<p> These two styles instantly stuck out to me. The patterns are bright, bubbly, and fun. The colors are really vivid too. I also really like how they have a 3D look. I like my phone cases to reflect my taste. The skins were very easy to put on and I had no issues at all.
<p> The packaging has the front and back skin inside. They are not connected. First you put on the front skin, then the back one. I have the pink zebra skin on my phone right now. I really love it! The skins are sticky and adhere well to your device, not to mention that they are high quality too. The skin is thicker than most skins, but it still maintains a slim look to the phone, which is impressive. The skin does protect the phone somewhat too. I like that the skin does not obstruct the side controls of my iPhone, like some cases sometimes do. Another good feature of the product is that the skin is reusable. If you decide you want to give your phone a makeover, it's not a problem. It comes off easily and clean, leaving no residue or material behind.
<p> The skin is scratch-proof. Do you sometimes place your electronic devices down hard on a table or desk? Or do you let your phone rattle around in your purse? No worries, your phone will be protected and the case will be scratch-free.
<p> The only issue I have with this case is that the skin sometimes sticks to objects. It's not a huge downfall, it's just something to get used to. If it does stick to something, it's easy to remove.
<p> Overall, I'm really happy with these cases and my iPhone looks great in them! Anything from DomeSkin would make the perfect gift for that tech-junkie in your life.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a product of their choice from DomeSkin.

<p> There's nothing better than chocolate. Well pasta and carbs are good, but chocolate of course tops them. There is nothing that comes between me and my chocolate. I don't discriminate with the confectionery treat. Chocolate cake, cookies, ice cream, and pie? Brownies too you say? Yes please! I always love to try new chocolate sweet treats just to expand my chocolate horizon. :)
<p> Asher's Chocolates offers an award-winning selection of chocolates and other sweets—from assorted pralines to our chocolate-smothered pretzels and creamy fudge. They also have one of the largest (and most delicious) lines of sugar-free chocolates in the country.
<p> Their original family recipes began with Chester A. Asher. He was a Scottish farm boy from Canada, with a passion for chocolates and a knack for getting to the heart of a sugar craving. Always on the hunt for new ways to delight his customers, he was ever perfecting his creations, jotting new recipes down on bags of sugar.
<p> Today, they use the freshest, purest ingredients, just as Chester did. They also never skimp on deliciousness. Though their company has expanded over the years, they continue to treat our customers and employees like family. Asher’s Chocolates are made with love.
<p> Asher's is most certainly the gateway to chocolate heaven. I am sure the gate is made out of chocolate too. :) Your sweet tooth can be satisfied like no other with goodies from Asher's.
<p> I was sent a box of pecan caramel patties. How can you go wrong with chocolate, pecans, and caramel?
<p> These little bite-size pieces of heavenly goodness were delicious! They are the perfect size for a mid-day snack or dessert that leaves you feeling guilt-free. The chocolate was sweet and flavorful. The pecans gave the treat a nice crunch which I love in candy. The candy was also chewy, but not overly chewy. The caramel was sweet, gooey, and just utterly perfect. You could taste each individual ingredient, but everything came together and combined perfectly for a perfect balance. The candy was very fresh and had a quality taste. I really had to control myself not to do overdo it! It's easy to trick yourself into thinking it's okay to have more than one because they are small, but it's easy to fall into the chocolate trap! These would go great with a glass of white wine, or a nice icy cold glass of milk.
<p> Anything from Asher's would make a perfect hostess gift, birthday present, or a just thinking of you present. Hopefully the recipient will share. :)
