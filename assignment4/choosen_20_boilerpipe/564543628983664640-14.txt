<p> Nothing in life is better than chocolate. There's just something about that sweet, rich, luscious chocolate that can make any bad day instantly melt away. Not to mention how great tasting it is! A fabulous piece of chocolate cake or a sinfully delicious cheesecake brownie is just what you need after a long day.
<p> Pillsbury offers fresh-from-the-oven baked goods that have made mealtimes special times for nearly 140 years. You all know the delicious crescent rolls, sweet cinnamon rolls, and the fabulous oven ready cookies and cake mixes that Pillsbury makes.
<p> Pillsbury has recently added a new product to its fantastic line up, Pillsbury Sweet Moments bite size brownies. I received two bags to try in the flavors of caramel cheesecake and raspberry cheesecake. They were the most delicious brownies that I think I've had in a very long time.
<p> Raspberry Cheesecake
<p> These cheesecake bites are bite-sized pieces of heaven. They are so incredibly delicious and honestly I ate more than I should have! On the outside there is a great chocolate shell with a pretty pattern etched on the top. These are best served cold so you an enjoy all of the flavors at once at the peak of its perfection. Upon biting into the square of chocolate that holds the key to my heart, this is what you see;
<p> I love how each layer is distinct. First the creamy cheesecake followed by the tart raspberry layer, completed by a fabulous layer of fluffy chocolate. Each layer has its own distinctive taste and is not masked by the other flavors. You can taste each flavor equally. The cheesecake is rich, creamy and full of flavor. That's the first flavor I noticed when I bit into the brownie bite. Soon after the sweet raspberry layer blanketed my tastebuds in raspberry bliss. Instantly after that I tasted the sweet and fabulous chocolate. All of the flavors combined together to produce a simply fantastic treat. I don't normally like raspberry filled sweets, but this was out of this world. These treats would be great paired with a glass of your favorite wine.
<p> Next, I sampled the caramel cheesecake brownie bites.
<p> I swear, Pillsbury had me in mind when creating this flavor. Anything caramel flavored is always near and dear to my heart. These have the same pretty design etched on the top of the brownie and have the same 3 layers inside like the raspberry brownie bites, except the raspberry is replaced by caramel. When I bit into the sweet treat, this is what I saw:
<p> Isn't that just perfection at its finest? This cool and creamy treat was just simply amazing. In my opinion, the colder the cheesecake it is, the better it tastes. The chill just brings out the taste more I think. When I bit into the treat, fireworks went off in my mouth! I tasted the fluffy cheesecake layer first which was followed by a sweet and decadent caramel layer. The caramel layer was ooey, gooey, sweet and just perfect. The caramel would have been awesome on its own but paired with a cheesecake layer and a chocolate layer? I could now die happy! The cheesecake paired fabulously with the fantastic caramel layer. Lastly, the chocolate layer joined the sweet fest. I couldn't believe how delicious this square piece of heaven was. I certainly could have eaten the entire bag at once but I had to control myself. Pair this confectionary treat with a delicious cup of steaming coffee and it will be the right way to end your day.

<p> CRUNCH! Did you hear that? That was the delicious crunch that a Frito-Lay potato chip has! I'm a big fan of Frito-Lay chips and have been enjoying them for years. They are always coming out with new flavors that are more delicious than the previous!
<p> For more than 75 years, Frito Lay has enjoyed making the best snacks on earth, starting with simple, farm-grown ingredients. They are not stopping now! They are contining to innovate, so they can provide tasty products that are good as well as fun. In 2011, approximately 50% of Frito-Lay's products will be made with all natural ingredients. That means no artificial flavors, ingredients or preservatives and no MSG. You get delicious snacks with no nutritional guilt. What could be better than that?
<p> Frito-Lay has recently come out with a new line of potato chips titled Regional Flavors. These chips were inspired by popular American regional cuisine and include the following flavors:
<p> All of the Lay’s Regional Flavored potato chips are made with all natural ingredients, and are cooked in healthier oils so they contain 0 grams of trans fats per serving!
<p> There’s also less sodium in them than you might think – a 1-oz serving of our Lay’s Regional Flavored potato chips contains less salt than a plain bagel!
<p> My taste from home recipe is a a perfect cobb salad with pieces of chipotle ranch chips in it. The cool ranch breaks up the chipotle spiciness and it also pairs very nicely with the lettuce and other ingredients in the salad. It's a great summer lunch. I was eating the chips one day and I was thinking how they provide a great crunch that is very addictive. I always like having a crunch in my salad so I decided to put them in it and the rest is history! It's been a match made in heaven. :)

<p> Jewelry and clothes go hand in hand. It's important to accessorize and pair your favorite outfits with fun and unique jewelry. I love when I find a jewelry collection that offers unique and refreshing pieces that stand out from what everyone else is wearing.
<p> Daniel Vincent is a New York City jewelry designer. His sterling silver jewelry is inspired by mother natures most beautiful creation, the rose. Daniel creates bracelets, rings, earrings, pendants, and necklaces. All of the creations are handcrafted in sterling silver or sterling with a 18k yellow gold vermeil. They are completed with an antique finish that give the collection its one of a kind rustic charm. The jewelry is so unique and unlike any that I have ever seen before.
<p> I was sent an assortment of jewelry for review purposes. I received: Large Stone Onyx Pendant
<p> This pendant is absolutely beautiful. I can tell it was hand-crafted and Daniel Vincent most likely spent hours creating it and the end result is simply gorgeous. I really love antique and antique looking jewelry so this necklace is right up my alley. The onyx stone is beautiful and I love how large it is. Two gorgeous roses sit alongside the edge of the stone. Even though you notice the roses, they don't take away from the star of the show, the onyx. I like how the jewelry has equal balance and you can appreciate the piece as a whole. The clasp on the chain is easy to put on and remove and the necklace is not heavy at all to wear. I love the way it looks on and it lays well and I didn't have to adjust it all when I wore it.
<p> 3 Rose Band Set Silver Ring
<p> The rings are a lot smaller in person then they look in the picture. Again, I love the antique feel of the rings a lot. I wear rings on a daily basis and I constantly change them, so it's nice to have more to add to my weekly variety. The set is a tad bit big on, but I will have to get a ring guard or something to make them a little bit more secure on my finger. Even though they are big, I do like the way it looks on. You can wear the ring as a set or wear one by itself too. I love how one ring has a large rose on it, while the other has a very small rose so as to make the set not too overwhelming. The ring is made with quality materials and made to last. The silver has an antique finish to it and the roses are just so pretty. When I tried the set on it was comfortable to wear, it did not feel heavy and I didn't have any issues when it was on my finger.
<p> Vine Heart Necklace
<p> This necklace is my absolute favorite piece out of everything I received. It's so pretty! I love how there's a "vine" wrapped around the outer perimeter of the heart. It's so unique and different. There are a few roses dotted across the vine and it's a nice touch. The only complaint I have with the necklace is that I don't love how the chain is put on. It's on the side of the necklace instead of through the top loop of the heart. Since it's on the side of the necklace, when you wear it lays on an odd angle and you have to fix it to correct it. This necklace is multi-functional, which I love. It would look great at the office and double as a nice evening necklace as well.
<p> High Double Rose Ring
<p> This ring fit me very well actually and I really like it. I've used it as a cocktail ring when going out at night because the rose is so high up and large that it looks like it could be a large stone. The rose has such personality and is created so nicely! I've gotten compliments on it and people have asked me where I got it from. I said Daniel Vincent, a NYC jewelry designer of course! I love the wide band of the ring, which of course supports the large rose on top. The ring is comfortable to wear and hasn't given me any trouble.
<p> Any piece from Daniel Vincent's collection would be a great gift for a flower or rose lover, or even just a jewelry lover! Surprise a friend or family member with a necklace from the collection today, they will absolutely love it! :)
<p> Nickelodeon today is not what it once was when I grew up in the 90's. Kids who watch the network today are missing out on the great shows that Nickelodeon had in its heyday.
<p> Hey Arnold!, one of the most beloved animated Nickelodeon series from the 1990s, arrives in stores nationwide for the first time on August 9, 2011, from Shout! Factory.

Long anticipated by fans, Hey Arnold!: Season One has not been available in stores until now.
<p> I used to watch this show when I was a kid and I really enjoyed it. The show would be great for Hey Arnold fans and even kids who didn't grow up watching the show would enjoy it as well. The show is easy to love and there is always some adventure in the plot line going on.
<p> Created by Craig Bartlett as a comic in 1986, Hey Arnold! debuted as an animated short for the Nickelodeon film Harriet the Spy in 1996. Hey Arnold! went on to air on Nickelodeon from 1996 to 2001. The show also aired on "Nick on CBS" from 2002 until 2004.

<p> Are you a frequent customer of Starbucks? Do you wish you could create those delicious speciality coffeehouse style drinks at home? Well now you can and you can save a lot of money by doing so!
<p> Capresso is the mecca website of coffee machines for coffee lovers. Capresso offers espresso machines, coffee machines, coffee grinders and coffee beans, water kettles and frothers, and various parts and accessories for coffee machines. If you're in the market for a fantastic coffee machine, look no further than Capresso.
<p> I was sent a Capresso Froth Pro for review.
<p> Designed to create thick and rich frothed milk for cappuccinos, steamed milk for café lattes, and frothy hot chocolate, the handy new Capresso froth PRO automatic milk frother produces professional quality results with a quick touch of a button. Three temperature settings – hot, warm and cold – open up a variety of options for delicious beverages with a creative touch.
<p> Compact, yet powerful, the froth PRO is an ideal compliment to any coffee maker or espresso machine, plus it’s the perfect stand-alone appliance for anyone who loves hot chocolate. The unit has the capacity to quickly produce 8 ounces of rich and creamy frothed milk, or 12 ounces of hot chocolate or perfectly steamed milk for latte macchiato or café latte.
<p> The three temperature settings ensure milk is frothed or heated to perfection for each beverage. The warm setting is ideal for preparing hot chocolate for children or anyone who wants to be careful that their milk is not too hot, while the cold setting creates new possibilities for tempting iced summer drinks based on coffee, espresso or gourmet tea.
<p> Using a unique patent-pending frothing disk, the froth PRO creates a perfect frothing action, gently but quickly whipping air into the milk while heating it to the desired temperature. Easy to use, simply pour the chilled milk into the scratch-resistant non-stick milk pitcher and place the lid on top. Press one of the illuminated control buttons to choose hot, warm or cold, and then the froth PRO goes into action, creating thick and rich frothed or steamed milk that is ready to be served immediately. The stay-cool handle allows the user to safely pick up the pitcher and pour immediately.
<p> Doesn't this machine look awesome? I drink coffee on a regular basis now and I've been trying to cut back on buying expensive drinks at Starbucks and other coffee shops. I was very excited when I had the chance to review this product because I knew I would be able to make beautiful drinks at home and save a lot of money. The machine is a sleek black color that is small enough to be kept on your counter top next to your coffee or espresso machine.
<p> The machine is very easy to use and in seconds I was adding frothed milk to a delicious latte. Any type of milk will froth perfectly. Use your favorite type of milk, whether it might be 1%, whole, almond milk, 2%, skim, soy milk, rice milk, and even chocolate milk! The froth is luscious and thick and blanketed the top of my latte perfectly. The frothed milk tasted like it was made by a barista in my kitchen and handed to me instantly after! I think it would be fun to experiment with different types of milk for a unique taste on your favorite classic coffee drinks. Kids will also enjoy frothed milk on top of their hot chocolate in the fall and winter seasons. Have them help you so they can get in on the fun too!
<p> A great feature of the machine is the smart design that includes dual auto shut-off for safety. There is a storage compartment in the bottom of the base to hold the two frothing discs and one heating disc that come with the unit. I love that everything can be stored together. How convenient! The milk pitcher is dishwasher safe, and the base can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth.
<p> This frother is the perfect gift for any coffee lover. Send it to them today and they will be thanking you with a delicious homemade coffee beverage the next time you see them! :)

<p> Clothes are something I absolutely love. I very much enjoy going shopping and seeing what the latest fashion trends and styles are. There's just something so fun about pairing gorgeous clothes with great jewelry to compliment your style.
<p> Impel Clothing is a modest women's boutique specializing in extra long layering tees, lace tops, and vintage inspired clothing. Are you looking for adorable printed and patterned tops, tanks, and tees? How about jeans, dresses, and accessories? Look no further than Impel! The items at Impel are quality made and look great on.
<p> I was sent a blue steel cami for review.
<p> This cami is great! I love the bright blue color, it's so cheerful and happy. The color is absolutely perfect for summer. The top fits me well and is not too tight or clingy like some cami's can be. It is slightly stretchy too. I love the way it looks on. It holds up well in the wash and and the colors did not bleed nor did any of the fabric become loose. The top looks cute with a skirt or capri's and some netural colored sandals. It can also be worn with pajama pants or under a sweater in the winter.
<p> Halloween is just around the corner! Have you thought about what your children will be dressing up as this year? It's not too late to start thinking about it now. I don't dress up anymore, nor do I have any children to dress up. That doesn't stop me from putting a costume on my dog though. Last year she was an angel, and the year before that a princess :).
<p> Costume Discounters offers the lowest prices on costumes possible. They have men, women, children's, and pet costumes. You can't forget dog costumes either. The costumes range in popular styles (Cinderella, Winnie The Pooh, Batman, etc.) Costume Discounters also offers theme costumes (baseball, basketball, and also 20's, 30's, 40's, and 50's themed, etc.) Holiday themed costumes are also available. I can guarantee that you will find the costume that you are looking for at a great price.
<p> I picked out the cutest costume for my Colby! For Halloween this year she will be a Kandy Korn!
<p> This costume is so cute! I really wanted to get a picture of her in the costume but she just wouldn't sit still enough for me to get a good picture. She looked absolutely adorable! I've never seen a cuter costume for a pet before. I've put costumes on her before that she's immediately tried to get off (specifically anything with a hat) but she had no problem with this Kandy Korn hat. It must have been comfortable for her. The hat fit her head well and was easy to move into place if she made it become askew. The cape was equally as cute and fit around her back and neck well and stayed in place securely. I think she knew that she looked cute because she kept running around and wagging her tail and looking at me. :) The colors on the costume are bright and vivid. They truly represent a candy corn very well. The costume seems to be made well. It is not machine-washable but has to be hand-washed. I can't wait for the kids to see her costume on Halloween, I know she will love them and they will love her too! :)

<p> When I think of a pen, Sharpie is the first brand to come to mind. Sharpie offers fine quality writing utensils that write beautifully. I love that the brand comes in so many different styles and colors, depending on what you need it for.

<p> Even though it's still summer and very hot outside, that doesn't stop me from wearing slippers. Generally when I'm home, I go barefoot. Sometimes my feet get cold though and I like to put on a cozy pair of slippers. Style is always a key component of my wardrobe and that carries over to my footwear as well! :)
<p> In the high-mountain valley known as Staheekum, the rivers run cold,the mornings are brisk and the winters come early. Yet its residents remain comfortably warm right down to their feet, due in no small part to StaheekumBrand Slippers. Inside, natural sheepskin caresses your feet; outside a velvetynatural upper surrounds them. Yet despite this unparalleled level of comfort,Staheekums are as rugged as their namesake landscape thanks to handcraftedconstruction using the finest natural materials. Staheekum is synonymouswith comfortable surrounds. Whether that's from the valley's reputationor slippers is often debated late into the night.
<p> Staheekum offers men's, women's and children's slippers. Each pair is finely crafted by hand and has the softest sheepskin lining. Whether you're looking for a moccasin, clog, or boot style slipper, Staheekum has you covered and more. Even though it's still summer, fall is just around the corner. Why not pamper yourself, a friend or relative with a pair of Staheekum slippers? Their feet will thank you on those chilly fall nights!
<p> I was sent a pair of Staheekum wheat clog sheepskin lined slippers. I absolutely love them!
<p> Classic Sheepskin lined clog-style slipper with natural suede on the outside. Easy on and off construction. The clog comes with cuffed sheepskin detailing and a flexible non-slip rubber sole for wear inside and outside.
<p> These slippers are absolutely divine! I don't like slippers that cover your entire foot. I need slippers that are easy to slip on and off and these are perfect for doing just so. I love the neutral wheat color of the top of the slipper. It reminds me of sitting inside on a cold winter's day enjoying a nice cup of hot tea while watching the snow fall. The sheepskin lining is extremely comfortable and very soft to walk in. I like that the sheepskin continues to the outside of the shoe too and is featured on the cuff. It's a cute detail. The slippers fit me well and are very comfortable to walk in and the sheepskin keeps my feet warm. It's like walking on a sheepskin cloud! :) I also really like how the bottom has non-skin treads. I can tell that the slipper is made to last and I will be able to wear them for quite some time. I can't wait to regularly wear them in the upcoming cold months.
