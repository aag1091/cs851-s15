<p> You only live once and it's important to enjoy the finer things in life. Handcrafted shoes, purses, jewelry, and clothes are all items I love and own. It's important to me to look my best at all times. I value quality over quantity. I'd rather have one pair of expensive quality shoes that will last rather, than a pair of less expensive shoes that I will have to eventually replace. It's vital that you treat yourself every once in a while!
<p> Allen Edmonds shoes are sought throughout the world by men who appreciate true quality and American Classic styling. The company has been around since 1922 and the shoes are made from the highest quality products available. This company also offers shoe care kits, belts, accessories, and apparel. For any of your high-fashion needs, Allen Edmonds has you covered.
<p> The footwear offered is classic and timeless and looks great with practically any outfit you pair them with. The shoes that this company sells are absolutely gorgeous. Allen Edmonds offers many different styles for whatever shoe style and preference you're looking for. You can guarantee that the shoe will be built to last and you'll be very satisfied with it. Whether you want a lace up shoe, a casual shoe like a loafer, or even boots, your shoes needs will be met.
<p> When I was told that I could review another pair of shoes for my boyfriend, I was excited. Together we browsed the pages, our eyes shifting from one pair of beautiful shoes to the next. There were so many pairs that we both liked that it was hard to make a selection. Finally he settled on the Fiesole in tan waxed leather. A great choice, for sure. The shoes came insanely quick, within one day of placing the order! I was floored at how fast they shipped. The shoes were packaged excellently and came in a nice dustbag to store them in too.
<p> Look at these beauties!
<p> The waxed suede body on these fully lined slip-on loafers truly sets them apart from all of Allen Edmond's other Italian styles. Available in black, brown and tan, they have a distressed patina that is both modern and natural, promising to only get better with age. The thicker lug sole, another distinguishing feature, gives these Italian loafers a slightly more forceful character, further guaranteeing that the Fiesole is a shoe that everyone is sure to look up to.
<p> This was his second pair of Allen Edmonds shoes and he couldn't have been any happier. They were absolutely beautiful and fit like a dream and are comfortable. He had no trouble wearing them or walking in them. He was very excited to have them, and the shoes are flawlessly made and simply stunning. The handcrafted suede is soft and smooth. The stitching on the shoes is impeccable. The silver buckle on the front of the shoe is a wonderful elegant touch. The toasted brown color is classic and goes perfectly with dress pants or for a casual look too. That's the beauty of any pair of Allen Edmonds shoes, they work with whatever you're wearing.
<p> My boyfriend couldn't be any happier with this shoe. He can't wait to regularly wear it with some of his favorite shirts and jeans, and for work too!
<p> If you're looking for a quality pair of shoes for the man in your life, Allen Edmonds is the essential choice.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Allen Edmonds for providing me with a complimentary pair of shoes in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I love anything related to cooking. My kitchen has many different baking pans, baking tools, cookware, serveware, and of course gadgets. Cooking is something that I enjoy and I like to have the latest and hottest equipment to use in my kitchen. I love having items that nobody else has.
<p> Sagaform stands for joyful, innovative gifts for the kitchen and the set table. Indoors and outdoors. Joyful gifts for friends or family, or to spoil yourself with. Anything you could possibly want for the kitchen, Sagaform has. If you want colored wine glasses, funky colored ice cream dishes, serving dishes in the shape of animals, or even a tea set with a retro print, they have you covered. There's truly something for everyone at Sagaform. I like that these products are not the typical items that everyone has in their kitchen. When I was offered the chance to do a review, I was really excited. It was fun looking through the catalog at each product offered. Each page brought something new and different that I had never seen before. It did take me a while to select something as there were so many items that appealed to me. I knew I didn't want to choose something that I already had, but wanted to pick something that I did truly need. I was in the market for a new salad bowl and I saw a great one in the catalog that looked great.
<p> I finally settled on the Sunflower Salad Set with matching servers. This was to replace my old salad bowl set. I wanted something modern and fun. The bright yellow is very warm and inviting and brings extra joy to my kitchen. I like the wavy design of the rim of the bowl, it matches perfectly with the wavy salad servers. The salad servers and the bowl are great quality. The salad bowl is ceramic and is not flimsy at all, it has weight to it. The wooden servers are of high quality too. I used this salad bowl set for the first time last night. The bowl held a lot of salad and was quite roomy. The servers were easy to use and hold and gathered a lot of food into my bowl effortlessly.
<p> You could even get matching yellow or wooden bowls to make the set complete. The best part about the salad bowl is that you don't have to put only salad in it, you could put fruit, pasta, scrambled eggs, and anything else you could think of in it. Anything from Sagaform would make a wonderful housewarming present for that first time homeowner, or a great birthday present for the resident chef in your life.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Sagaform for providing me with the complimentary salad set in exchange for this review. All thoughts and ideas are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I'm a regular jewelry-wearer. I wear two rings everyday (that I never take off) and of course I don't leave my house without earrings either. My earrings are always the large hanging chandelier style ones. This weighs on my ears after a while and I have to take them off because they hurt. My rings are constantly turning and not sitting face forward either. Wouldn't it be nice to have products that would fix these issues? Your fashion dreams can now be fixed!
<p> Bling Guard has two signature fashion-fix products that I now cannot live life without. BlingDots are perfect for heavy earrings and are easy to apply. These discreet and disposable earring backs relieve the weight and pressure of your pierced earrings, while positioning them perfectly on your ears. BlingWraps keep your stunning rings on top, and stop them from turning, twisting or slipping off your finger. These wraps can add up to 1+ ring sizes and are easy-to-use, transparent and disposable. BlingWraps keep your rings looking beautiful while leaving you with the confidence to wear them all the time.
<p> I was sent a package of BlingDots and BlingWraps. These products are absolutely perfect for me and I feel much confidant when I wear my jewelry now.
<p> My rings are always slipping and twisting and it's annoying. The second I fix the ring to be face-forward, I feel like it slips and turns again. Even though my rings are my correct ring size, they've never fit 100% perfectly. Depending on my weight, my finger size sometimes fluctuates and my rings can even become loose. I worry that the rings will become too loose and I could actually lose them. BlingWraps are perfect for making sure your ring fits accurately. You can either wrap the BlingWrap on the inside of your ring, or around your finger and let the ring sit over it. I decided to put the wrap around my finger. The product was easy to apply and in no time my ring was sitting face forward and looking fabulous. The product is discreet and you can barely notice it's on. My ring did not slip or twist at all. It stayed perfectly forward, I was very impressed. If you receive a ring that is too big, just use BlingWraps on it, and it will always fit perfectly. I love that I'll never have to worry about my ring turning or twisting ever again!
<p> BlingDots have really helped my ears. Like I mentioned earlier I love to wear very heavy, hanging earrings. After about 4 or 5 hours of continuous wear, my ears start to feel the pressure of the earrings and they hurt. My only solution before BlingDots was to take the earrings off. I didn't like that because I would prefer to wear the earrings, but it's hard to tolerate pain. With BlingDots I can now wear my favorite earrings again and have support when I wear them too, which is excellent! The dots were easy to apply to my earrings and in no time I was wearing my favorite earrings again. I could not see the product on my earrings when I looked in the mirror. This time they were positioned perfectly and did not twist or turn at all. I felt confident and at ease knowing my ears were being supported and I was not doing them a disservice. I was actually able to wear the earrings all day with no pain! I didn't have to take them off once. I couldn't believe this!
<p> These products are truly lifesavers and I am not sure how I had never discovered them before. They make jewelry wearing so much easier, and a true pleasure! I strongly urge everyone to try BlingGuard if you haven't before.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a pack of BlingWraps and BlingDots.

<p> Having a small sink in the bathroom can be a pain when you want to do your hair. The sink is just not large enough to store a hair brush, hairspray, and curling iron on it all at once. Ladies, does this sound familiar? Balancing everything on top of the toilet to use as you need it is not ideal either. What can be done to solve this annoying problem? Don't fret, I have something to help your hair woes!
<p> The Hot Iron Holster is a brand new home and beauty product that solves the problem of where to put hot styling tools. The heat resistant silicone holster provides a convenient way to keep hot styling tools organized and safe in the home, at the salon, or on the go. The proprietary silicone material allows the Hot Iron Holster to cling to any smooth surface without suction cups or adhesives. The product is heat resistant up to 500 degrees F and can be used during heat up, while styling hair, and for cool down. The Hot Iron Holsters adds counter space to pedestal sinks, brings order to cluttered counter tops, and makes a perfect gift for women everywhere. The product comes in pink, purple, black, and white.
<p> This product revolutionizes your sinktop. It allows you to stop the crazy balancing act that in the end can hurt or burn you when your heated styling tools fall. This holster fits on any sink.
<p> This is a perfect invention for females everywhere. Why not put a can of hairspray and a hairbrush in the holster while you do your hair for easy access? Or you can put hair ties and a hairbrush in it too. I love that the holster comes in a variety of colors to match anyone's taste.
<p> The holster is a great item to review for the upcoming holiday season or because you love styling your hair &amp; wish you had more counter space. It makes a great gift too. The hot iron holster is completely portable and can either hang over a salon chair or cling on to the counter and keep the dangerous heated irons away from your beauty weapon slingin’ hands.

<p> The most annoying thing about a purse is the fact that it becomes a bottomless pit for anything you may need. You're always searching for the smallest object in the purse, like a chapstick. The item buries itself into a corner of the purse and leaves you searching for it and frustrated, for 5 minutes. Wouldn't life be easier if we could find exactly what we wanted immediately? Glass Handbag will make your purse dreams a reality.
<p> Glass Handbag has developed a revolutionary luxury designer handbag that includes an integrated light system. These functional and appealing lighted handbags are internationally patented and U.S. patent pending. Leave those annoyed and frustrated feelings behind about not being able to find what you need in your purse. Glass Handbag revolutionizes your purse in low light conditions. The handbags come in a range of different styles, colors, and patterns for anyone's taste.
<p> I was sent a gorgeous exotic snake print structured brown leather satchel. I absolutely love purses and was excited at the chance to review it. What girl doesn't love a great purse?
<p> The purse came excellently packaged and protected. It first was in a special Glass Handbag branded box. When you opened that, the purse was in a dust bag and tissue paper lined the branded box. I loved opening the package, it was like Christmas!
<p> This was inside once I opened the dustbag. Please admire its beauty! :)
<p> This purse is great for work or play, which is fantastic. I love the size of it, it holds everything I could possibly need. It can easily fit my cellphone, keys, light cardigan, a notebook, my ipad, wallet, and more! The light inside is easily my favorite part of the purse. When you open the bag, the light turns on, and when you close the bag it turns off. How awesome is that? I like that the light turns off by itself and doesn't stay on and drain the battery.
<p> The purse is constructed fabulously and it is a very high quality purse. The leather snakeskin pattern is very stylish and just my style. The leather smells wonderful, I keep smelling it! I love the gold hardware on the zippers and zipper closures, it compliments the snakeskin print very well. I've already used the purse once and it was very comfortable to carry, not heavy at all.
<p> There is so much storage in this bag, which is fantastic. There is a large zippered compartment on the outside of both sides of the purse, which could hold an eye glasses or sunglasses case, etc. There are two outside zippered pockets as well on each side of the purse on the bottom. On the inside, there is a very large zippered pocket which could hold your keys or an ID, etc. There are also 2 more additional zippered pockets on the other side of the interior of the purse. Anything you could possibly need to bring with you, this purse will hold.
<p> I'll be stylish this Fall when I carry my new snakeskin bag! The package came with a shoulder strap, but I like to carry the purse on the crook of my arm. If I change my mind, I can always attach the strap.
<p> If you're in the market for a Glass Handbag, now is the perfect time to buy one. The entire website is having a store wide reduction! Prices start from $280 and go to $420. Why not treat yourself to a new purse today? You deserve it!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Glass Handbag for providing me with this complimentary purse in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> What I love most about NYC is the fact that they care so deeply about certain causes and charities. There's always an important event going on that is very worth supporting.
<p> The Tunnel 2 Towers Run in NYC is a living, breathing memorial tribute to the memory of the heroic life and death of Stephen Siller, FDNY, all the 343 firefighters, and all first responders who sacrificed their lives that fateful day. It also includes those who perished on 9/11 as well. The foundation has established National Tunnel To Towers Runs across the country, so that we will never forget. These runs are a memorial tribute to the firefighters and others who surrendered their lives that day. This race is founded by Stephen's six brothers and sisters and is run 100% by volunteers. The race benefits the charity "The Stephen Siller, FDNY, Let Us Do Good Children's Foundation" which benefits children who have lost one or both parents.
<p> These are pictures from previous years.
<p> This year's event takes place on September 30th at the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. Come out to support our heroes of 9/11! Register now for the Tunnel to Towers Run - NYC, by using this link. If you're going this year, I'd love to see your pictures. If you cannot attend but would like to donate, please use this link.
<p> Please inform your friends and family of this fantastic event and cause!

<p> Learning a new language is not initially easy. You have to put in many hours of studying and training to be able to understand the language. I took 3 years of Spanish and 1 year of French. This was many years ago. I loved being able to speak the different languages, especially when I traveled to places that spoke those languages. If you've been wanting to learn a new language, now's your chance!
<p> Online Trainers is an e-learning platform which aims to make the learning of a foreign language much easier. Six different languages are offered (French, Spanish, English, Dutch, Italian and German). Instead of taking a course or class to learn, why not learn in the comfort of your own home on your own time? With an innovative language training solution and a dynamic online platform, you can access your learning materials from anywhere, any time. If you already know a language but want to brush up on it, or become fluent this would be a great program for you.
<p> Memorization is a very important aspect of the learning platform of Online Trainers. The program stimulates learner's capacity to stock information rather than only recognizing the words. Online Trainers explains that this platform helps the trainees to memorize a new language four times faster than traditional methods. They thus gain the confidence they have always wished to obtain. This is a much better way to learn then in a classroom environment.
<p> «Using this new method reduces costs. Since it is available on the Internet, it allows you to save money on transport costs. Moreover, unlike classical courses, its lessons are unlimited! Feel free to work for as long as necessary. Learning a language on your own time is convenient and can be stress free. The best part is you won't have to take the course for credit and be graded on your assignments!
<p> First things first! Where to start?
<p> A linguistic audit will help to answer that question. Based on vocabulary, grammar and oral comprehension, the audit helps to assess your current level in the language. This helps determine your personalized training. Online trainers cater to learners of all levels, including:
<p> BeginnerElementaryIntermediateAdvanced
<p> Furthermore, Online Trainers’s monitoring software closely tracks your performance and constantly analyzes your reactions during exercises in order to adjust the level of difficulty for each session.
<p> The software is attentive to your pace, and the learning process is, therefore, optimized.
<p> The program has been guaranteed to be successful in helping others learn the language, and even become fluent!
<p> If you're wanting to learn a new language, Online Trainers is a great place to begin.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:
<p> 1. I will be picking THREE (3) winners for this contest. Three winners will win 3 months of unlimited access to the program to learn whichever language they choose.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Surprises are the best, and my favorite! I love getting a package for my birthday or the holidays and having no idea what's in it. I enjoy the suspense and picturing what the contents are. So much of life is planned that it's truly a joy to receive a surprise once in a while.
<p> Mystery Box Shop is such a fun and unique concept. They sell mystery boxes in a range of different sizes that you can buy. Each box contains a certain amount of guaranteed items. The bigger the box, the more items inside. The contents are acquired from estates, storage units and salvage freight. What's inside each box is guaranteed to be worth more than you pay. What the best part of the box is that you can pick one meant for a man, woman, girl, or boy. With this choice you'll be sure that you won't receive army figurines meant for a 6 year old boy when you're a 50 year old woman. Mystery Box Shop donate a portion of their sales to the American Cancer Society, which I think is fantastic.
<p> I received a mystery box in the mail on Saturday. I was very excited when the mailman delivered it. It had some weight to it and I could't wait to open it! What could be inside? A candle? DVD's? Maybe jewelry? Who knows! I found the scissors and got to work opening the box.
<p> This is what I saw when the box was opened:
<p> I received the 4th season of Alfred Hitchcock presents on DVD, warm fuzzy socks, a ceramic pumpkin, a piece of jade, a book, a paint your own bank, Star Trek trading cards, solar dancing daisies, and a collectible coin. Not pictured is a shark tooth and some other coins. I also received a tiny vial with pieces of a Nantan meteorite inside! The paper inside provided some history of the meterorite.
<p> As you can see, I received a nice collection of items. I had a lot of fun going through each item as I went through the box. My favorite item is probably the meteorite, that's very cool. I like holding a piece of history in my hands! The book looks interesting and I will definitely be reading it in the next few weeks. I am also interested in the Alfred Hitchcock DVD, I love a good mystery! My boyfriend was interested in the Star Trek cards. The solar dancing daisies are cute and I could put them on a windowsill. The socks are very warm and cozy and perfect for the upcoming fall weather. I know a little girl who would love the paint your own bank too. I'm not sure what I will do with the jade and collectible coins, might just be fun to hold on to them. The ceramic pumpkin is perfect for displaying this fall.
<p> All in all, I enjoyed my mystery box. This would be perfect for buying for a friend or relative for Christmas or their birthday. The best part is they will have no idea what's inside, and neither will you. Make sure you ask them what they received!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a regular mystery box from Mystery Box Shop guaranteeing 10-15 items.

<p> Who doesn't love Musselman's applsauce and of course contests? I know I am a big fan of both of those things.
<p> Check out this exciting sweepstakes that begins next week for the Musselman’s Apple Sauce brand! As in previous years, they are sponsoring a nationally-televised ice skating show that will be broadcast on NBC. This year the show is the Musselman’s Apple Sauce Family Skating Tribute. Hosted by skating champions (and parents) Kristi Yamaguchi and Michael Weiss, the star-studded event features a live performance by Grammy Nominee Jewel, as well as other champion and Olympian skaters and their children.
<p> Starting 9/19/12, Musselman’s will begin running a Celebrate Family sweepstakes on its Facebook page at www.facebook.com/musselmans. For every new “like”, Musselman’s will donate $1 to the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF). Keeping families healthy is part of Musselman’s mission and donating to, and working with the NBCF is a big part of that mission.
<p> Once an individual “likes” the page, the fun begins. Each week Musselmna's will pose a question – does your family like “this” or do they “that”? Fans will answer the question and then be able to enter into a sweepstakes. They can enter one time each week. Entries tied to the first four questions (running 9/19/12 – 10/14/12) will go into a pool for a fabulous Grand Prize - a three-day/two-night trip for a family of four to Atlantic City to be guests at the Family Skating Tribute on November 3 (show will air on NBC on November 18). The winning family will receive hotel accommodations, admission for four to the event, round-trip coach air transportation and limousine service from and to the airport. They will also have an opportunity to meet with the skaters and with Jewel, making the Grand Prize a weekend the whole family will enjoy and remember for years to come.
<p> The second part of our Celebrate Family sweepstakes begins on 10/15/12 and runs through 12/16/12. Again, fans will answer a question and then complete a brief entry form to be entered into a drawing for a $100 Amazon gift card. Fans are able to enter one time each week . . . so there are lots of chances to win! To help encourage participation and further support the NBCF, Musselman’s will donate an additional $1 to NBCF for each entry it receives. *It’s a win-win. Fans get a chance to win prizes and the NBCF gets a larger donation with each entry.
<p> To make sure Musselman’s reaches its goal, they would greatly appreciate both your participation in the sweepstakes, as well as you helping them spread the word. It’s easy to enter:1) Go to the Musselman’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/musselmans and click the like button (if you have not done so already)2) Click on the Sweepstakes tab to go to the page to answer the “this or that” question3) Fill out an entry form for the sweepstakes4) Share the link with friends and family

<p> They say our eyes are the window to our soul. What they also fail to mention is that if we're tired, eyes showcase that. Dark circles and puffiness occur, which is less than attractive. Overtime wrinkles can form underneath eyes too. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a product that helped with all of those issues? Elavo Skincare is here to save the day.
<p> Elavo Skincare is a brand new skincare line created by Dr. Ahmet Altiner, a New York City based, board certified dermatologist. Dr. Altiner's goal was to create an easy, effective product line that was driven by the same patient-centric philosophy at the core of his practice. The product line contains cleansers, keratin scrubs, solar defense, and eye care products. Dr. Altiner wants you to look your best, and using this product line guarantees that.
<p> The Radiant Eyes product is perfect for reducing puffiness and dark under eye circles. I struggle with those constantly, and I'm sure other ladies do too. It's something that I really dislike.
<p> Elavo's Radiant Eyes antioxidant complex clinically reduces the appearance of dark circles, puffiness, and wrinkles by working on the cellular and surface level.

<p> Whenever I have a free moment online, I love to play games. Slots, Bingo, and Bejeweled are some of my favorites. When I pull the lever in my game of slots, I often wish that the 800,000 coins I won were real money. Online games relax me and provide me with a quick break of entertainment which is often needed, since I spend my days working and writing. Why not take 10 or 15 minutes and play your favorite game today?
<p> Gamesville is a hub for all things fun and games. If you're looking to play free games and compete for cash and prizes, this is the site for you! Gamesville features slots, card games, puzzle games, and more. Be careful though, the games are highly addictive! :) There are daily money drawings too. I haven't won yet, but I'll let you know when I do.
<p> One of my new favorite games from Gamesville is Reel Cash Critters. This is a slots game which I am in love with. The fast moving fruits, pictures, and numbers as they spin guaranteeing you the chance to win is so exciting! The chipmunk host is quite cute too.
<p> Reel Cash Critters is not your typical slots game. To play, you wager your GVs (Gamesville’s virtual currency that you win by playing games) and spin. You can win cash prizes from $5-$10, obviously a great part of the game! When the slots spin, dollar signs appear in my eyes! :)
<p> This is what the game looks like. The bright colors are eye-catching and draw you in. Who knows what that next pull of the lever will bring.
<p> What make the game unique are the mini games and critters – who doesn’t love cute woodland creatures? Within the game, you can hit the “Spin-o-Matic” which is a dial that you spin and depending on the critter that you land on, you get an extra GV bonus.
<p> Look at the chipmunk enjoying his popcorn way too much.
<p> If you are a Gold member you get another game on top of the Spin-o-Matic. “Reel Slots Shots” is a county fair-style shooting gallery where you can win GVs. Ducks, rabbits, and even our mascot Poke pop up for your chance to hit. The more you get, the more GVs you win.
<p> I started playing it just a mere few days ago, but there's no holding me back now. I start my day off by playing it each morning. I like to hit bet max in the hopes of winning more. That hasn't worked for me quite so well yet, I've lost a lot of GV's! I'm hoping to hit the big one sometime soon. :) When you do win, there are noises alerting you. The shapes that made you a winner flash so you can see which ones helped to make you a winner.
<p> Reel Cash Critters is a fun game that I recommend everyone to play. Don't blame if you get hooked though!
<p> If you all sign up using this link, http://gamesville.com/bonus/rccMomSpark, you'll receive 10,000 free GV's added to your account!

<p> It gives me great pleasure to score a great deal on a product or service. Getting a manicure and pedicure for 50% off? Oh yes! How about a brunch for four for 72% off? I'm on it! I don't mind paying full price for things at all, but it's fun to pay a reduced price for something you thought would be much more expensive. No Better Deal wants to help everyone pay as little as possible for their favorite items.
<p> No Better Deal offers high-quality surplus inventory &amp; retail returns up to 60% less than retail price. If you're looking to score a good deal, you've come to the right place. Right now, a great deal that I spotted is the Barnes and Nobles Nook offered for only $109! There are different categories (for the home, kids and baby, computers, electronics, etc) to make searching for what you want easier. The items are either in brand new condition or in an opened or resealed box. This just means that the box was opened or resealed, nothing is wrong with the item whatsoever. No Better Deal is a great place to save some $$. There's a great deal for everyone, why not find yours today?
<p> I was sent a TomTom VIA 1405 TM GPS for review purposes. I was excited to review this because I will soon be buying a car. The GPS will come in handy whenever I travel and need directions.
<p> Using TomTom maps, you have access to one million more miles of mapped road in the US than you would using any other GPS brand. With TomTom VIA's Free Lifetime Map Updates, you can download the latest map edition every few months. And, with TomTom Map Share On-Demand Updates, you can easily make instant changes in between map releases, and download verified updates from other TomTom users to your map.
<p> Outsmart delays using IQ Routes. The exclusive technology directs you to your destination using the smartest, fastest route possible. TomTom knows to avoid certain roads during rush hour, streets inundated with traffic light changes and pedestrian traffic, and more, so that you always take the fastest way to get anywhere, at any time. TomTom VIA also gives you the most accurate real-time traffic information available with Free Lifetime Traffic Updates with no advertisements. As soon as an accident or other delay is found on your route, TomTom alerts you and can re-route you to an alternative, faster route.
<p> This GPS is utterly incredible. No longer will I have to print out maps from Mapquest or Google Maps and take them in the car with me! I always get nauseous from reading in the car, and I never liked having to look at the directions to figure out where I'm going. All you have to do is simply input your current address and then the destination address that you want to go. The device is touch screen and it took me a minute to get used to using the keyboard to input the address. A clear guided voice will take you where you want to go. The voice is loud and easy to hear. I think I would have no problem hearing the GPS over other people talking or the radio playing. It blows my mind that this smart little square box has over 1 million mapped roads inputted into it! Another great reason to have a GPS is realizing that you don't know how to get somewhere, when you initially thought that you did. Just plug in the address and you'll quickly find the right way to go. This is much easier than getting stressed out and asking someone for directions that could potentially be wrong.
<p> I took the GPS out of the box and played around with it, just to see what it was like since I couldn't yet use it in a car. I had never owned a GPS previously. The 4.3" screen is very easy to read and the graphics are displayed bright and vividly. I like that this device is in color, instead of black and white. The device is thin and lightweight. It can easily be mounted on your windshield for easy access. I enjoyed viewing the different maps and seeing everything that the GPS had to offer.
<p> One of the features that I like best is that the screen displays your travel time. This lets you know how long it will take to get there, and how many miles away your destination is. That's a truly handy feature to have, to let someone accurately know when you will be arriving.
<p> I can't wait to use this GPS when I'm driving. I know that it will revolutionize my driving experience and make life much easier.

<p> Directions1. In a large bowl, beat shortening until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition (mixture will appear curdled). Beat in syrup and milk. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, ginger and allspice; add to shortening mixture and beat just until moistened. Stir in pumpkin and pineapple.
<p> 2. Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350° for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to a wire rack to cool completely.
<p> 3. For frosting, in a small bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until fluffy. Add confectioners' sugar; beat until smooth. Frost cupcakes.
<p> Fine linens are important to me. I like to sleep on comfortable linen sheets, and I even have a few linen nightgowns that I love. I've always preferred linen as my fabric of choice. It's easy, comfortable, and an ideal lightweight fabric. If you've never owned anything linen before, now is the perfect time to start!
<p> Jacaranda Living is a wholesaler and retailer of fine embroidered waffle linens for home and spa, embroidered decorative and baby pillows, nursery bedding and more. Whether you're looking for linen bed sheets, linen dinner and cocktail napkins, or even a linen duvet cover, they have your linen needs met. Most of their products are of high quality and made by talented South African women in socially responsible environments (except for some, which aren't made in South Africa.) Their products come in a range of different styles and patterns, to suit anyone's needs.
<p> If you're looking to order some fine linens for your home, Jacaranda Living is your linen headquarters.
<p> I was sent a gorgeous Dee nightgown for review purposes.
<p> A model wearing the Dee nightgown.
<p> This nightgown is wonderful. The white color is very elegant and the little blue flowers on the top are very cute. It's extremely lightweight and comfortable, it keeps me cool too. The nightgown is essential for those hot summer nights, and even into the early Fall season. It fits well, but is slightly flowy. I like that it's flowy and not extremely tight and figure hugging. Pajamas shouldn't be so tight that they are uncomfortable to wear. The linen is of high quality too. I've already washed it twice and it's held up fantastically.
<p> Anything from Jacaranda Living would make a perfect birthday or housewarming gift. Next time you're in need of a gift, keep them in mind.
