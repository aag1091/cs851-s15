<p> Nothing captures the holidays more than sparkling beverages. These delectable, tasty beverages truly represent the holiday season to me. Serve a sparkling cranberry mock tail with a slice of lime on the side for a fun non-alcoholic drink. You can even use the cranberry juice as a mixer too, if desired. With some yummy hors d'oeuvres on the side, your guests will be partying in style.
<p> I've been aware of R.W. Knudsen beverages for years and they are always quality made and truly delicious. The fact that they are produced without any unnatural additives makes it all the better for me. These drinks are best served ice cold.
<p> I was sent four bottles of delicious sparkling drinks. They all looked fantastic and I couldn't wait for the taste test. I received cranberry, apple, blueberry and pear. These drinks would be fantastic for Christmas, and they would also make a fantastic New Years Eve drink, if you don't drink alcoholic beverages.
<p> The celebratory beverages are packed in elegant champagne-style bottles, perfect for special occasions. Why not have them for a pop of color on your holiday table, or give them as a hostess gift?
<p> The apple was my absolute favorite. The pale yellow color was very nice, it almost looked like wine! The beverage was delicious and very refreshing. You could definitely taste the apple flavor, but the flavor wasn't overwhelming. The taste of the apple was very fresh. I liked that the beverage was organic, which is important to me. The juice was sweet, but not overly sugary. When you sampled the beverage, the taste of apple was prevalent, as was the carbonation. The carbonation was not over the top, but gave the beverage some much needed pizazz. The bubbles most certainly make the drink.
<p> The blueberry was also great. The color of it was a deep blueish almost purple color that was just gorgeous. The flavor of blueberry was prominent. Sometimes blueberry drinks can taste artificial, but this truly did taste like fresh blueberry juice. The carbonation level was subtle but noticeable. I loved the combination of sweet, tart blueberries with addictive fizziness. It's a pairing that you can't go wrong with.
<p> I don't like pears much, so the pear beverage was not one of my favorites. I tried it and it wasn't bad though. If you do like pears, you'll definitely love this beverage.
<p> The cranberry beverage was the last one I tried. I enjoyed this one as well. It had a gorgeous rosy color that I absolutely loved. The taste of it was sweet, but not overly sweet. I love cranberries so I knew that I would really enjoy this beverage. The level of the bubbles were perfect, not too much but just right. The drink was tart, just like how fresh cranberries were. The tart taste matched with the fizziness was right on key. It was smooth going down and left you wanting more long after your glass was emptied. This drink would be great served with a nice slice of pie or cake.
<p> I highly recommend R.W. Knudsen beverages for your Christmas holiday.

<p> I finally stepped into 2011 (well almost 2012!) by getting a smart phone. For years I had a regular, ordinary cell phone. Yes, I got teased on a consistent basis. I work in an industry where I need to be readily accessible to my phone and email. I decided to get an iPhone 4S. Of course when you get a new phone, you have to accessorize it, right?
<p> DomeSkin is specially designed to protect your device while allowing you to personalize it with your own unique custom style. DomeSkin products can be easily removed from the device and come off totally clean thanks to the patented 3M technology used in the construction.
<p> Unlike thin vinyl based skins, DomeSkin products are reusable and they provide an additional 3D layer of protection. The clear dome design not only offers a customizable stylish 3D look for your device, it also inhibits slipping and allows better gripping of the device. DomeSkin products are scratch-resistant and much more durable than other thin vinyl skin products.
<p> DomeSkin offers skins for the iPhone, iPod, iPad, and any version of the Blackberry. The designs come in a range of patterns, colors, and styles. I like that DomeSkin offers such a variety to choose from. There is definitely something for anyone. Whether you like polka dots, sports, abstract, zebra print, or flowers, they have you covered and more.
<p> I've had cases for my phone before that were impossible to get off. They practically became attached to the phone and it was really annoying. I knew that I didn't want to have that issue again.
<p> When I had the chance to review some iPhone skins, I was excited. I took my time browsing the pages. I finally settled on zebra pink and fluer de lys.
<p> These two styles instantly stuck out to me. The patterns are bright, bubbly, and fun. The colors are really vivid too. I also really like how they have a 3D look. I like my phone cases to reflect my taste. The skins were very easy to put on and I had no issues at all.
<p> The packaging has the front and back skin inside. They are not connected. First you put on the front skin, then the back one. I have the pink zebra skin on my phone right now. I really love it! The skins are sticky and adhere well to your device, not to mention that they are high quality too. The skin is thicker than most skins, but it still maintains a slim look to the phone, which is impressive. The skin does protect the phone somewhat too. I like that the skin does not obstruct the side controls of my iPhone, like some cases sometimes do. Another good feature of the product is that the skin is reusable. If you decide you want to give your phone a makeover, it's not a problem. It comes off easily and clean, leaving no residue or material behind.
<p> The skin is scratch-proof. Do you sometimes place your electronic devices down hard on a table or desk? Or do you let your phone rattle around in your purse? No worries, your phone will be protected and the case will be scratch-free.
<p> The only issue I have with this case is that the skin sometimes sticks to objects. It's not a huge downfall, it's just something to get used to. If it does stick to something, it's easy to remove.
<p> Overall, I'm really happy with these cases and my iPhone looks great in them! Anything from DomeSkin would make the perfect gift for that tech-junkie in your life.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a product of their choice from DomeSkin.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> There's nothing better than chocolate. Well pasta and carbs are good, but chocolate of course tops them. There is nothing that comes between me and my chocolate. I don't discriminate with the confectionery treat. Chocolate cake, cookies, ice cream, and pie? Brownies too you say? Yes please! I always love to try new chocolate sweet treats just to expand my chocolate horizon. :)
<p> Asher's Chocolates offers an award-winning selection of chocolates and other sweets—from assorted pralines to our chocolate-smothered pretzels and creamy fudge. They also have one of the largest (and most delicious) lines of sugar-free chocolates in the country.
<p> Their original family recipes began with Chester A. Asher. He was a Scottish farm boy from Canada, with a passion for chocolates and a knack for getting to the heart of a sugar craving. Always on the hunt for new ways to delight his customers, he was ever perfecting his creations, jotting new recipes down on bags of sugar.
<p> Today, they use the freshest, purest ingredients, just as Chester did. They also never skimp on deliciousness. Though their company has expanded over the years, they continue to treat our customers and employees like family. Asher’s Chocolates are made with love.
<p> Asher's is most certainly the gateway to chocolate heaven. I am sure the gate is made out of chocolate too. :) Your sweet tooth can be satisfied like no other with goodies from Asher's.
<p> I was sent a box of pecan caramel patties. How can you go wrong with chocolate, pecans, and caramel?
<p> These little bite-size pieces of heavenly goodness were delicious! They are the perfect size for a mid-day snack or dessert that leaves you feeling guilt-free. The chocolate was sweet and flavorful. The pecans gave the treat a nice crunch which I love in candy. The candy was also chewy, but not overly chewy. The caramel was sweet, gooey, and just utterly perfect. You could taste each individual ingredient, but everything came together and combined perfectly for a perfect balance. The candy was very fresh and had a quality taste. I really had to control myself not to do overdo it! It's easy to trick yourself into thinking it's okay to have more than one because they are small, but it's easy to fall into the chocolate trap! These would go great with a glass of white wine, or a nice icy cold glass of milk.
<p> Anything from Asher's would make a perfect hostess gift, birthday present, or a just thinking of you present. Hopefully the recipient will share. :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a box of Asher's Chocolates Pecan Caramel Patties.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> I'm always looking for new ways to get fit and be healthy. I've been known to succomb to the newest hottest workout routine and exercise classes pretty easily. With New Year's right around the corner, what better way than to ring in the new year with a hot new body?
<p> Hot Pants are specially designed sports shorts made with a comfortable material that includes bio-ceramic technology. Bio-ceramics emit far-infrared rays (heat waves) and reflect back the heat naturally generated by the body to promote deeper warming of tissue and breakdown of fat cells. This results in much higher levels of perspiration leading to the flushing out of toxins and edemas that contribute to the appearance of cellulite. This enhanced body heating also promotes better circulation and lymphatic drainage, the core principle of non-surgical cellulite spa treatments.
<p> Hot Pants are taking the UK by storm and are very popular in Britian. I was excited to be a part of a select group of American bloggers who got to try them out. What a cool opportunity!
<p> The shorts can be worn under any clothing and during any activity. Whether you're walking, exercising, doing housework, and more. They can be worn outside and on their own too. It's been proven that you can lose 2 pants sizes in 2 weeks! The great thing about Hot Pants is that they help you to lose weight and feel great. :)
<p> The shorts are black and tight fitting, which is a good thing. I like my workout clothes to fit well, not be loose fitting. They are very comfortable and almost mold to your body. They are easy to put on I was able to bend and move well in them. I wore them at home as exercise shorts when I did a pilates work-out DVD. I instantly noticed how much they made me sweat when I was exercising. I don't normally sweat much when I exercise, so I knew these were working.
<p> I've been wearing them every time I work-out and I feel awesome afterwards. One thing I really love is that I'm sweating out all the toxins in my body, which is healthy in and of itself. I've already lost 3 lbs with them too and my stomach feels smaller! The shorts seem very durable and I think will last a while. I know that if I continue wearing them, I will really start to notice results. I can't wait to see how I look in the coming weeks, especially since holiday treats are about to be in abundance.
<p> I really think these shorts are a great weight-loss and health aide. They would be perfect for anyone looking to get in better shape or lose weight.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thanks to HotPants for providing me with these complimentary shorts in exchange for the review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Sweets definitely hold the key to my heart. There's nothing like a warm, fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookie, or a fudgy brownie. If you serve both with a tall glass of milk, now you're really talking! Sweet treats bring people together and are definitely best served with warm conversation and hearty laughs.
<p> The Cake Chef's Cookie Jar is a fantastic bakery based in Staten Island, NY. The bakery offers more than 150 confectionery treats baked from scratch on the premises. Whatever your sweet tooth could possibly be craving is readily available for you. Are you in the mood for a black and white cookie or an espresso bar? Maybe a peanut butter cream, cheesecake brownie bite, or apple turnover would be more your style? The list of cookies and treats are endless and the bakery does a fantastic job in satisfying their customers. They even have some unique treats like cinnamon pecan balls, Mexican tea cookies, and human dog biscuits! Of course you have to wash it all down with a steaming cup of coffee, a frozen cappuchino, and most definitely a chai tea as well. Are you craving a sweet drink? No problem! Try a french soda, red velvet cake, shake, or a frozen hot chocolate.
<p> I was generously sent a large pound of assorted cookies and treats. When I opened the box and saw the chocolate goodness staring back at me, I knew it was time to dig in! The bakery knew my love for chocolate as they sent a lot of chocolate yummies. Don't you wish you could have one right now?
<p> The first treat that I indulged in was the mint chocolate brownie bite. I love anything mint in chocolate, it's a fantastic combination. I took a bite and it was truly everything I had hoped for! The outside of the small brownie bite was a deep brown espresso color. Once you bit into the heavenly square, you were met with a minty rush of flavor. The mint was cool and refreshing and just perfect. It was also a beautiful sea foam green color. The chocolate was sweet and rich and just simply perfect. The combination of the mint and the chocolate together was awesome. This is a great sweet treat that would make for a great after-dinner dessert, or a pick-me-up during the day too. It would go great with a relaxing glass of wine, flavorful cup of coffee, or icy cold glass of milk too.
<p> I sampled the chocolate linzer tart soon after that. This treat featured two chocolate cookies sandwiched between a layer of chocolate creme. Can you get any more delicious than that? I think not! This is definitely a great treat for any chocoholic. The cookies were soft, flakey and buttery. They had a great chocolate flavor that I just couldn't get enough of! The layer of chocolate creme was spread on perfectly. It wasn't too thick, but just right. The creme was sweet and bursting with fabulous chocolate flavor. The entire cookie was melt in your mouth delicious and I highly recommend it. As soon as it was gone, I was hoping another one would magically appear in the box. ;)
<p> I hope to soon sample the rest of the goodies in the box. The Cake Chef's Cookie Jar ships nationwide. They would be a fantastic addition to your next party or gathering. The cookies make a great hostess gift, birthday present, or a just thinking of you present. You also don't need a specific occasion to enjoy the cookies either. Any time or day is always perfect for cookie time!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a pound of assorted cookies from the Cake Chef's Cookie Jar bakery.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> I use my iPad on a daily basis, and if I travel I take it with me as well. It's convenient and I love how everything I need is in that tiny little tablet! Even though the touch screen is modern and fun, sometimes I end up selecting something or opening a window I didn't want to which isn't so fun. You have to be very precise with where you touch, which isn't always so easy. That's where BoxWave comes in to save the day!
<p> BoxWave is your technological paradise. They have accessories and products for iPad 1 and 2, blackberries, kindles, droids, and practically any high-tech device or smart phone. Anything from this site would be a fantastic Christmas present for that resident tech junkie in your family.
<p> I browsed the site and came upon the iPad stylus. This handy little pen-wannabe would make my life easier when using my iPad, and the thought of that was fantastic. No longer would I have to deal with hitting a key that I didn't want or accidently sending an email when I wasn't finished.
<p> I was sent the Capacitive Stylus for review. It comes in 5 different colors, although I was sent the black. It is a versatile stylus that works with iphones, ipads, smartphones, and tablets.The stylus is really easy to use, not to mention it's sleek and modern looking. It's comfortable to hold and feels just like you're holding a pen. I used it earlier to send an email. At the end of the email not once did I have to correct a spelling mistake! Usually when I type by hand on the iPad I have quite a few mistakes to correct. Wherever you tap using the stylus is what is going to be selected. There are no mistakes or surprises, you get a direct hit of what you tap on! The tip of the stylus is large and very responsive.
<p> A convenient thing the stylus offers is the fact that you can clip the stylus to your device, your shirt, or even the case. That way it will always be within reach. I think I will keep mine inside of my iPad case since there is a handy compartment in it. What I like most about using the stylus is that you can eliminate further and future smudges, dirt, and fingerprints when using it. That's definitely a plus in my book! That's what I hate the most about touch screen electronics.
<p> The stylus is perfect for people who use tablets or iPads for graphic design. Your work will be flawless instead of full of flaws when you use the stylus. You can freely and easily draw with it.
<p> If you commute on a train or bus you don't even have to take your gloves off to use your iPad or device. Keep your hands warm while getting that work done! The stylus is easy to use when wearing gloves or mittens.
<p> This would make the perfect gift for anyone who uses a tablet or any electronic device with a touch-screen. It will save them a lot of aggrivation and annoyance too! I know that I won't be using my iPad without it now.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to BoxWave for providing with me this complimentary stylus in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Having a clean house is very important to me. I take great pride in making sure my house looks its best at all times. Sometimes you miss cleaning in the little nooks and crannies though. It's always really nice to have someone with a fresh eye find the spots you missed.
<p> Great Green Cleaning is a cleaning service that cleans residential homes and offices. They also specialize in post construction cleaning, clutter clean-outs, bed bug cleaning, and more. The best part is that all of their cleaning supplies are eco-friendly and green! The service is offered for all 5 boros in NYC and Hoboken, NJ too. They have 30 years of environmentally friendly non-toxic hypoallergenic, green house cleaning experience. They specialize in cleaning, organization, laundry, cooking, and will even do your errands for you!
<p> When I had the chance to review their cleaning service, I immediately jumped at the chance. I was very excited because I knew that a cleaning service could clean my home a lot better than I could. Plus it's nice to get a break from cleaning every once in a while.
<p> Maria came to my house this morning and cleaned for 5 hours. She was friendly and extremely professional. She immediately got to work. I wasn't there throughout the whole cleaning, but when I was there I snuck a few peeks at her work and I was more than impressed. I saw her cleaning the knobs on my stove! That's something that I would have never even thought to do. She took all of the vases and knick-knacks I had on my windowsill in my kitchen and washed them, something else I would have never thought to do.
<p> Maria's care, dedication, and high attention to detail was definitely recognizable in her work. She cleaned my shower and made the shower floor look whiter than snow. My faucet shined and looked brand new. She dusted everything meticulously and there was not a speck of dirt or grime left on any surface. She washed and swept my floors and got into any corner better than I could ever do. I never even saw her take a break once!
<p> I can't get over what a fabulous job Maria did and I am thoroughly pleased and impressed with her, and the company. She even took the time to organize my pots and pans in my kitchen! I liked that the cleaners the company uses are earth friendly, and they made my apartment smell great too!
<p> Here are some pictures that show what a fantastic job was done:
<p> I highly recommend Maria and Great Green Cleaning for any of your future cleaning needs. You can have your home or office cleaned 7 days a week. If you're having a Christmas or New Years Eve party this year, a great way to get ready for the party would be to book an appointment at Great Green Cleaning.

<p> Foot pain is a serious issue. Not only is it painful, but it can cause permanent damage to your feet. It can be almost excruciating if you work a job where you're on your feet for many hours a day too. You should make sure that you're taking care of your feet as best as possible by wearing comfortable shoes and inserts if necessary.
<p> Kendall Gelthotics were developed by Michael Kendall, a Biomechanical Engineer specializing in orthotic design. The Kendall GelThotic offers support for issues of plantar fasciitis, neuromas, problems of the forefoot, and general heel pain.
<p> When I wear boots with a heel or high heels for a long period of time my feet really hurt. I think it's because I rarely wear them, I prefer flat shoes. I've had my fair share of foot pain from walking long distances, or just being on my feet for long periods of time. Not only are these gelthotics great for reducing foot pain, but they reduce lower back and knee pain too!
<p> The essence of support:
<p> Walk away from the pain of plantar fasciitis, adding comfort, support and relief no matter what you are doing.
<p> The unique cobra-shaped design fits under the existing insole and into the limited space of the shoe without changing the fit.
<p> This minimal design in combination with revolutionary, SupportXGel ensures the greatest degree of support available without a prescription.
<p> I was sent a pair of gelthotics for review. I was excited to be able to review them, because I was hoping it would give me the chance to wear heels again with much less agony. The gelthotic was very easy to put into my shoe and I had no problems with them. They securely stick to the the inside of your shoe. The gelthotics has a curved shape which easily fits into the bed of any shoe. I put them to the test last night when I had to wear heels to an event. I knew I was going to be on my feet for a while and I carried flats in my bag just in case. Once you walk with the gelthotics in your shoes you definitely notice them. It's not uncomfortable at all but you do realize there's something in your shoe. It has a gel-like feel which provides great support to your foot and arch. The gelthotics did not come loose or slip when I walked either.
<p> I was able to wear the heels all night with no problem! At the end of the night when my feet should have been screaming in pain, there was a very minimal amount of pain. I was very impressed and now I can bring new life into my shoes that I rarely wore because of foot pain. These gelthotics would make a perfect gift for anyone who has foot pain or who is on their feet for their job a lot. They will thank you for making their life more comfortable!

<p> I don't post about myself very often, so I wanted to give you a glimpse into my life.
<p> 1. I'm from the south. I lived in North Carolina until 2005. I've lived in New York City since 2006.
<p> 2. I'm an only child.
<p> 3. I'm very anal about my clothes and prefer everything to look its best 100% of the time. I hate stains and wrinkles.
<p> 4. I'm not exceptionally good at cooking but I really love it. I'm a big fan of baking and have a large sweet tooth. I also watch the Food Network endlessly.
<p> 5. I don't have a dishwasher in my apartment. It's one thing I complain about everytime I have to wash dishes by hand.
<p> 6. I hope to one day be able to travel to Europe. England, France, Italy, and Australia are all on my list.
<p> 7. I'm a very loyal friend and am always there when someone needs me.
<p> 8. I love 80's music and TV shows.
<p> 9. Some of my all time favorite movies are Riding in Cars with Boys, Practical Magic, Big, Almost Famous, and Walk the Line.
<p> 10. I'm obsessed with Craigslist. Every single job I've ever had, I've gotten off of Craigslist. Half of my apartment is furnished with Craigslist furniture too. I can always find a good deal on there.
<p> 11. Apples are my favorite fruit.
<p> 12. I'm a choco-holic.
<p> 13. I'm a nightowl.
<p> 14. I love to laugh and am usually very silly. Some of my favorite comedians are Chelsea Handler and Kathy Griffin. I also love Denis Leary and Dane Cook too.
<p> 15. My dog Colby, who lives with my parents is 13. We've had her since she was a year old.
<p> 16. I've never been to the West Coast.
<p> 17. I've been entering sweepstakes since 2004. Once I started this blog it became hard to do both. My biggest prize to date is a 2007 Volvo XC-90 SUV that I won in July, 2006 through a McDonald's Pirates of the Caribbean contest. We sold it for college tuition.
<p> 18. I absolutely LOVE to blog. This is the only thing that I've done everyday for practically two years. I usually can't stick to doing something everyday but this really has made a huge impact on my life.
<p> 19. I've made a career out of social media both in my professional and personal life. Thank you Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter founders (sorry I don't know who you are!) Should I thank the Twitter bird too?

<p> When I get migraines, they are completely awful. I basically have to shut myself in a dark room with no light or sound and hope they go away relatively quickly. Migraines are awful and I don't wish them on anyone. I can have a migraine last anywhere from an hour to 5 hours. It's not fun at all, especially when you're at work or out. I make sure to always take Excedrin as it rapidly decreases the timeframe of my migraine. Some migraines that I get are better than others, but generally they are terrible.
<p> Excedrin is an over-the-counter headache pain reliever, typically in the form of tablets or caplets. It contains acetaminophen (paracetamol), aspirin, and caffeine. It is heavenly headache relief in the form of a small tablet. Excedrin is the first non-prescription medicine approved by the FDA to treat all the symptoms of a migraine. I rely on Excedrin for relief and it's the only medicine I will take for a migraine.
<p> Nearly 30 million Americans deal with migraines on a regular basis and they are three times more common in women than men. How do you deal with migraines? Have you suffered with them for years or do you get them every now on then? How do you find relief if you're at work or not at home? What are your quick-relief tips? Do certain scents or smells trigger migraines for you? Or maybe you try to activate trigger or pressure points to decrease the pain. I'd love to hear how you all deal with them.
<p> I find that taking Excedrin at the first inkling of a migraine helps it to go away quicker than waiting to take the medicine while it has already started.
<p> Did you know:More than three-quarters (87%) of working Americans would give up something for an entire year to never have to go through the pain of a migraine ever again.
<p> Eight in ten (83%) migraine sufferers confess that when they have a migraine, their family suffers as much as they do because of the impact it has on their ability to go about their regular routine.
<p> Migraine Tips and Prevention Techniques
<p> There are many different ways to manage migraines. There is no simple solution and every treatment plan should be individualized.
<p> Perhaps the most important tool in tracking migraines is a migraine diary. It is used by doctors to track potential triggers and patterns related to your migraine. It helps you track food you eat when migraines occur, duration of migraines, type of pain, amount of sleep, etc.
<p> Aerobic exercise has been shown to make an appreciable difference in reducing migraines and promoting a general sense of well-being. Even if you walk only 15 to 20minutes.
<p> Drinking plenty of water will help you keep hydrated and can help prevent the frequency of migraine incidents.
<p> And, when migraine pain does set in, consider finding a quiet place to rest, applying a cool compress to the back of your neck.
<p> Talk with your doctor about an over-the-counter pain reliever like Excedrin® Migraine, which starts to relieve migraine pain in 30 minutes.
<p> For more tips and insights, please visit www.execedrin.com/migraine.
<p> Excedrin® Migraine and the National Headache Foundation teamed up to conduct a survey* that brings to light just how much people with migraines suffer – and how eager they are to lessen the pain and reduce the disruption in their lives. And what’s even more remarkable are the trade-offs people would make if they didn’t have to endure the pain of a migraine.
<p> For example, did you know that:
<p> The average migraine lasts for 12 hours for those who don’t take any medication
<p> Nearly two-thirds (61%) of adult migraine sufferers would willingly wait in a long line rather than suffer from migraine pain
<p> A third (33%) would give up five percent of their annual salary
<p> Other workers would toss their vacation days (26%) or weekends (17%)
<p> And more than half (52%) would rather visit in-laws
<p> Excedrin would like to relieve your headache with a fabulous gift basket!
