<p> SeaPak is heaven for seafood lovers. As you browse the golden doors in the supermarket holding in SeaPak's delicious foods, you find yourself in a dilemma. Should I buy the jumbo breaded shrimp, the popcorn fish, or the shrimp scampi? No, I should try the tilapia tenders! As you can see, SeaPak is home to many different seafood meals that will make their way from your tastebuds, to your stomach, and into your heart where you will love them.
<p> The SeaPak Shrimp Company is the #1 retail brand within the frozen specialty seafood category. For 60 years, they've provided the highest quality, best-tasting shrimp. Quite simply, they're the shrimp experts. The SeaPak Shrimp Co. is known for its care and attention in choosing only the best shrimp for its retail and foodservice products.
<p> If you're a shrimp lover, you must try SeaPak's shrimp. I'm speaking from experience and it's delicious!
<p> I was sent a bag of popcorn fish for review. There are about 55 pieces in each bag and they are whole cut fillets lightly breaded with SeaPak’s signature seasoning. The bite sized treats are perfect to be stuffed into a taco, topped on a salad or dipped as an appetizer. They are equally great on their own too!
<p> My boyfriend created a taco with these bite-sized pieces which fit perfectly inside. Taco de fish was stuffed with the popcorn fish, lettuce, tomato, a tiny bit of sour cream, and cheese. Sounds good, right? He said the popcorn fish had a great flavor from the seasoning and the crunch was fantastic. The fish was juicy and flavorful when you bit into the popcorn fish, but the outside was perfectly crunchy. Just perfect! It really went well with all of the other ingredients he put in the taco. He said he never had popcorn fish before, but only popcorn shrimp, so it was interesting to try a new version of an old favorite. The possibilities for these bite-sized nuggets of deliciousness are endless. Be creative and incorporate them into your favorite dish today.

<p> I lost one more lb this week on Nutrisystem, for a total loss of 6 lbs! I am in a new range of numbers now and that really excites me! I am noticing a slight change in the way my clothes fit and I feel a lot better about myself. I also notice a change in the way my face looks too, it definitely looks thinner.
<p> I have been following the plan to a T, exercising, and drinking the required amount of water. I love that I can eat delicious foods that make me lose weight. It's really a treat. I even bought some new clothes last night, and for the first time in a long time I actually truly liked the way they looked on me.
<p> My goal for next week is 1.5 or 2 lbs down. Hope to update you with good news next week!
<p> *Nutrisystem is providing their program free of charge for my participation in the Nutrisystem Nation Blogging Program.

<p> My feet often get cold, it's the worst part about the cold months of the year. Either my feet or freezing cold, or they get hot instantly when I put on socks. I can't win! When I do want to slip something on my feet, I often go for a cozy pair of slippers though that are easy to take off when my feet get hot. Who doesn't love a cute pair of slippers to keep their feet warm?
<p> Bunny Slippers is your source for all things bunny and bunny-slipper related! In addition to their selection of bunny slippers, they offer a growing variety of animal slippers, novelty slippers, stuffed animals, socks and other unique gifts. They're always adding new products to their site, so check back often!
<p> Bunny Slippers? Check! Black bear paw slippers? Yup! Green turtle slippers or Ladybug slippers? Yes! They have those too. This company offers virtually every animal slipper-fied that you could ever possibly want to see featured.
<p> I was sent a pair of dalmatian slippers!
<p> These slippers are so funny. They are very realistic and have the perfect attributes of a dalmatian dog! The slippers fit me well and are very soft and comfortable. The fur of the dog is very soft too. I love walking around my house with these when I'm just lounging around. I like that they have an open back and slip on and off easily whenever I don't want to wear them, instead of having to deal with taking socks on and off. The only thing I don't like is that the inside is white, because they will get dirty easily. These will be great to wear until there's more spring like weather in New York!
<p> Are you a fan of soda, but are tired of lugging 6 or 12 packs of soda into your car, or even worse heavy bottles? Do you wish you could have soda all the time without all of the annoying bottles and cans to deal with and recycle? Do you want to save money on buying soda too? Well, Soda Stream is your answer!
<p> Soda Stream is so easy to use. Making carbonated water and soft drinks is simple! Turn tap water into sparkling water in under 30 seconds, with no clean-up. Enjoy the freshness and convenience of homemade soda and protect the environment at the same time. No heavy bottles to carry, store at home or throw away. Fizz to your taste and add the flavor of your choice to make your favorite drink. Simple to clean and reuse. With a variety of colors and silhouettes, you'll be sure to find a soda maker to match with any decor.
<p> Imagine having soda at your convenience whenever you want it! Whether you like lemon lime soda, cream soda, cola, or rootbeer, Soda Stream provides it! They have many more flavors as well.

<p> If you're looking for chocolate nirvana, you can make sure to turn to Sarris to assist you. Whether you're looking for springtime chocolate covered oreos, gift boxes of treats, or even designing your own box of chocolate, Sarris is your go to company.
<p> I was sent a box of chocolate covered pretzel slims: (a close up of the delicious treats.)
<p> The best part about these goodies? 100 small calories!! I couldn't believe that the pack was only so few calories because so many chocolate covered pretzels are in there. Having a pack of these will definitely curb that sweet tooth of yours. After I finished one pack it filled me up and I didn't want anymore. Instead of having a candy bar or a piece of cake with hundreds of calories, have a pack of these. They taste just as great but have half the calories.
<p> Chocolate and pretzels to me is a timeless combination. How can you not love sweet and salty? These pretzels would be a great snack to throw in a lunchbox for school or work, or just to have a little sweet treat during the day. I thought these treats were delicious. I had a pack for a snack. The pretzels were very fresh and provided a great crunch with just a hint of saltiness. The chocolate was rich and sweet and utterly fantastic. The chocolate blanketed the pretzel in a most fabulous way and gave it such personality. I guarantee that you will be in chocolate bliss after sampling these!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 6 pack of Sarris chocolate covered pretzel slims.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!2. Please tell me why you love chocolate and pretzels! (1 entry)

<p> If you often find yourself stressed, tired, and just generally unable to relax, you're definitely not alone. Massages feel great and often help but the tension and stress that you're feeling can easily come back. Acupuncture can be costly, just like massages and is painful. What else can you do that you haven't already tried? I have just the answer for you.
<p> Yantra Mat is an acupressure mat that provides stress relief. This unique mat utilizes 100% ABS plastic disks patterned on the mat that are rather intimidating looking at first but are actually the secret behind how the Yantra Mat works. The hundreds of disks provide a flower pattern that allows the mat to utilize over 8,820 pressure points."
<p> I had seen other bloggers review this mat and I thought that it looked like something I was interested in trying. The mat comes in the colors of purple, green and black.
<p> I received the mat and it came in a convenient zip-up case for easy storage. When you're not using the mat, just put it in the case and store it underneath your bed or in a closet.
<p> A close up of the spikes:
<p> A guide to using the Yantra mat:Carefully lie down on your Yantra Mat. Distribute your weight evenly over the contact points. For the first few minutes, you will likely experience discomfort; this will subside. Breathe deeply and remain still.
<p> Certain conditions can make our skin more sensitive. The Yantra Mat should not feel painful. If it does hurt, place a thin sheet between your body and the mat. After a period of time, try using the Yantra Mat without a protective layer.
<p> Days 1-4We recommend about 10 minutes of use. You'll recognize the Yantra Mat’s effects right away, but they may develop once you start using the mat more frequently. Some people fall asleep on the mat. Others get an energy boost immediately after use.
<p> Days 5-14We recommend about 20 minutes of use, preferably at bedtime. If you fall asleep, that’s okay. Avoid watching the clock (set an alarm if you must). The most important thing is to relax. It doesn’t matter if your total time on the mat is more than 20 minutes. Remove the mat when you wake up and go back to sleep. Eventually, you’ll feel that you awake more refreshed and energized for the day ahead.
<p> After 14 daysBy this time, you will have learned a lot about the Yantra Mat and its effects on your body/mind. Try 20-40 minutes, or more. You can lie on the mat as long as you like. We suggest using the mat daily, although some people use it less often.
<p> I tried the mat for the first time last night. I laid on it and at first it was slightly paintful but tolerable. After 3-5 minutes, the pain subsided and a wave of relaxation and minimal pain washed over me. I laid on the mat for an additional 5 minutes and I felt very relaxed and drowsy. I think this would be a great routine to adopt nightly before bed to help aid sleep. I want to try to build up my resistance to be able to eventually lay on the mat for 30-40 minutes.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Yantra mat of their color choice.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!2. Please tell me how you de-stress. (1 entry)

<p> World Water Day kicked off yesterday. It's important that we understand what is in tap water, and how it could be dangerous for us to drink unfiltered water. Some helpful tips about PUR water filtration are below.
<p> In many cities our tap water might not be as clean as we think. By-products from chlorine can sometimes show up in our tap water, in addition to agricultural pollutants, heavy metals, sediment, pharmaceuticals, and microbial cysts- YUCK!
<p> Ø Pur Water offers an at-home water filtration system to fit every lifestyle. From a one-click faucet mount to a pitcher and dispenser to even a refrigerator filter!
<p> Ø PUR faucet mount filters remove 99.9% of trace pharmaceuticals, 99% of lead and even reduce chlorine (taste and odor).
<p> Ø PUR is helping many people break their bottled water habit – by using a PUR faucet mount filter together with a refillable bottle (SIGG), each household can help eliminate up to 3,200 plastic water bottles from the world every single year. You can also save up to $800!
<p> Ø PUR water filtration systems offer reduction at a reasonable cost – certified to reduce 61 contaminants at only $0.01 for an 8-oz glass.
<p> Additional refrigerator filter info that might be interesting to you:
<p> By using two water filters per year, a refrigerator system can filter the equivalent of 3,000 bottles of water, saving over $600 a year versus purchasing a leading brand of bottled water. Making the switch to filtered water and a reusable water container can help reduce plastic bottle waste in landfills.
<p> Manufacturers recommend changing the refrigerator water filter every six months to drink with the confidence that their water is clean and fresh, and that unseen contaminants such as lead and mercury which can be found in some – but not all – tap water, have been reduced.
<p> Many refrigerators have an easy-access system, located conveniently at the bottom in the grille or just inside the refrigerator on the ceiling in the back, to make changing the filter quick and easy.
<p> What better way to honor the importance of water and at-home filtration, than by offering one lucky reader a product to help celebrate this annual day EVERY DAY in their homes with Whirlpool's PUR refrigerator filter!With the PUR Push Button Refrigerator Water Filter, you’ll get up to 100 gallons of great-tasting, clean water, per filter. That’s 6 months of clean water right from your faucet—filtered to remove 99% of lead and microbial cysts (cryptosporidium and giardia),* and reduces many other contaminants like 97% of trace levels of pharmaceuticals.**
<p> This filter fits all refrigerators with Push Button In-Grille water filter and may be used with FAST FILL water dispensing systems.***

<p> I've used Bare Minerals and Bare Escentuals makeup in the past, but have never had the opportunity to try out their skincare line. I knew it had to be great because I've had such wonderful success with their makeup.
<p> It all began when we asked women to imagine a makeup that would actually change the way they feel about their skin and themselves. We encouraged women to take a leap and try something so unique, so unlike anything they’ve experienced before. We started the idea that makeup could actually be considered skincare, and we got people talking. A makeup that could be good for you? The Bare Escentuals community was born. We became friends with our customers, forging deep, personal connections simply by listening and sharing stories.
<p> It became less about makeup and more about what really matters.
<p> Bare Minerals offers makeup and products that helps you look and feel your best, and offers flawless coverage. Skincare products are available to help your skin look healthy and beautiful-and at its best.
<p> I was sent two cosmetic products to review. I received Bare Minerals Purely Nourishing Moisturizer, and Bare Minerals Deep Cleansing Foam. I love the packaging of the boxes, the graffiti-esque writing on the side is definitely eye-catching. The size of the products are great and will last me awhile. This universal moisturizer effectively hydrates skin while improving firmness, elasticity, radiance and overall skin texture. Powered by our RareMinerals ActiveSoil Complex with its unique electrolyte delivery system, it’s formulated to perfectly moisturize combination skin. It also includes a powerful blend of antioxidants that help protect against environmental stressors.
<p> This luxuriously rich cleanser deep cleans pores and lifts away impurities. Powered by our RareMinerals ActiveSoil Complex, this non-drying formula bursts into a rich lather when activated with water to clean and instantly refresh skin for a soft, smooth complexion. Sulfate free.
<p> I used the deep cleansing foam to wash off my makeup when I got home from work this evening. The instructions say to use a very small amount, because a little goes a long way. The foam did not lather up too much (which doesn't mean that it's not working!) but enough where I felt that my skin was getting cleaned. The foam rinsed away cleanly with no problems. Afterwards my skin felt smooth and refreshed and truly clean. I've used cleansers before where my face still felt like it had makeup on it after I washed it, and I felt like I had to wash it again. I didn't feel that way with this cleanser. It didn't have any special scent to it (although I wish it did), but had a "clean" smell to it.
<p> I followed up by using the nourishing moisturizer after the cleanser. I frequently have dry/very dry skin and I find myself constantly searching for that product to keep my skin hydrated at all times. I applied a thin layer of moisturizer to my face and rubbed it in. It was not very greasy or thick which I was happy about. This product also had no strong scent. My skin instantly felt revived and rejuvenated. My skin had a nice healthy look to it afterwards.
<p> I really love these products and I will definitely be adding them into my daily beauty routine!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking FOUR (4) winners total for this contest. Two winners will win Bare Minerals Purely Nourishing Moisturizer, and two winners will win Bare Minerals Deep Cleansing Foam.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!2.

<p> Life is meant to be lived to the fullest, but sometimes we forget that when everything else gets in the way. If you want to get out to enjoy the sunshine, then you need to make sure that all your other ducks are in line. When you have all the necessities taken care of, you are much more likely to enjoy yourself when you are doing other things. Here are some tips and tricks on how to get the most out of your everyday life—getting things done and making memories.
<p> • Get a day planner – The vast majority of people now organize everything on their phones or other portable devices, though some still have paper day planners as well. Either method is fine, just make sure it works for you. There are advantages to both modes of organization, since a paper planner won’t glitch on you or lose your data, but an electronic planner can send you reminders and make sure you have no scheduling conflicts.• Keep a journal – A journal helps you remember special memories, but it also helps you keep track of important dates and milestones as well. If you have a hard time remembering fun date activities, you can keep a running list in the back. Or, a journal is useful if you want to store letters, cards, photos and other mementos tied to a specific date or memory.• Take photographs–This is true especially if you have children because they grow and change so much over such a short period of time. Whether you take a picture a day to chronicle your life’s events, or you only take a camera to special events, make sure you always keep it charged for those moments that are both unexpected and completely amazing. • Block out time – If you find you are always stressed or busy, block out at least a half hour of time each day that is solely for you. Use this time to do something you love, like reading, talking with friends or doing a hobby. If we aren’t careful, life will take over and we won’t have anything to show for it. Take the time to get organized and make memories, you’ll appreciate it down the line.

<p> Instead of having french fries, or mashed potatoes, why don't you try a different potato recipe? Expand your palate and sample a new food today.
<p> It all started in 1994 when successful New Jersey cardiac surgeon Dr. Peter Praeger and his medical partner, Dr. Eric Somberg, helped keep a family business alive. They bought Ungar’s Gefilte Fish – a popular food company within the Jewish and Yiddish communities. The doctors set out on a simple mission – to help people see nutritious food in a new light. They expanded the company to include all-natural and sensible products that would appeal to a wider consumer base. They kept the Ungar’s brand, which includes the original gefilte fish and other traditional Jewish foods, and developed Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods, which now includes dozens of all-natural, kosher frozen foods.
<p> Dr. Praeger's philosophy is that good-for-you food should actually taste good, especially if you don’t let artificial ingredients, colors and fillers get in the way. That’s why our products are made with ingredients you recognize, including flash-frozen vegetables and fish from cold Northern waters. Our hearty California Veggie Burger doesn’t conceal its tasty spinach, broccoli, peas, carrots and onions –it puts them right where you can see and taste them! And our gluten-free options are an easy way to keep wheat out of your diet, while keeping the good things in, like fiber and taste bud-pleasing flavor.
<p> I received a coupon to try any Dr. Praeger's foods I wanted. I let my boyfriend pick out what he wanted. He chose the potato pancakes.
<p> Potato pancakes are shallow-fried pancakes of grated potato, flour and egg, often flavored with grated onion or garlic and seasoning. Potato pancakes may be topped with a variety of condiments, ranging from the savory (such as sour cream) to the sweet (such as apple sauce or sugar), or they may be served ungarnished. Potato pancakes are sometimes made from mashed potatoes to produce pancake-shaped croquettes.
<p> He had them for dinner tonight. He said they had a nice crunch on the outside, but not too crunchy. The potato interior was fluffy and very soft. The potato flavor was prominent and very excellent. The size of each pancake is perfect for a quick lunch or snack. He paired it with mustard, but said it would be great paired with any condiment. He said these pancakes have a very similiar taste to the homemade potato pancakes he's had before. He liked that these weren't very greasy or oily though.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking FIVE (5) winners who will win two free product coupons for Dr. Praeger's foods each. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!2. Please tell me why you would love to win these coupons. (1 entry)

<p> Are you planning on going to Melbourne, Australia anytime soon? Or do you know anyone who lives there that would enjoy a hot air balloon ride? How incredible would it be to travel over the city of Melbourne? Check out a great experience here!
<p> Equally thrilling and relaxing, a hot-air ballooning adventure is a romantic and unforgettable experience – especially over the beautiful city of Melbourne. Depending on the wind direction you may make a tranquil hot-air balloon flight over the CBD and the Yarra River, or over the inner suburbs, parks and gardens. The still morning air makes flying conditions perfect during what is known in the hot-air ballooning industry as the "weather window", a gloriously peaceful time over an often hectic city.
<p> The hot-air ballooning journey begins with a briefing by the pilot before you head to the launch site and, if you like, help prepare the hot-air balloon for flight. Thirty minutes later you'll be drifting gracefully over the countryside. The hot-air ballooning flight itself will last around one hour. It costs $375.
<p> After gently touching down again a hot air ballooning flight certificate is distributed to all passengers, rounding off a fabulous adventure. The icing on the cake is a sumptuous Champagne breakfast at the Sofitel Hotel - the perfect way to toast your hot-air ballooning adventure. The Sofitel Hotel is also the meeting point for the adventure, although pick-ups are available at all major hotels/motels within the CBD.
<p> Beautiful jewelry is something I can't get enough of. Although I do wear a lot of costume jewelry, I can definitely appreciate a sterling silver necklace or a gold ring. There's something special about a simple piece of jewelry that catches my eye though.
<p> David Tishbi handcrafted designs specializes in a “two-tone” jewelry process, emphasizing a striking juxtaposition of gold and sterling silver. Unique designs in conventional solids are also staples throughout the expansive collection. These vibrant pieces brandish a variety of genuine and simulated stones including: amethyst, topaz, garnet, diamond, pearl, moonstone, quartz, tourmaline, and more. Each piece stands alone in its distinct motif, craftsmanship, and allure.
<p> David Tishbi Handcrafted Jewelry is carried in retail establishments worldwide and maintains its ongoing commitment to the industry setting standards that made David Tishbi more than just a name, but an ideal.
<p> David's jewelry is stunning. Each piece is so clean and pure, but at the same time speaks loudly. Whether you are in the market for a unique necklace, a wedding ring, a bracelet, a ring, a pin, or much more; David Tishbi designs is your go to company.
<p> I was sent a handcrafted Sterling Silver "believe" engraved ring.
<p> Engraved with the words "believe" is a spinning band of sterling silver creating a calming yet symbolic representation of infinity. The high polish finish has a unique chic that makes this pendant an excellent gift idea. Handcrafted in Israel this item is made from recycled precious metal that is lead and nickel free.
<p> This ring is beautiful! The spinning design of the ring is very unique, and I've never seen any jewelry like that before. The smaller ring freely spins around a bigger fixed "ring base". The ring fits well and is comfortable to slip on and off. The silver shines nicely and is of high quality. The engraved words are on strong and are very readable, I think the ring is inspirational too. If you're having a bad day, just believe in yourself and you can get through whatever hardship you're dealing with. The ring and engravement are smaller in person than in the picture, and it's a delicate piece of jewelry.The ring would be a great gift for anyone and they would certainly love it.

<p> Sadly this week I have not lost any weight on Nutrisystem but maintained. I was very busy this past week and didn't put in enough time for exercise. I did get in a new shipment of food, so that will put me back on track. I was waiting for the shipment to arrive and I was eating a lot of salad and fresh fruits and veggies while out of the NS food.
<p> I have been drinking my 6-8 glasses of water a day (which was initially on my list of things to work on) so I am happy to say I am fulfilling that part of the diet.
<p> This week I want to get in a lot of exercising in and make sure to get a few pounds off. I have a nice assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables in my fridge which will surely help too. I have to say that I haven't really been feeling hungry on this diet which makes it a whole lot easier to not be hungry and diet.
<p> My total weight loss in 3 weeks is 5 lbs.
<p> *Nutrisystem is providing their program free of charge for my participation in the Nutrisystem Nation Blogging Program.
<p> BDD (Before Diet Days) I used to really love soft pretzels. A great soft pretzel with just the tiniest hint of salt would be a snack that I really enjoyed. I never really thought about wanting to try any sort of flavored pretzels until I came across Kim and Scott's Gourmet Pretzels.
<p> Kim and Scott's Gourmet Pretzels add a unique twist to the ancient pretzel by creating a variety of delicious flavors, using custom recipes and premium ingredients. Twisted by hand and baked from scratch, their unique soft pretzels make a wonderful snack anytime!
<p> The pretzels are stuffed with the delicious flavors of traditional bavarian, sourdough parmesean, apple cinnamon, chocolate crumb, cinnamon roll, cream cheese, and egg and cheese. Did you think I was done? No way! There's more. Grilled cheese, pizza pretzel and spinach feta are the next great flavors featured in the line. There's also a gluteen free soft pretzel, along with stuffed bagels in the flavors of cinnamon roll, cream cheese, and egg and cheese. As you can see, there's really a flavor for anyone's liking. Each box contains 4 large pretzels. Don't they sound fabulous?
<p> I was sent three boxes of flavors to try. I received cinnamon roll, sourdough parmesean, and spinach feta.
<p> A delicious assortment of Kim and Scott's Gourmet Pretzels:
<p> These pretzels are:All-Natural Source of Whole Grain No Trans Fats
<p> Premium Ingredients Twisted by Hand &amp; Made from Scratch No Hydrogenated Oils
<p> Microwavable or Oven baked Made in a Nut-Free Faciility No Preservatives
<p> My dad tried the spinach and feta pretzel. He said the pretzel was the softest one he's ever had and growing up in NYC he's had many soft pretzels from street vendors in his lifetime. He said this one takes the cake in freshness. It was soft, flakey and just delicious. The color of the pretzel was golden brown and it had just the slightest bit of chewiness to it.
<p> The pretzel was stuffed with a large amount of spinach and feta cheese. The flavor of the spinach was very prevalent and it melted in your mouth. My dad said he loved the pretzel taste combined with both flavors inside. It was a unique combination. The feta cheese had a wonderful rich flavor that was so pleasant. He said the flavor of the cheese mixed with the spinach was awesome and the flavors complimented each other so perfectly. He actually liked the pretzel so much he had to have a second one right after!
<p> The cinnamon roll pretzel puts any cinnamon roll pastry to shame! This one was sweet, but not too sweet. The pretzel was stuffed with delicious cinnamon roll flavor and each bite was more delicious than the last. The flavor of the cinnamon was very noticable and it was combined with a sweet layer inside. My dad really liked it and said it would be a great snack, or an even nicer dessert.
<p> Lastly, the sourdough parmesean pretzel was sampled. My dad is a huge lover of sourdough bread, so he knew he would love this pretzel. The pretzel was extremely fresh and a generous layer of parmesean cheese baked into the pretzel. The parmesean cheese was excellent and paired with the sourdough bread pretzel, it was heavenly. The flavors were very strong in this pretzel and it was hard for my dad to not have more than one at a time!
