<p> There's only one computer in my household and it's my boyfriend's. I have my laptop from college but it's painfully slow and very old. So when my boyfriend's using his laptop, I only have my iPad. I can't really blog on my iPad, it's a challenge and doesn't work very well. I used to have to wait to use the computer and that was annoying. Now my days of annoyance are gone!
<p> Sena Cases is a luxury mobile device accessory designer offering classy, stylish protective leather cases for today’s most popular mobile devices. There are cases for phones, smartphones, tablets, laptops, readers, MP3 players and more. The unique cases not only offer an upscale, quality and appearance, but also provide exceptional functionality. The cases are built to last and quality made.
<p> Sena would make an excellent gift for someone who just bought an iPad or a kindle. Let them protect their new electronic device, but also keep it in a stylish case!
<p> I've been wanting an iPad keyboard for a long time. It's hard and frustrating to write emails or surf the web when you keep pushing the wrong letters on the screen. Instead of going to yahoo.com, you go to yafhoo.com. Not quite the same, huh? I've been eyeing various iPad keyboard online and drooling over them, and hoping to own one of them soon.
<p> Well my lucky day eventually came when Sena Cases gave me the opportunity to review a black leather iPad keyboard case. I was sent a black leather keyboard case and I love it! The case also comes in red or orange as well.The case is a sleek black one that is classic. I love black electronics cases, they are always in style and truly look great all the time.
<p> The keyboard is an integrated bluetooth keyboard for iPad 1. It connects to the iPad very easily. Just easily slip the iPad into the case and turn the power switch on. Once you've done that, push the connect button on the top of the case. After that, go into your settings on the iPad and activate the bluetooth setting. The keyboard is then connected with your iPad The case came with no instructions, so I had to go on the website and find them. I do think the case should come with them, because not everyone would think to do that right away. The buttons on the keyboard are easy to push and I had no trouble typing on the iPad at all. I won't make any typo's now!
<p> I love that this small little case turns my iPad into a mini computer! There's a stand that pops out in the back of the case, so as to easily prop the iPad up on a desk or table. The case stands up without any problems. The case easily folds up to be stored in a bag, purse, or drawer too.
<p> I'm really happy that I'll now always have computer access even when my boyfriend's using the laptop! This would be the perfect gift for a technology lover who you normally don't know what to buy for. They will love it! Why not treat yourself too?
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thanks to Sena Cases for providing me with this complimentary case in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.
<p> Pets are our babies, and we do whatever we can to make them feel loved, safe, and wanted. Why should we let them have to feel anxiety or be freightened? Pets give us unconditional love and happiness, it's time to give the same back to them!
<p> Thundershirt is the proven solution for dog anxiety. With its patent-pending design, Thundershirt’s gentle, constant pressure has a dramatic calming effect for most dogs if they are anxious, fearful or over-excited. Based on surveys completed by over two thousand customers, over 80% of dogs show significant improvement in symptoms when using Thundershirt. Thundershirt is already helping tens of thousands of dogs around the world, and is recommended by thousands of veterinarians and dog trainers.
<p> If your dog is fearful of loud sudden noises, has travel anxiety, or even hyperacticity, the Thundershirt would be perfect for them.
<p> My dog has very bad separation anxiety. Whenever anybody leaves, she lays by the door and just howls! It doesn't matter if they are gone 10 minutes or 3 hours, she will continuously howl. It's very sad and I feel awful for her. I knew I wanted to do whatever I could to help her.
<p> I received a gray Thundershirt and couldn't wait to try it on her! Even before you open the garage door to my house, you can hear her crying and howling. This happens everytime somebody leaves, without fail. I put the thundershirt on her before I left. It fit her great and looked very cute on. Some dogs may not like wearing it, but Colby didn't seem to mind at all. I told her good-bye and gave her a kiss. She just looked at me and started crying a little bit. I hoped the Thundershirt would calm her down and help her to feel more relaxed while I was gone.
<p> Once I left I was anxious and was hoping that she was okay. Once I got home and went to open my garge door, I heard no crying or howling! Her crying is always very loud! I opened the door and she was laying in the couch wagging her tail. Usually she is laying on the floor howling. She seemed much calmer and happier, and that made me happy too. I was very impressed with the Thundershirt! I think that the more you use it, the better results you will have. This fantastic product has made my Colby's life a lot easier. It truly breaks your heart to hear your baby upset. I will be using this on a constant basis now. Thank you Thundershirt!
<p> This would be the perfect calming aide if you have an anxious dog. Don't let your dog have anxiety for another day!

<p> This is my third post for Kiddie Academy. I had never thought about opening a franchise, but this is something that is working well for individuals like Dwight!
<p> Dwight Wilkinson opened his Kiddie Academy, located at 1020 Horsham Road in North Wales, Pennsylvania, on September 8, 2003, at the age of 42. He has remained dedicated to educational excellence, which along with a passion for children’s mental and physcial development, has helped him and his academy achieve success.
<p> Background: As a previous business owner of a Haagen Dazs Ice Cream Shop, Dwight Wilkinson was looking for a business concept that would grant him more time with his wife and four children. He began researching opportunities with a Monday - Friday schedule to help accommodate his family-oriented lifestyle and responsibilities as a community volunteer and coach of his children’s soccer, basketball and baseball teams. Dwight narrowed his search down to the child care franchise industry due to his love of children and managerial background. After two years of looking at child care companies, he chose Kiddie Academy for its warm, caring personality. He found Kiddie Academy to have a vested interest in the success and well-being of their franchisees. He has remained dedicated to educational excellence, which along with a passion for children’s mental and physical development, has helped him and his academy achieve success.
<p> Goals: Dwight often sets goals around educational achievements and finds opportunities for his academy to reach a higher standard. He continually looks to improve the quality of services at his Kiddie Academy, whether through hiring qualified, passionate staff members or adding educational resources. Dwight hopes to grow his academy’s enrollment and is looking into the possibility of opening a second location in the future.
<p> Challenges: Each new generation of parents find a new way to communicate with each other, their children and their child care providers. For Dwight, finding the most effective way to communicate with his families has proved to have its challenges. However, by experimenting with various communication methods, including take home folders, outdoor signage and technology, he has learned more about the consumer and how to reach his target audience.
<p> Results: Dwight’s hard work and commitment has earned him great success. His academy was recently licensed by the Department of Education and accredited by AdvancEd, which is an achievement no other child care in his area can claim. From a personal stance, becoming a Kiddie Academy franchisee has been both fun and rewarding for Dwight. It has given him a better quality of life and allowed him time to spend with his children and family.
<p> More information about Kiddie Academy franchising opportunities can be found at their website and you can follow them on Twitter too!
<p> *DISCLOSURE*I have a 3 month relationship with Kiddie Academy for which I am being compensated for. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine, and not based on anything else.

<p> As you all know, I'm a huge lover of desserts and anything sweet. I have a sweet tooth a mile wide! I enjoy trying new treats and expanding my dessert palate. I've only had a cannoli a few times in my life and I wanted to refresh my taste buds with the decadent cannoli taste! There's nothing better than a crispy treat filled with sweet cream.
<p> Golden Cannoli is the headquarters for delicious cannolis! They sell traditional and chocolate cannoli shells and sweetened ricotta filling to make your taste buds sing. These sweet treats are perfect for any time of day when you're looking to indulge in something fantastic. I've never heard of a chocolate cannoli until finding Golden Cannoli, but I knew that it had my name written all over it! The sweetened ricotta filling is provided in your order as well.
<p> The company generously sent me over a few boxes of shells and a large bag of filling to get the cannoli party started!
<p> I decided to dig into the chocolate shells first. When I opened the box, this is what emerged.
<p> My heart instantly turned into liquid chocolate when seeing the fabulous shells! They are beautiful!
<p> The chocolate shell was large and the inside had a lot of room to be filled with the filling. I snipped the edge of the filling bag and the beautiful white filling emerged and lusciously filled the interior of the cannoli. It was easy to fill the treat and I felt like a pastry chef! I had a good time filling the shell too. Once the cannoli was filled I couldn't wait to dig in. The cannoli had a permanent date with my stomach. :)Usually cannoli's have chocolate chips in them, but I opted not to put in any. The cannoli shells came with cute Valentine's Day sprinkles too!
<p> When you take that first bite, you're literally in cannoli heaven! The shell was perfectly crispy and very fresh. It had wonderful crunch that I really enjoyed. The chocolate flavor was sweet and very noticeable, which was great for me because I'm a big chocolate lover. The cool filling was sweet and refreshing and full of great flavor. I didn't put too much filling in my cannoli because I didn't want it extremely sweet. The filling pairs perfectly with the chocolate flavor and it was a fantastic combination. Each bite was better than the next and I truly look forward to having my next cannoli soon!
<p> I highly recommend these cannoli's for your next dinner party or social function. Everyone will love them and you'll be very popular for serving them!

<p> Granola is one of those versatile foods that taste great when mixed with practically anything. Pair granola with honey, cinnamon, chocolate chips, m&amp;ms, peanuts, or even fruit and it tastes awesome. I love that granola is a great mid-day snack, perfect for school lunches, and even delicious on top of ice cream too! Those crunchy clusters are truly irresistible.
<p> Nature's Path was found by Arran and Ratana Stephens in 1985. Nature’s Path Organic Foods® was formed because of their passion for creating healthy, delicious, organic breakfast food. It’s Nature’s Path’s reason for being, which explains why it is the number one organic cereal manufacturer in North America.
<p> If you're looking for delicious and natural foods, please turn your attention to Nature's Path. They produce whole grain cereals, hot cereals, pancake mix and waffles, granola, granola bars and more! The products come in a range of different flavors and there's something for anyone's taste.
<p> Nature's Path has recently come out with four new Love Crunch granolas. I've had the Love Crunch cereal before and it was heavenly. I knew that I couldn't pass up the chance to try these new snacks! The packaging of the granola is very cute. I love the little "window" that the front has so you can view the yummy snack that's about to meet its match with your stomach!
<p> The Love Crunch Granola comes in four flavors:
<p> Aloha Blend – a tropical treat filled with pineapple, coconut and white chocolate chunks with 14 grams of Whole Grains per serving, no cholesterol, low sodium and no trans fat.
<p> a deliciously sweet blend of green apples, pecans and cinnamon, with omega-3 and fiber-rich chia seeds that has 15 grams of Whole Grains per serving, no cholesterol, low sodium, no trans fat and is a good source of ALA Omega-3.
<p> a melt-in-your-mouth combination of carrots, raisins, yogurt, pecans and pineapple with 15 grams of Whole Grains per serving, no cholesterol, low sodium and no trans fat.
<p> the perfect marriage of flax granola, strawberries, raspberries, coconut and dark chocolate chunks that has 14 grams of Whole Grains per serving, no cholesterol, low sodium, no trans fat and is an excellent source of ALA Omega-3.
<p> These granolas were fantastic. The granola was large and full of flavor and each bite did not disappoint! I loved that they have such a high amount of whole grains per serving. That's very important to me!
<p> The dark chocolate with raspberries was hands down my favorite. I had a VERY hard time not eating the whole bag in one sitting. It was just beyond good! I love any foods that combine raspberry and chocolate together, and this granola definitely had my name written all over it. :) The fresh flavor of the raspberries and the dark chocolate chunks were magical together! The granola was perfectly crunchy and had just the right amount of sweetness to it. The dark chocolate had a mild hint of sweetness, the raspberry pieces were tart and the coconut was definitely noticeable too. The raspberries and chocolate chunks were evenly distributed throughout the whole bag. This granola would go well with a small bowl of yogurt, or even with a bowl of fresh fruit too. Everything tied together wonderfully to create my new favorite granola! I highly recommend that you try this snack if you haven't already. It's highly addictive though! :)
<p> The apple crumble reminded me of a warm, fresh out of the oven apple sweet treat but without all of the fat and calories. The pairing of cinnamon and apples is such a classic pairing, and I enjoyed the way they taste together. The pecans gave the granola an extra notch of crunchiness which I loved! The apple pieces were petite, crunchy, and sweet, and evenly distributed throughout the granola. The cinnamon gave the granola a nice kick of sugary sweetness. This is a great snack to indulge in whenever you're looking for a pick-me-up treat.
<p> I was not a big fan of the carrot cake granola. I know many people like carrot cake and would appreciate this granola.
<p> With one bite of the aloha blend granola, I was transported to an exotic island in Hawaii! The combination of the pineapple, coconut, and white chocolate was a very interesting one. The pineapple was fresh and sweet, the coconut was smooth and refreshing, and the white chocolate gave the granola the sweet touch that it needed. With each bite of the granola, your taste buds are delighted with fantastic flavors! The granola chunks are large and in charge and each bite was better than the last. I would certainly recommend this blend of granola if you're looking for a unique snack!
<p> To spread the love even more, for each bag of Love Crunch sold, Nature’s Path will donate the equivalent in cereal or cash (up to $1 million) to food banks. This “Bite4Bite” initiative bundles the goodwill of all the consumers buying Love Crunch into what Nature’s Path calls “love miracles” by helping to ease hunger for those who need it most.

<p> Even though I'm way past the age for animated movies, there are still some Disney classics from my childhood that I love. I never get tired of them and they always make me smile when I watch them. There's nothing like watching a feel-good movie that brings back memories of when you were younger.
<p> Lady and The Tramp is a classic love story that unfolds in the best Disney tradition. A lovely young pedigreed Cocker Spaniel named Lady, who lives a pampered life, finds herself falling romantically for Tramp, an amorous street-smart pooch without prospects. Although they have fun together on several dates, including a sentimental spaghetti dinner by moonlight at Tony’s restaurant, their relationship is strained not only by Lady’s loyalty to her human family and their newborn baby, but by Tramp’s devil-may-care attitude that eventually gets Lady in trouble and tossed into the dog pound. However, good-hearted Tramp redeems himself by saving the baby from potential harm and thus wins Lady’s love and the affection of her human family.
<p> Lady and The Tramp arrives on Blu-ray Diamond edition for the first time on February 7, 2012 from Walt Disney Studios. One of the great classics…more glorious than ever in dazzling Disney Blu-ray high definition!
<p> Lady and The Tramp is a movie that's great for all ages. Your children will fall in love with the movie and the characters in no time. You'll sympathize with Lady during some points in the movie and you'll root for the Tramp too! There are some tricks and surprises along the way. I just watched the movie today for the first time in many years and I still thought it was cute. It's funny how Disney movies today are not made like this anymore. There's something missing in children's movies today. I wish they were still made like this! The blu-ray high definition quality is perfect and crystal clear. It looked fantastic on my TV.
<p> This is one of the more famous scenes of the movie
<p> The trailer:
<p> If your children have not seen this movie, I urge you to share some classic Disney with them. If you're a child of the 80's, this would be great for you to reminisce with too!

<p> If you're in near Tucson, AZ and need storage I have a great option for you.
<p> It is always nice to maintain a clutter free home, but is not always possible. As families grow there is bound to be an increase in items cluttering the house. Or, as loved ones pass on, they leave us with their most valued and cherished items. Unfortunately, most of us just don’t have the storage space in our homes for all this stuff. Additionally, those same people are of the mindset that they may use these items down the road, so parting with currently unused possessions just doesn’t seem feasible. Other items that are passed down from generation to generation should not be disregarded either. In the past we have been forced to shove these unused items into closets, attics and basement, which provided less than ideal storage solutions. Luckily, we now have the option of storage units, which provide optimal storage across the country.
<p> If living in the Tucson area, you will want to look to Tucson storage for all of your storing needs. You will find the best comparison rates on various sized units. There is a unit and a price for every storage need available. Prices will vary from location to location, and based on the size of the unit. Additional costs may arise depending on the type of storage unit you prefer. Features like additional security and climate control tend to cost more. Despite what you are looking for you will find it with Tucson Storage, which offers some of the best rates that are close to home.

<p> If you know me by now, you realize that I have a big sweet tooth. I would implement dessert into the food group pyramid if they would allow me! There's nothing like having a warm cookie that's freshly baked out of the oven on a cold, winter's day. Cookies and brownies and other yummies are comfort foods that are best shared with friends and family over warm and fun conversation.
<p> Alecia Bakery is the collaboration of a passionate baker and businessman with an eye for quality. They are a NYC bakery that prides themselves on producing truly artisanal, all natural baked goods. Their treats are made in small batches and adhere to traditional methods and in-house created recipes. Using high-quality and unprocessed ingredients, hand-chopping chocolate, and toasting nuts to golden perfection, they produce incomparable sweets.
<p> They honor the slow and local food movements and produce in a sustainable manner. Emphasizing local and seasonal produce in their house made purees, they look to Red Jacket Orchards, Jersey Fresh Farms and other NYC Greenmarket gems for the very best of every season. They use Ronnybook Farms butter and cream and Red Bee Honey to produce their rich, delicious toffees and caramels. When available, they choose organic over conventional ingredients.
<p> If you're looking for classic favorites with a modern twist, I suggest Alecia Bakery.
<p> What really caught my eye about the bakery is that they feel strongly about animals and truly believe in rescuing. A portion of their proceeds are donated to Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals organizations. This is wonderful because I am a big animal lover and I pride them on doing this.
<p> I received a large package filled to the top with goodies! In that box were gorgeous dark chocolate with sea salt cookies, german chocolate brownies, an olive oil loafs, a chocolate loafs, a banana nut bread loaf, mint chocolate chip brownies, caramel and sea salt brownies, and more! Everything was packaged so nicely and I loved the pretty ribbons adorning each box of brownies or cookies. I was in awe of all of the fabulous treats and I of course couldn't wait to dig in!
<p> The treats are very large, so I suggest sharing with a friend, or eating half and having the rest later. I first indulged in the dark chocolate with sea salt cookie, which I split with my boyfriend.
<p> Look at this work of art. :)
<p> I had heard for some time that sea salt in desserts really brings out the flavor and gives more personality. This is true! The cookie was absolutely beautiful and very large! It had big chunks of dark chocolate dotted throughout the cookie. Alecia Bakery did not skimp on the chocolate chunks! The round piece of heaven was not as soft as a normal cookie, and was a bit harder. It had a great flavor and each bite had an equal amount of chocolate in it. The sea salt was an interesting added bonus and definitely brought out the fantastic chocolate flavor! Even though the sea salt and chocolate were paired together, each had an equal balance. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the cookie and couldn't wait to try more Alecia treats.
<p> The next day, I tried the mint chocolate brownie. I love when mint is added to chocolate and I knew that I had to try this. The fact that the brownie was sitting uneaten in my kitchen had to change! The round brownies are baked in 3" individual portions and they are very cute! I'm sorry that I forgot to take a picture of the brownie before I ate it. I am not sure if the camera could have handled its deliciousness though! The brownie was fantastic! It was soft with a wonderful, rich chocolate flavor throughout. The treat was fudgey and rich, just like how a brownie should be. The mint flavor was noticeably there, and each bite had an equal amount of chocolate richness and mint. Each bite was better than the first. I was sad when it was gone!
<p> I froze the rest of the treats so I could indulge at later points. I know that they will be just as delicious as the treats that I've already tried. Alecia Bakery ships nationwide, why not indulge in some yummies today? http://www.aleciabakerynyc.com/shop/

<p> This is my second post for Kiddie Academy. I had never thought about opening a franchise, but this is something that is working well for others like the Malangas. They have been running it for almost 16 years now!
<p> Jill and George Malanga opened their first franchised Kiddie Academy in July 1996 at 233 Sparta Avenue in Sparta, New Jersey, at ages 50 and 59.
<p> Fueled by their overwhelming success, they opened their second location at 179 Cahill Cross Road in West Milford, New Jersey, in September 2004. Unlike owners of other child care concepts in the area, the Malangas treat each parent and child as they would a member of their own family, regularly going above and beyond to provide the best service possible.
<p> Background: Jill was a franchisee for NutriSystem, but shortly after the birth of her first child she wanted to shift her attention to her son. When it came time to select a child care facility for him, the options in the area were not up to her standards. As a result, she decided to open a Kiddie Academy franchise, not only for her son but for other parents in the community looking for a better option. George, a former high school teacher and 30-year veteran of the music industry, saw the success of his wife’s venture and decided to follow in her footsteps with a second location shortly after his retirement in 2003. Each time they see a satisfied parent or hear a student’s laugh, the Malangas know that their decision to become Kiddie Academy franchisees was the right one.
<p> Goals: For George and Jill, giving parents peace of mind is their top priority. They regularly consult with parents to provide the best possible service to their children, including waiving the tuition for any student with a parent deployed overseas. With enrollment at both academies nearing capacity, the Malangas are also considering opening a third location in the area.
<p> Challenges: Maintaining the company’s cozy, nurturing atmosphere is always one of Jill’s top concerns, since she operates one of the largest Kiddie Academy facilities in the United States. Kiddie Academy’s innovative curriculum and hands-on approach to educationally-based child care keeps the academies inviting and personal. Jill and George want each parent and child to maintain the special feeling of being part of their Kiddie Academy community.
<p> Results: Jill’s constant drive to make her academy the best it can be has paid off over the years. Events such as date nights and shopping days, as well as pancake breakfasts and end-of-the-year recitals, continuously receive rave reviews from parents and children alike. Not only has she received several awards from both her franchisor and the local community, she has also made quite a difference in the lives of the children who attend her academy – an achievement that cannot be measured by a certificate or plaque, but instead by the smile on a child’s face.
<p> More information about Kiddie Academy franchising opportunities can be found at their websiteand you can follow them on Twitter too!
<p> *DISCLOSURE*I have a 3 month relationship with Kiddie Academy for which I am being compensated for. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine, and not based on anything else.
