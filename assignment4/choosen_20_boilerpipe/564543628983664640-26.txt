<p> There's nothing like baking. I'm always in my kitchen whipping up a patch of peanut butter brownies or chocolate chip cookies. Especially now that the holiday season is here, I'm baking more than ever. I love that cracking some eggs in a bowl, adding flour, sugar, and various other ingredients and then stirring creates delicious baked goods. Everyone loves sweet treats and it's fun to create delicious treats that people go crazy for.
<p> Nostalgia Electrics specializes in home entertainment and family fun. Whether you're looking for a movie theatre popcorn style machine, snow cone maker, or quesadilla maker they have you covered and much more. The machines are fun, affordable and definite conversation starters. How fun would it be to have a chocolate fountain at your Christmas party or next get together? It would be an instant hit!
<p> I was sent a mini cupcake maker for review. I love to make cupcakes so this was right up my alley.
<p> The mini cupcake maker allows you to cook delicious cupcakes and other pastries at home without even turning on an oven. The kit includes a handy tray for serving and displaying your cupcakes as well as a frosting injector with a variety of tips for decorating. It’s great for snack time, party time or anytime! Delectable desserts and hors d'oeuvres are ready in minutes. Features Include: - Makes 7 mini cupcakes at one time - Nonstick coating - Convenient cord storage - Power and preheat indicator lights - 5-7 minutes cooking time - Includes food storage tin, decorating kit and cupcake tray
<p> The concept of this machine is very cute, but in the long run it is easier to make cupcakes in the oven. The batter that you make is a full-sized batter that is the same amount as real cupcake batter. The machine only makes 7 cupcakes at a time and takes about 6 minutes to cook each batch. It is time consuming, and in the end I ended up making 14 brownie bites and then using the rest of the batter for making brownies in the oven. This cupcake maker would be a great activity for your daughter or grand daughter to do with her friends at a sleep over. I know I would have loved to do something like this when I was a kid. I like that it comes with a cute serving tray and decorating kit. It comes with a recipe book which has some yummy cupcake recipes inside. I found my brownie bites recipe in the book. This would be a fantastic present for a girl who loves baked goods but isn't quite yet ready to bake real cupcakes yet.
<p> Here are the brownie bites I made. They were quite yummy! Be careful though because the machine gets VERY hot after the treats are done. I advise you to use a spatula or something to wedge them out. You all know that I LOVE anything chocolate! If you're hosting a Christmas party this year, a great idea would be to make little mini decorated cupcakes with this machine to put on your dessert table. I'm sure they will all be gone instantly!

<p> I have a whole slew of cleaning products under my sink. I frequently buy new products based off of friends and family's recommendations. I always am up for trying a new product to keep my kitchen, bathroom, and surfaces spic and span. I was hearing a lot of good things about Greased Lightning and wanted to give them a try. When I was contacted to review a bottle of it, I was thrilled!
<p> The Greased Lightning family of super-strength degreaser products tackle today's cleaning needs. Their multi-purpose products can be used throughout the home and beyond - from kitchens and bathrooms to garages and patios.
<p> Their everyday household cleaning products include Greased Lightning®; Greased Lightning® Bleach, Antibacterial Kitchen Cleaner, Lemon Blast and Orange Blast. Once the inside of your home is clean, you can move to the garage with their line of automotive products, which includes Greased Lightning® High Performance Cleaner and Degreaser and Greased Lightning® BLAST Auto Shop Degreaser and All Wheel Cleaner.
<p> I love that Greased Lightning is such a versatile cleaner and can be used in so many areas in the home.
<p> I was sent a bottle of super strength Greased Lightning. The product is a multi-purpose cleaner and degreaser. It removes tough stains, grease, soap scum, mildew &amp; more. It's also safe to use as a laundry pretreater which is a nice bonus.
<p> The bottle is an eye-catching bright yellow. You can definitely distinguish it from the other cleaners on the store shelf or underneath your sink too. The bottle is easy to hold, not too heavy, and my fingers fit the grip perfectly. It's easy to spray as well and I had no problem with the solution not coming out. The cleaner has a noticeable smell but it is not too strong at all. The only way I can describe it is as "clean." It's that type of smell that you know your home is truly clean after using it. The solution cleaned my counter tops well and I really think it did a wonderful job! It was easy to rub in and didn't leave any residue or solution behind. I am very satisfied with the product. I will be using this cleaner on the rest of my home and I will be satisfied knowing Greased Lightning is making my house sparkly clean! :)

<p> I'm an avid movie watcher, and I enjoy watching films several times a week. There's nothing like a movie with a fabulous plot and wonderful acting. My favorite movie categories are suspense, comedy, and romances. There's nothing like curling up on the couch after work with a large bowl of popcorn and an entertaining movie.
<p> "The Help is a film based on the bestselling novel about an aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960's, who decides to write a book detailing the African-American maid's point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis." (Quoted from IMDB.) The movie stars Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Bryce Dallas Howard.
<p> I absolutely love this movie. I saw it when it first came out back in August. I was very interested in seeing it and I had heard great reviews. It looked like a very interesting story too. The movie was fantastic. I love period piece movies and the setting and clothes were right on key with the time period. The 1960's had fantastic dresses and hairstyles that I fell in love with. The actors portrayed their characters perfectly and their performances were flawless. I couldn't have asked for a better cast or acting for the movie. The civil rights movement was a very controversial time in history. The film truly showed how difficult life was for African Americans and of course African American maids back then.
<p> I'm so glad that life isn't like this anymore and African Americans aren't treated so poorly. It was such a hard life for them back then and I'm happy that racial equality has improved leaps and bounds since the 1960's. The film captured my interest instantly and I was intrigued the whole time. When it was over I felt like it just began! I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time and I look forward to watching it again soon. If you haven't yet seen this film, I urge you to see it.
<p> The Help arrives on DVD and BluRay on December 6th.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* In exchange for this review I received a copy of the Help on DVD. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> If you know me, you know that I'm a carb fiend. It's no secret! I've never met a roll, bagel, piece of toast, or any other type of bread that I didn't instantly fall in love with. A soft, warm roll with a light coating of butter is definitely the key to my heart. Bring on the carbs and everything will be okay! :)
<p> Stonefire's mission is to provide authentic, worldly flat breads that celebrate a distinct regional taste and honor traditional baking methods and ingredients. The company creates delicious Tandoor Naan, Tandoori Roti, and Mediterranean Pocket Pitas. I've always been a huge fan of Naan bread and I was very excited when I had the opportunity to review some.
<p> I was sent three kinds of Naan bread, 1 original, 1 whole grain, and 1 garlic.
<p> This Naan is made with stone ground, whole grain flour, and is of course a great source of fiber. I love how Naan is so distinguishable because of the many air bubbles and pockets it has. I made a wrap for lunch today using the whole grain Naan. I put in turkey and cheese. I rolled it up and I zapped it in the microwave for a few seconds. It had such a delicious aroma and I love all of my sandwiches warmed up or grilled. The Naan had a great, chewiness to it but was still soft at the same time. The bread was very fresh and tasted perfect! I loved the beautiful wheaty color of the bread too. It had that familiar whole grain rustic taste that I love too. My turkey and cheese paired wonderfully with the bread and it was a truly satisfying lunch that I will be making again!
<p> The garlic Naan is hand-stretched and made with fire roasted garlic and cilantro. I actually used one piece of the Naan to make a personal pizza for myself for dinner last night. I spread some tomato sauce on the surface of the bread and sprinkled shredded cheese over the top of it. I baked it for a few minutes in the oven and it came out looking bubbly, cheesy, and wonderful! I couldn't wait to devour it! I could smell the sauce, cheese, and garlic all at once. It smelled like I was cooking something simply fabulous from scratch, but I wasn't! The pizza was awesome. The Naan had a beautiful golden color to it from being in the oven. I could taste the cilantro and garlic evenly in every bite. The garlic was noticeable but not over the top where it almost became spicy. It really gave my pizza a great kick of flavor which I loved. I really enjoyed the chewiness of the Naan. Sometimes pizza crust can be hard and chewy but this was fluffy, soft, but with a bit of chew. It was just the best! The Naan provided a great blank canvas for creating a fantastic meal.
<p> I have not tried the original Naan yet, but I will be having a piece when I have soup for dinner tonight. I expect it to be just as fabulous as the others. :)
<p> The Naan is really versatile for creating wraps, pizzas, sandwiches, and more. Here are some recipe examples to give you some inspiration in the kitchen.
<p> Fry the bacon in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until crisp. Let cool and cut into small pieces.
<p> Lay the Naan bubble side up on a baking tray, sprinkle with the Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and the cooked bacon. Crack 2 eggs on each Naan and season with salt and pepper.
<p> Place Naan on middle rack of preheated 400F oven and heat for 10-12 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the egg yolks are cooked. Remove from oven and sprinkle with the parsley, chives and green onions.
<p> Spread pesto-mayonnaise mixture over the bottom (flat side) of both naan. Top each naan with chicken, tomato slices, and shredded lettuce. (Try to keep the ingredients away from the edges of the naan for easier roll-up.)
<p> Season with salt and pepper to taste.
<p> Roll up naan and secure with toothpicks, if necessary, to hold together. Cut each roll-up in half. Serve immediately.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win all three varieties of Stonefire Naan, in the flavors of original, garlic, and whole wheat.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> How often do you go on trips and bring back souvenirs for friends or family? You wouldn't normally think of your beloved pets, but why not bring them something back too? It's hard to find something for them that's customized to your trip, but I now have the answer for you! It's important to make your pets feel special and loved too. :)
<p> Les Pets En Voyage is a really unique idea. The owner, Abby Kass started the company with the thought of having a special souvenir meant just for dogs. The website offers New York City themed rain ponchos, travel water/food bowls, bandanas, dog toys, and a catnip toy too. Why not show your special furbaby that you thought of them when traveling without them? Order your dog a poncho and you can relive your own trip memories while your pet enjoys the souvenir.
<p> Colby doesn't have a rain poncho and I knew I had to have a NYC themed one for her! I picked out her size and pretty soon the rain poncho arrived in the mail. I couldn't wait to try it on her. Doesn't Colby look cute? :)
<p> The poncho is absolutely adorable. It fits her perfectly and she actually seems to enjoy wearing it! I think it is comfortable on her and it is a great length too, since she is a small dog. She doesn't always love clothes or jackets on her. I like that the hood of the poncho covers her head too so she doesn't get wet. The material of the poncho is waterproof and lightweight. It's made well and seems built to last. The poncho is perfect for quick bathroom trips outside. The pattern of the poncho is so cute and I love all of the bold and vibrant NYC themed drawings on it. The yellow color of course matches NYC cabs! When you're not using the poncho, simply fold it up in the pouch that it comes in for easy storage. It also has a clip so it can be attached to your belt, purse, or leash for convenient access. It is easy to pack in luggage for your upcoming Thanksgiving or Christmas trip.
<p> If you want your dog to brave the rain in style, Keep Les Pets En Voyage in mind. Any item would be a perfect Christmas present for a NYC native or a former NYC native's dog. Keep your fond NYC memories close to your heart and your dog's too. :)
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Les Pets En Voyage for the complimentary pet poncho in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Pets are our furry babies. We play with them, spend time with them, and make sure they are loved and well taken care of. Why not spoil and indulge them with their favorite treats too? Of course pets can't ask for what they want by speaking, but you know that treats are always in their thoughts. :) Surprise your pet with a tasty bone and they will love you for it.
<p> My Dog's Bakery offers dog treats that are hand decorated and hand made. You can have your dog's name written in dog friendly carob icing on a cute dog bone shaped treat! The treats come in different shapes depending on your preference. If you'd like to have your dog's picture on the bone, the company will make your pooch the star of the bone! These treats make for perfect party favors for dog birthday parties, and they come in different flavors too. The yummies would fit perfectly in your dog's stocking for Christmas too!
<p> Colby was sent an adorable handmade dog treat in the flavor of roast beef and potato with her name on it. I absolutely love it and so does she!Sorry for the glare in the picture.
<p> This is the most adorable dog treat! I love how it came packaged with a pretty bow. Since Colby is a small Bichon Frise, this treat is fairly large for her. It is good because it will last her a while. The dog bone shape is very cute and her name is written in beautiful cursive on the treat. The paw prints are a very cute added extra touch too. She knew the treat was for her because I let her sniff it and she wagged her tail excitedly. I broke her off a small piece and she absolutely loved it! She instantly gobbled it up and licked her lips for more. She can be kind of picky with food sometimes. If she doesn't like something she will just smell it and walk away. When she really loves a certain food, you can instantly tell. Colby's a big fan of meat so it's no surprise that she loves the roast beef flavor of the treat. I can see Colby enjoying this treat for the next week or so.
<p> The treats are healthy, so no need to worry about putting anything bad into your dog's body. The roast beef is low-fat and and only human-grade ingredients go into the treat. Each treat is baked fresh to order. You can guarantee that your dog will go dog-gone crazy for My Dog's Bakery! :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a roast beef and potato dog treat with their dog's name written on it.

<p> Last week I had the pleasure of attending an Ivory soap media party. The party was for Ivory's new campaign which hadn't been updated in 125 years! The event was also to announce the new spokesmom which was Melissa McCarthy. It was a fabulous introduction into Ivory's new focus.
<p> Ivory's target audience is mostly moms and women and I enjoyed hearing how moms trust Ivory for their children and it's a lifelong brand choice. Ivory's new commercials and ad campaign are fun and whimsical and really get their message across perfectly.
<p> The party was a lot of fun and I appreciated the opportunity to be invited. I always love a good party! I know a lot of my readers are moms and I'm sure they use Ivory soap in their house. I'd love to hear how long you've been a loyal consumer.
<p> Melissa is a great spokesmom for the brand. She is fun, funny, and very honest. It's just what Ivory needs!
<p> Here's some pictures from the event.
