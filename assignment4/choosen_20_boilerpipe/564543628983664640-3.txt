<p> All Natural SKYY Infusions Dragon Fruit is a unique, 100% all natural infused experience that delivers the bright, sensual and bold taste of fresh dragon fruit. The newest addition to the all natural SKYY infusions collection.SKYY Infusions dragon fruit is created using a proprietary process that begins with the harvesting of real dragon fruit. The natural dragon fruit flavor is then infused into smooth premium vodka, creating a multi-sensory taste experience bursting with an essence reminiscent of sweet, fresh red berries.
<p> I love the look of the SKYY bottle. It's modern and is the perfect bottle for housing a delicious alcoholic beverage. I had some friends over the other day and I served them some of the SKYY infusions because they are big fans of fruity drinks. I didn't have a glass of it though. They all really loved it and said the taste was very smooth. the vodka did not overpower the fruity taste, but balanced it perfectly in my opinion. First you notice the vodka, then the fruit infusion. The fruit taste was fresh and sweet and bursting with great flavor that tastes sort of like a strawberry. Some friends mixed it with cranberry juice, one mixed it with sprite, and one just drank it straight. My friends really liked how versatile the drink was and how it was so easily mixed with many different beverages.
<p> SIGNATURE COCKTAILS: SKYY Infusions Dragon Fruit has a versatile red berry taste that can be enjoyed straight and mixes well with juices, 7UP®, club soda, tonic and ginger ale for an easy, delicious cocktail at home. SKYY Infusions Dragon Fruit is also delicious when served as a shot, mixed with sour apple liqueur and a squeeze of lime.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:I will be picking FOUR (4) winners who will win a bottle of SKYY Infusions Dragonfruit vodka. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! 2. Please tell me why you would like to win this bottle of SKYY Infusions. (1 entry)

I probably should have asked for help, but I was determined to do it on my own and I did! The pillow encasements were the easiest to put on. I love the clean look of the white too. I thought that sleeping with the encasements on my bed would be slightly uncomfortable, but I didn't feel it at all which was great.

<p> Cupcakes are one of my most favorite desserts ever. A cupcake can be dressed up in so many delicious and different ways. Chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting? YUM! Chocolate peanut butter swirl cupcake with a light chocolate icing with sprinkles on top? You freakin' bet!!!
<p> Stuffed Cupcakes is a cupcake bakery based out of Nutley, New Jersey. They serve amazing cupcakes that are stuffed with out of this world items like strawberry custard, vanilla mousse, chocolate amaretto custard, raspberry filling, boston cream, malted milk ball custard, and much more. They were even featured on The Today Show, My Fair Wedding with David Tutera, the 2010 Emmy Awards, and Oprah's "Live your Best Life Weekend" in 2010. They were also featured in The New York Times. These are some serious cupcakes we're workin' with!
<p> A delicious assortment of 12 gorgeous cupcakes arrived at my door yesterday. It was perfect timing because I had my aunt, grandma, and dad for dinner tonight, and these would be excellent to serve for dessert.
<p> Fandango-chocolate cupcake stuffed with caramel mousse topped with vanilla icing and a caramel.
<p> Three cupcakes were enjoyed tonight and my family raved that they were the best cupcakes that they've ever tasted! They thought they were extremely fresh for being delivered yesterday and couldn't believe how gorgeous and large they were.
<p> The texture of the peanut butter blast cupcake was soft and moist. Rich, flavorful and just simply divine was the first words that came to my aunt's mind of the peanut butter flavor. The chocolate mousse was airy and delicate and paired with the sweet and thick chocolate icing, it was pure perfection. The nuts gave the cupcake a nice crunchy bonus too. It was truly a blast of a cupcake.
<p> The red velvet was truly a delightful cupcake. It was a moist and spongey cupcake that was a beautiful shade of red. It was filled with smooth and sweet vanilla custard that was stuffed to the core and was melt in your mouth delicious. It went perfectly with the rich and creamy cream cheese frosting. This is truly a match for anyone's sweet tooth.
<p> Lastly, the mom's favorite cupcake was devoured, and let me tell you it was truly a favorite! The vanilla cupcake had an excellent vanilla flavor and the texture of the cupcake itself was beyond words. The chocolate mousse stuffed inside was whipped and airy and simply wonderful. The consistency of the chocolate icing was thick and a generous amount was inside. The chocolate sprinkles were a nice surprise inside as well.
<p> These cupcakes would make a fabulous birthday present, would be great to serve after a dinner party, or just a great "I'm thinking of you" present too. You cannot go wrong with these fabulous gems for any other event as well.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win an assortment of 12 cupcakes similiar to the ones that I reviewed from Stuffed Cupcakes.1. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win these cupcakes. (1 entry)

<p> I am down 1 more pound on Nutrisystem this week for a total loss of 5 lbs. Very exciting. I've been drinking much more water too which is helping me. I need to incorporate more vegetables in the diet though. I am eating a ton of fruit though which I love. I also haven't been exercising as much as I should because I am constantly on the go. This is also something else I need to work on.
<p> I've really been enjoying the Italian herb pizza, the chicken noodle soup, and most of the pasta dishes. The fudge swirl ice cream has been my new favorite dessert too!
<p> Not too long ago, I did a review for Kirkland's for an ottoman. I've been enjoying that ottoman since I received it. I knew I eventually wanted to do another Kirkland's review because I love their products. Well, my wish has come true!
<p> Kirkland's presents a broad selection of distinctive merchandise, including framed art, mirrors, candles, lamps, picture frames, accent rugs, garden accessories and artificial floral products. Our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise, as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for giving as gifts. We provide our customers an engaging shopping experience characterized by a diverse, ever-changing merchandise selection at surprisingly attractive prices. Our stores offer a unique combination of style and value that has led to our emergence as a leader in home décor and has enabled us to develop a strong customer loyalty.
<p> Whether you are looking for that funky silver mirror, that great cranberry smelling candle or a great area rug, Kirkland's has you covered. The best part is they don't hurt your wallet by doing so.
<p> I was sent a gorgeous "Poppy Fields" picture frame from Kirkland's to review.
<p> This frame looks excellent in my house. I have a lot of tan, black, and red colors in my house, so it matches perfectly. I am always looking to add that pop of color in among all of the neutral colors too. I love the pale yellow, red, and green of the frame. The frame adds warmth to my living room and I really like that. It has a lot of personality and the pretty flowers remind me of late spring/early summer. I really like the wavy shape of the frame too, it gives it that modern touch. Now all I need to do is put a picture in it and I'll be good to go!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win a Poppy Fields picture frame from Kirkland's.1. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win this picture frame. (1 entry)

<p> I usually have my hair up, just because it gets annoying having it in my face constantly. I usually put it up in a ponytail, or just some kind of updo. If I have my hair down I like to wear a headband to push it out of my face.
<p> CoverYourHair has taken your hair needs into consideration. They offer hair ties, head scarves, headbands, barrettes, hair ties, hats, hair clips, and more. This company truly offers any hair products that anyone could ever want or need.
<p> I was sent a pack of Goody bobby pins (I go through these things like water and I'm constantly losing them), a lace satin beaded bard beadband in black, and a zippered pony in pink.
<p> Goody is a brand that I've trusted for years now. They always have products that always satisfy. The bobby pins are strong and stay in securely. They withstand any kind of pinning in my hair and I like that they only come out when I take them out.
<p> The zippered pony is nice. It would look cute in my hair if I put it in a ponytail. The bow is very girly and cute and the zippered detail gives it that edge. It stays securely in my hair and is easy to loosen when I take it out too. I've had some hair ties before that get stuck in my hair which hurts.
<p> The black lace headband is adorable. I love headbands that have some sort of large flower or bow or girly design on it. The flower is large, but not so large where it's obnoxious and distracting. The beads inside the flower give it that elegant touch. The headband is comfortable to wear and doesn't give me any discomfort at all. I like the way it looks a lot.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win a $25 gift certificate to CoverYourHair.com.2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win this gift certificate. (1 entry)

<p> Pretzels are not a stranger in my diet. I love them as a quick snack or even paired with a sandwich for lunch. They are a fast snack that you can have on the go, are low in calories, and come in so many delicious flavors.
<p> Pretzel Crisps are a type of cracker with the appearance and flavor of a pretzel. They come in the deli style flavors of original, buffalo wing, garlic parmesean, everything, and sesame. The modern classic flavors are classic, cinnamon toast, tuscan three cheese, and supreme. There's even a new dessert line from Pretzel Crisps called Indulgents. Dark chocolate crunch, peanut butter crunch, and white chocolate &amp; peppermint are being created in this line. Sounds delicious!
<p> Pretzels Crisps® are a great alternative to potato chips and other snack foods. They contain 110 calories per serving and no fat (10-11 crisps) compared with 150 calories and 10 gram of fat (1 g saturated) per one ounce serving for potato chips.
<p> I was sent a full assorted case of deli style pretzel crisps. I've had the pleasure of trying these crisps before and knew I was setting myself up for a great snack. I received 2 bags of garlic parmesean, 2 bags of buffalo wing, 3 bags of original, 3 bags of everything, and 2 bags of seasme. I also received a Pretzel Crisps branded tote bag, and some free product coupons. Wow, looks like I hit the pretzel jackpot!
<p> These pretzels are amazing!! They combine two of my favorite snacks, a pretzel and a cracker. The pretzels are small and flat, but don't be fooled by their small size because they pack a fantastic crunch! They fit into my diet as a snack, so I allowed myself to have a few of them.
<p> I tried the original and the sesame so far. I don't like the everything and the buffalo wing flavors, so I won't be trying those. Eventually I will try the garlic parmesean. The sesame has a great toasty flavor that is addicting. The sesame flavor is very prevalent and I really enjoyed it.
<p> The original was my favorite. The flavor was that of a normal pretzel, no special bells or whistles of any kind. The flavor was crunchy, salty, and delicious all rolled into one. These crisps would go great with a packed lunch for school or work, or just a midday pick-me-up snack.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win a free product coupon for a bag of Pretzel Crisps, and a Pretzel Crisps branded totebag.2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win this prize pack. (1 entry)

<p> I was sent a delicious box of dark chocolate alfajores. I've never had anything like these before and couldn't wait to try one. Yes, I did try a very small bite myself, but I'm sorry I HAD to :) The alfajores come in the flavors of white chocolate, dark chocolate, and meringue. These delicious chocolates are delicate, melt in your mouth confection, composed of two thin buttery sablé (shortbread like) cookies with a smooth and rich dulce de leche interior. This dark chocolate alfajor is enrobed in a thin, perfectly tempered, shell of real bittersweet couverture chocolate. In other words, I think these alfajores are a small bite of heaven! :)
<p> I'm using stock photos from the makers of the alfajores, so please excuse the old dates on them.
<p> The box arrived looking like this:
<p> When I opened them up I saw very nicely wrapped alfajores that didn't stay wrapped for long! :)
<p> The alfajores were delicious. I had a small bite like I said because I am on a diet, but they looked so good I couldn't resist. When you first look at them, they have the same shape as a chocolate covered oreo, but are much much bigger. Tons of chocolate and sweet dulce de leche flavor are packed into this little gem. The chocolate smells sweet and very fresh. When you bite inside, you have a rush of chocolate flavor that hits you instantly, followed by a flaky buttery shortbread cookie that provides a great fabulous crunch. Then you see this:Doesn't that just look like something out of this world!? It looks like it would be crunchy inside but it's not. That's a very generous layer of dulce de leche that is sweet and just perfect. These alfajores as a whole are amazing. The ingredients are fresh and they are made with dedication. If you try these, I guarantee you will absolutely love them.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner who will win a box of dulce de leche alfajores.2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win these delicious treats. (1 entry)

<p> I'm a big snacker. Whether I'm having some saltine crackers, a small bowl of grapes or even a handful of seasoned almonds, it all works for me. Small snacks in moderation keep me going throughout the day.
<p> Sahale Snacks crafts and markets natural, gourmet snacks and is dedicated to helping people snack better.
<p> Our first line of snacks, the nut blends, are unique combinations of premium nuts, dried fruits, and exotic spices, each reflecting a beautiful location, culture and/or culinary tradition somewhere in the world. They are all natural, delicious, conveniently packaged, and full of nutrition. Recently we added a line of lightly glazed nuts with great fruits like raspberry, strawberry, cranberry and pomegranate.
<p> I was sent two bags of snacks to try. Tuscan seasoned almonds and barbeque seasoned almonds.
<p> The barbeque almonds are seasoned with a proprietary "dry rub" spice blend and accented with tangy buttermilk ranch. Then, they're slow roasted to smoky, spicy-sweet perfection. My boyfriend opted to try these nuts as he loves barbeque. As soon as you open the bag, you're hit with a strong aroma of seasonings and barbeque. Upon trying the nut, he said he was hit with a spicy kick of flavor instantly, but that spice was paired with some sweetness too. The nut was fresh and crunchy but when he bit into it, he was hit with a large wave of spiciness that he didn't expect. He said that it was unlike any nut he's ever had before and it certainly had a unique taste.
<p> Next, the Tuscan almonds were sampled. Grated parmesan cheese and sun dried tomato are partnered with a blend of Tuscan herbs, then oven roasted with whole almonds to create a bold, savory snack. The bag contained a strong parmeasean and herb aroma that reminded me of a delicious cheese spread on a herb cracker. The initial thoughts were that the parmesean was the dominant flavor, but there was a subtle hint of tomato as well. The nut does contain a little bit of spice, but I am not sure where it comes from, possibly an herb? It has a satisying crunch when bitten into.

<p> Ice cream reminds me of summer and my childhood. Warm, carefree days of playing and having a delicious bowl of chocolate ice cream or a fruity popsicle after dinner. Ice cream is such a comfort food and everyone has a a certain favorite that they love.
<p> Mikawaya Mochi has celebrated nearly a century of bringing Japanese pastries to America. The company celebrated its 99th anniversary in 2008 of Mikawaya being in Los Angeles, California. The company was named after Mikawa, a city in Japan. While "ya" at the end of the name means store in Japanese.
<p> Mikawaya offers delicious and authentic various Japanese pastries and ice cream. Check out these regional delicacies!This is a large Kuri Manju, which is cookie like dough surrounding a sweetened white bean paste. This is a favorite in Japan. This pastry also has chunks of real chestnuts inside.
<p> Or how about a lemon roll?This famous jelly roll cake is created with our own special sponge cake and instead of strawberry we have used a sweet lemon filing.
<p> I was sent two boxes of Moch green tea and chocolate ice cream. The ice cream is unique as it comes in small little circular scoops instead of how it usually is in a container. The flavors come in red bean, vanilla, chocolate, green tea, strawberry, mango, and Kona coffee.
<p> My mom reviewed the ice cream and really enjoyed it. Green tea is an acquired taste I think. Not everyone likes it, but if you do enjoy it, you REALLY like it. I've never had green tea ice cream before, but have only had a cup of actual green tea. The flavor was very true to form and it was delicious. My mom said the subtle mint flavor of the ice cream was enjoyable. The flavor of the tea is very prevalent throughout the ice cream and combines very well with the creamy aspect of the ice cream.
<p> The chocolate ice cream was just perfect, my mom said. She said it was sweet, delicious and had a marshmallow consistency just like the green tea too. The chocolate flavor was rich and just outstanding! It was not too hard, but just the right consistency and it was very smooth too. She said she doesn't usually like chocolate ice cream, but this one was the exception. The ice cream was a perfect shade of deep chocolate brown too.

<p> Cheese is something that I really love. String cheese, cheese on sandwiches, or even cheese flavored snacks can't do wrong in my book! Although cheesecake is not so much on my agenda anymore.
<p> Sargento is the leading national packager and marketer of shredded, snack and specialty cheeses sold under the Sargento brand, cheese and non-cheese snack food items and ethnic sauces.
<p> When I think of cheese, Sargento comes to mind. They create fantastic and quality cheese products that are rich with flavor and texture. Their commercials are memorable and that catch phrase of "Persnickey People, Exceptional Cheese" easily gets stuck in one's head. Sargento is a company built on trust and fabulous cheese products.
<p> I was sent free product coupons from Sargento for review purposes. Did I want cheese sticks, mozzarella cheese, muenster cheese, provolone, or swiss? It was a hard toss-up because all the flavors are great.
<p> I settled on a package of reduced fat provolone cheese.
<p> I love Sargento cheese. I've been buying it for years and I just love the taste of it. It's fresh, made with dedication, and is just overall a great cheese. The taste of the provolone is sharp and rich and truly delicious. I love that I can have all of the great flavor of the cheese, with less fat! Provolone is my favorite cheese, the taste is like no other. It's great for melting for grilled cheese, putting on a nice turkey sandwich, or just eating straight out of the package (which I am guilty of!) It's a versatile cheese that goes with so much.

<p> They say variety is the spice of life, so why not spice up your food in a delicious way through seasonings? Find the perfect blend of seasonings for that juicy steak or that succulent chicken breast, and you'll be a-okay.
<p> For Carol Bernick, Executive Chairman of the Alberto-Culver Company, necessity really was the mother of invention. In the 1980's, when Carol was a marketing exec at the Alberto Culver Co., she was frustrated with the products available to flavor the nutritious meals she prepared at home for her family. She needed a convenient way to flavor the food without using salt. So, Carol got creative in the kitchen and invented a salt-free blend of her own. Working with a variety of spice suppliers, Carol tasted, tested and tweaked until the blend in the bottle was just right. The result is Mrs. Dash® Original Blend, now the most popular salt-free blend in the seasoning category. (Taken from website.)
<p> Today, Mrs. Dash Seasoning Blends are available in 14 different varieties that add flavor to foods — everything from seafood to salad and meat to mixed vegetables.
<p> Whether you like onion and herb, chicken grilling, hamburger grilling, or even an Italian medley spice, Mrs. Dash has you covered.
<p> I was sent 5 bottles of salt free spices for review purposes. I received table blend, tomato basil garlic, Caribbean citrus, fiesta lime, and onion and herb.
<p> Get inspired by the real Island flavors of Mrs. Dash® Caribbean Citrus Seasoning Blend! This sweet yet savory, all-natural, salt-free mix of black and chili peppers, nutmeg, lime and orange adds a tropical twist to every meal. Amazing on chicken, pork, seafood or even fresh fruit.
<p> No salt por favor! Take your meals south of the border when you turn up the flavor with all-natural Mrs. Dash® Fiesta Lime Seasoning Blend. Made with black and chili peppers, garlic and lime, just a dash adds a zesty twist to your favorite chicken, tacos, fish, rice, and guacamole. Watch your meals go from mediocre to fantastic fiesta in no time at all.
<p> Ditch the salt and bring flavor back to the table with Mrs. Dash® Table Blend. Just a few shakes of its all-natural herbs and spices like onion and black pepper add a flavor that’s fit for any salt-free occasion.
<p> I like that I was sent such a different medley of spices. It's fun to try different spices on old favorites. Spice up that plain chicken with the zippy bold taste of Caribbean citrus! I didn't notice a real difference in the taste of the salt-free spices though. I do like the lack of sodium in my diet from them though!
<p> I used the Fiesta Lime seasoning on some grilled chicken that I browned up. It gave the chicken a nice burst of flavor that I really enjoyed. I usually just season my meat with seasoned salt and garlic powder, so this was a nice change from the usual. The taste of the spice was spicy but not anything that I couldn't handle. The lime kicked the spice up a notch and really gave the chicken some personality.
<p> The onion and herb was fantastic on a steak that I made for my boyfriend tonight. Onion and herb are two flavors which compliment each other so well and taste fantastic together. He said the spice combined with the juicy, flavorful meat was awesome. The onion did not overpower the herb flavor, but both flavors were balanced and easily recognizable. He said he isn't sure he can eat the steak without the seasoning now!
<p> I haven't gotten a chance to try the other spices, but I can't wait to use them in the near future on a dish that will really sparkle courtesy of Mrs. Dash!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking THREE (3) winners who will each win three varieties of Mrs. Dash's spices randomly chosen for them.2. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED! Please tell me why you would like to win these spices. (1 entry)
