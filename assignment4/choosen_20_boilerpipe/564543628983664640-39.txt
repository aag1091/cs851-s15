<p> It's not everyday that I cover important topics on my blog. Although giveaways and reviews are fun and exciting, it's always essential to post about important events that educate others. Clean water is something that I feel strongly about. I will help out whenever possible to ensure that others have the same clean water to drink as I do.
<p> World Water Day is today, March 22nd. This day hopes to raise awareness that over 4,000 children in developing countries die every day from illness and disease related to unsafe drinking water.
<p> What’s happening abroad?Every 20 seconds, a child dies as a result of the abysmal sanitation conditions endured by some 2.6 billion people globally. That adds up to an unconscionable 1.5 million young lives cut short due to poor water conditions.
<p> How can we help? Through organizations including the Children’s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) Program that provide a week’s worth of clean water to children in the developing world when you purchase a PUR water filter. Not to mention, you can also visit the PUR Facebook page and donate clean water for free through the Daily Drop program every day!
<p> What do we need to know about our families’ water? Your tap water may look clean, but it may still contain potentially harmful contaminants. Depending on where you live, your water can be contaminated with everything from industrial and agricultural pollutants to heavy metals, sediments and even trace levels of pharmaceuticals.
<p> Our ultimate in filtration Easy one-click installation Built-in electronic filter life indicator Provides up to 100 gallons Enjoy filtered or unfiltered water at the flip of a switch

<p> This is post #6 for Kiddie Academy. I had never thought about opening a franchise, but this is something that is working well for people, especially Bill and Marina!
<p> Bill and Marina Schmidt opened their Kiddie Academy franchise on March 31, 2008 at 4225 Concept Court, Bradenton, Florida, while in their mid-40's. The Schmidts have a passion for the business and believe whole-heartedly in “Community Begins Here.” With their dedication to superior customer service, commitment to education and focus on creating a warm, nurturing environment, the Schmidts have shown local families why Kiddie Academy stands apart from their competitors.
<p> Background: With the birth of their daughter, Bill and Marina began looking for quality child care in their area, which turned out to be quite a challenge. As a Vice President of Human Resources for a Fortune 500 company, with a Master’s degree in early childhood education, Marina became dissatisfied with the corporate world and saw this as an opportunity to use her skills in an educational aspect. For Bill, a manufacturing engineer, opening a Kiddie Academy location meant bringing a much needed service to the area. The Schmidts were looking at child care franchise options for a little over a year before they decided upon Kiddie Academy. They found Kiddie Academy’s dedication to education and warm, welcoming approach to be the perfect combination.
<p> Goals: Coming from the human resources field, having excellent customer service has always been a goal for Marina. Developing a staff that can provide the level of service the families deserve is important. They host new hire orientations, service trainings and monthly staff meetings, which include role playing. Both Marina and Bill continue to look for ways to go above and beyond for the families they serve, including help with resumes or locating jobs in the area.
<p> Challenges: Like many new business owners, the Schmidts faced challenges. At the time of their opening, the economic market conditions were the worst in many years. Homes throughout Florida and the rest of the country were being foreclosed on and unemployment rates were at an all-time high. Nevertheless, the Schmidts persevered -- benefiting from an abundant work force, the fact that many previous stay-at-home moms were re-entering the workforce, and a supportive franchisor with a proven business model. Despite those issues, the Schmidts have become extremely successful.
<p> Results: The couple’s passion and attention to customer service and community outreach has earned them a stellar reputation in the area, along with tremendous community and parent support. They have received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback that has complimented their passion, service and programs. The Schmidts focus on grassroots marketing and initiatives, including events such as book readings, parent date nights and local partnerships have helped them achieve the success they are enjoying today.
<p> *DISCLOSURE*I have a 3 month relationship with Kiddie Academy for which I am being compensated for. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine, and not based on anything else.

<p> This is the first guest post by Maire Hunter. If you'd like to write a guest post feature on my blog, just let me know!
<p> Quick tips for grocery shopping
<p> A trip to the grocery store can be daunting whether you have to fight crowds, avoid the temptation of cookies or stick to a limited budget. Remember the following tips to keep in-store hiccups to a minimum.
<p> 1. Be savvy
<p> What’s the average price on spaghetti? Do you know the best place to buy produce? Compare shops and keep track of retailers who offer the best deals. Join a store's rewards program for access to offers and specials you might not otherwise realize.
<p> 2. Keep a list handy
<p> If you run out of Parmesan cheese after tonight's dinner, will you remember to buy it next week? Even if you have a steel trap memory, a list on a whiteboard, envelope or grocery store app on your smartphone will help you remember exactly what you need without hesitation.
<p> 3. Go frozen
<p> Significantly add to storage time by buying frozen vegetables and other foods that can be stored longer than their fresh counterparts. While you'll want to have a nice mixture of fresh foods from which to choose, frozen can complement mealtime and is an economical choice.
<p> 4. Timing is everything
<p> Plan your trips to the store. Visit the grocery during off-peak hours to save time in line. If you need to visit two or three different stores to get everything on your list, go to each store when you're already on that side of town.
<p> These tips will ideally make things easier on you, even if going to the grocery store is your favorite activity. If you dread going to the store, being armed with coupons, lists and planning may just be your salvation.

<p> I try to make sure that my home is as organized as possible. It drives me insane to have clutter and mess everywhere. I much prefer when everything is put away in its proper place. I am always interested in any new home organization tools or items that will make my life easier. Rubbermaid does a great job of making that a reality for me.
<p> Rubbermaid is a leader in developing innovative, high-quality solutions that help consumers keep their homes in order. Widely recognized and trusted, Rubbermaid designs and markets a full range of home organization, storage and cleaning products to keep the home – including closets, garages, kitchens and outdoor spaces – neat and functional, freeing consumers to enjoy life.
<p> Rubbermaid has been a constant fixture in my life for years. I use their tupperware to store leftovers in the fridge, and I store clothes in their organization tubs when they are for a different season. Rubbermaid is always there to make life as worry-free as possible.
<p> When I was contacted to review Rubbermaid's new hidden recycler I jumped at the chance. This had my name written all over it. I used to keep my recycling under my sink in a container, but I never really liked that. Rubbermaid's hidden recycler is made for recycling and I can feel good knowing I'm storing items for recycling properly.
<p> The hidden recycler attaches to the inside of a cabinet door to collect recyclables out of sight and keeps your counters clear. The bag is durable, machine washable, and made of recycled material. Collect your recyclables and then easily lift the bag from the lid and cabinet by the handle to take them out to your recycle bin.
<p> ■ Hinged lid attaches to cabinet door with over the door hooks or screws■ Bag is made from 65% post-consumer resin■ Bag is machine washable■ Comfortable handle for transport■ 5 gallon bag holds 36 uncrushed cans and is large enough to fit 1 gallon milk jugs■ Great for single stream recyclers■ Great for apartment living
<p> The hidden reycler is not hard to install at all. After reading the clear instructions, I attached the recycler to the inside of my cabinet wall with ease. The cabinet door cleanly closes even with the recycler installed. Nobody will have to see your recycling and it will be hidden away discreetly. The bag holds a decent amount of recycling which is fantastic. If you throw away a drink bottle and there is a little bit that leaks inside the recycling bag, no worries! You can just take the recycling bag out of the unit and throw it in the washing machine.
<p> The one thing that I really like about the unit is that you don't have to empty the items from the unit into a bag to take to the trash. You can take the recycling bag out of the unit and take it to the trashcan and then re-attach it back to the unit. That's a really convenient feature.
<p> The reycling unit will definitely make my life easier and more organized, for that I am very grateful!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Rubbermaid hidden recycler.

<p> As you all might remember, I was chosen to be a Duane Reade blogger a few weeks ago. The opportunity is beyond exciting. Not only do I get to work with a great group of bloggers, I get to work with a fantastic company too!
<p> This morning, myself and a handful of others bloggers got together at the Duane Reade headquarters, to be familiarized with what is expected of us for the program. I hadn't met anyone previously, so it was great to put a face with a blog.
<p> Me at Duane Reade's headquarters office.
<p> After a yummy breakfast, we viewed slides of what's to come for Duane Reade's website, and what the goals and responsibilities of us will be for the next seven months.
<p> We then were shuttled over to 40 Wall Street which is home to a recently renovated Duane Reade. The store was absolutely gorgeous and did not feel like any old ordinary drug store. This branch had a hair salon, sushi bar, nail bar, and juice bar!
<p> This is a fantastic beauty tool that I think every Duane Reade should have. This machine takes your picture and then allows you to scan the barcode of makeup products and then puts them on your face. Let's say you like this eyeshadow but aren't sure how it will look on. Just scan the barcode and the eyeshadow instantly goes on your eyelids! The same thing for foundation, blush, etc. It's awesome and so helpful! You then can email the picture to yourself, and with the picture comes a list of each product that's on your face! That way you won't forget if you want to buy the items next time you go to Duane Reade. The virtual makeover station is also perfect if you want to switch up your look and try something new.
<p> This is the hair salon where you can get a hair cut, a blowout, or a shampoo.
<p> Yes, I would like one of each.
<p> A shot of just a portion of the cosmetics section.
<p> Step aside Jamba Juice!
<p> The sushi bar where sushi is made fresh daily.
<p> Manicures and gel wrap nails are offered here.
<p> A group shot of all of the Duane Reade Bloggers!
<p> I can't wait to get started to further connect with the bloggers and blog for Duane Reade. Thank you again to Duane Reade for choosing me. I know we will have a fun and beneficial partnership!

<p> Ellen Whitehurst is a Better Living Expert as well as the author of the bestselling book Make This Your Lucky Day. She is recognized as the country’s premier expert in Feng Shui and other empowering modalities such as holistic medicine, aromatherapy, and astrology. Ellen also pens a daily inspirational tip for iVillage.com currently reaching over a half million each day. She is also the newest Ultimate Health and Wellness expert contributing to DoctorOz.com.
<p> I first heard Ellen being interviewed on Bob and Sheri, a nationally syndicated morning radio show. She was speaking about astrology and I was truly fascinated. I've always been interested in astrology and learned a lot from her interview. I read her daily tips on iVillage and love the expert advice that she gives. If you haven't heard of Ellen previously, I urge you to check out her website. You'll learn a lot from her.
<p> I'd like to share some tips from Ellen that I feel are very worthwhile and important. The tips below are how to create a lucky life all year round.
<p> 1. Even if you’re traditionally not a morning person, there are some things that anyone can do to start the day off from a place of anticipation, expectation, gratitude and joy. The very first thing you see the very first time you open your eyes in the morning will influence and impact, not only that particular day but potentially your entire life. If the first thing you spy as you open your eyes is a desk full of unfinished business or exercise equipment with the dry cleaning hanging on it, or an open bottle of Vick’s NyQuil from the cold you had a week ago, well, imagine how these images impact your experience. On the other hand if you have a clean and clutter free sleeping space with a beautiful comforter keeping you cozy and warm and some images or artwork of beauty and possibly even some soft music playing in the background, well, then you might feel fully present as you express “Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.” Beginning your day in a state of present of gratitude also begins your day with grace. And don’t forget that ages-old legend and lore says that if you get out of bed by climbing over the foot of it, you’ll have outstanding luck all the day long.
<p> 2. Now, speaking of expectation, recent scientific research done on the difference between lucky and unlucky people shows that lucky people’s expectations, their dreams, goals, hopes and ambitions often become a reality because of one fundamental difference in how lucky people think. Simply put lucky people have positive expectations that then motivate them to take control of their lives. They will actually attempt to achieve whatever they want from life no matter the likelihood of being successful. This internal motivation prompts lucky people to persist even in the face of challenge, obstacle or adversity. Lucky people define at least five goals for themselves on a regular basis by writing them down and looking at them often. And, then, they take (at least) one proactive step each day towards reaching those same goals. They reach out or join in or even simply do a positive meditative visualization of what they will FEEL like when their goal is reached. Lucky people expect success. And, so, they often achieve it.
<p> 3. Invariably and, again, according to scientific studies, lucky people are found to follow their instincts, intuition and plain old gut hunches much, MUCH more than those who consider themselves to be unlucky. The lucky bunch do different things in order to enhance their intuition and hone their instincts such as investing time and energy in some formal form of meditation or simply sitting quietly and clearing their mind and focusing on the first thoughts that come to that same place after asking an appropriate question. Creating a sense of stillness in order to get in touch with intuitive inspiration is a hallmark of lucky people and can add immeasurably to a state of clarity and calm as well. Go ahead, ask any harried mom how lucky they are when they can find a personal peace as well as some clarity and calm. See? Lucky.
<p> These three tips are applicable to anyone at any time and in any place. Exercised with regularity and belief they can help anyone to create a luckier life filled with health, happiness, love and prosperity.
<p> All women have their staple beauty products in their makeup case and bathroom. I love having my go-to products handy, but I also enjoy trying new items to find new favorites. Since warmer weather is approaching, it's time to adjust your beauty routine for spring.
<p> Sue Devitt has created a beauty line which offers makeup and skin care products along with brushes and tools. Need a lipstick or eyeliner? You'll love the shades available. The eyeshadow and mascara offered will be right up your alley too. For whatever your beauty needs may be, Sue Devitt will keep you looking stylish and fabulous!
<p> I'm always on the hunt for something to keep my skin hydrated but give me some color too, since I have fair skin.
<p> Create a warm, glowing complexion with this fluid, tinted moisturizer that also boosts skin’s hydration in preparation for the summer.
<p> Sue Devitt's SpaComplexion Hydrating Marine Minerals Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 15 is the perfect pick to keep your skin hydrated and also gives you some color too. The best part is that it has SPF 15 in it so you'll be safe when you're having fun in the sun.
<p> I feel it's essential to always use a moisturizer in your beauty routine. Dry skin is not pleasant and should be avoided at all costs.
<p> What's your daily beauty routine?
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:
<p> 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a SpaComplexion Hydrating Marine Minerals Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 15 of their shade choice.
<p> Winner will be chosen on March 29, 2012 at 10 pm and then will be emailed. One entry per day.Alternate winner will be chosen if winner does not respond after 48 hours. Thank you and good luck!

<p> In my opinion, chocolate truly cures everything. The sweet, creamy treat can do no wrong in my eyes! There's nothing like a fantastic chocolate bar to satisfy that sweet tooth. I don't discriminate against chocolate. I enjoy it in brownies, cookies, pies and more. Maybe I'll even have a piece today! :)
<p> La Bella Gift Baskets offers beautiful gift baskets for practically any occasion. Treat your family to a gorgeous snack basket for Christmas. LaBella offers themed gift baskets along with baskets designed for men or women. Whatever your needs are, LaBella has the right basket just for you.
<p> LaBella's baskets are perfect for letting loved ones know that you're thinking of them. Surprise them with a candles gift basket or a meat and cheese one!
<p> I recently did a giveaway for LaBella, but I knew the baskets were too good to just do a giveaway. I had to do a review too!
<p> I browsed the baskets, my eyes growing larger with excitement each basket I saw. I finally settled on the large chocolate gift basket. This basket is what chocolate dreams are made of!
<p> The basket is beautiful. I know what you're asking though, you want to know what's inside, right? I'll tell you:
<p> The treats come packed into a nice basket that I could easily reuse after the yummies are gone. Obviously there is so much chocolate that I can't try everything at once. I have tried the chocolate brownies and the chocolate peanut butter delight. Once you take a bite of the brownie, you're on the fast track to chocolate town USA. The brownie is soft, moist and full of delicious chocolate flavor. It is firm, but chewy at the same time. It's not incredibly rich and sweet, but is sweet enough for me.
<p> The chocolate peanut butter delight was also excellent. I love chocolate combined with peanut butter, it's a delicious combination that you can't go wrong with. The peanut butter is creamy, and full of nutty flavor. The chocolate is sweet and delicious and lovingly wraps itself around the peanut butter for a fantastic treat.
<p> These two goodies are best served with a tall glass of ice cold milk. I can't wait to try the rest of the chocolate, I know I'll love everything.
<p> If you're looking to treat a friend or a relative to something decadent, this basket would be the perfect choice. Maybe they'll even share with you!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to LaBella Baskets for providing me with this complimentary chocolate basket in exchange for the review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I believe that humor is a necessary part of daily life. If there wasn't humor, life would truly be boring and mundane. It's important to not take yourself seriously and make sure that you laugh at the small things.
<p> You all might know Sarah Colonna as one of the writers and roundtable stars of Chelsea Lately, which is one of my favorite shows. Her witty, yet frank stories and skits are always entertaining, and she brings an added element of fun to the show. I've been a long time fan of hers and always enjoy seeing what hilarious thing she will do or say next!
<p> Sarah recently published a biography called Life As I Blow It. The hilarious memoir highlights growing up in the south (which I can relate to), moving to LA to pursue big dreams, her dating life, and trying to find normalcy while just wanting to have fun. The book has you sympathizing with Sarah when she breaks up with one of her boyfriends, and then simultaneously has you laughing while trying to get out of an awkward situation. The stories go in chronological order of her life and each one is funnier than the next. All of the content flows well together and is truly written from the heart.
<p> What Sarah does that sets her apart from other authors is that she doesn't attempt to sugarcoat her life. She can admit her regrets and what she is and isn't proud of, instead of hiding it. That to me makes a good writer that I can identify with.
<p> This book was a very quick read for me. I couldn't put it down and I finished it in only two days. I was actually annoyed when I finished it because I wanted more! Any book that makes me laugh ranks high on my list.
<p> If you're looking for a comedic book that will keep you entertained until the very last page, I highly recommend Life As You Blow It. You won't regret it!
<p> Sarah's currently on tour for her book. Click here to see if she's coming to a city near you.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking TWO (2) winners for this contest. Two winners will win a personalized (to them) signed copy of Life As I Blow It.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> Cuisinart has been one of my favorite cooking appliance brands for years. The products are quality made and yield wonderful results. Cuisinart's products cover the prep work for you. Why stand at the kitchen counter chopping carrots and celery when you don't have to? I've been needing to introduce a food processor into my life for quite some time. I'm happy to say the food processor and myself are now a match made in heaven!
<p> The prestigious Cuisinart brand is not limited to food processors. Plugged or unplugged, nobody covers the kitchen like Cuisinart. The company is a full-service culinary resource with a wide array of products, preferred by chefs and favored by consumers. Cuisinart offers kitchen appliances such as toasters, waffle makers, blenders, food choppers and food processors, deep fryers, coffee makers, microwaves, and much more. Cuisinart's beautiful range of products will keep your kitchen running properly.
<p> My favorite thing about Cuisinart products is how beautiful they are. The sleek, stainless steel exterior is gorgeous and very attractive. The appliances are built to last for years, which is an added bonus. I had reviewed a Cuisinart breadmaker a few months back and knew that I had to come back and review something else. Cuisinart is too good to ignore!
<p> I've been wanting a food processor for some time. This essential cooking tool makes prep work much easier and takes the hardwork out of cooking. When I contacted Cuisinart and they agreed to send me one, I was very excited! Images of julienned carrots and perfect thinly sliced cucumbers danced in my head.
<p> I received the Cuisinart Elite Collection 12 Cup Food Processor.I can't believe this beauty is mine!
<p> Product Specs:Offering home chefs with more options than ever, this next-generation food processor from Cuisinart is destined for culinary greatness. It comes fully equipped with two interchangeable bowls, plus an adjustable, 6-position slicing disc that ensures results exactly as you intended.
<p> Firstly, I love the design of the food processor. The sleek, chunky design with large push buttons is very modern! Not to mention that I love that it's silver and easily matches with my other small appliances. The device is large so I suggest that you have room for it before considering purchasing it. I have a small kitchen but luckily have just enough room for it. The unit came with a how-to DVD and a recipe book which was really helpful. The recipe book has a lot of great ideas in that I can't wait to start making like various dips and of course guacamole! The DVD does a great job of explaining how the device works and what you can get out of it. It's definitely a DVD you should watch if you aren't 100% sure of how to use a food processor.
<p> I love the various blades and slicing discs that are interchangable depending on what your food needs are. Be careful of the blades and discs though, they are very sharp. A food processor is perfect for making "restaurant style" vegetable presentations, if desired. It's easy to wow guests when Cuisinart does all of the hard work for you!
<p> I decided to start off small and make some thinly sliced carrots. The unit is very easy to put together and the instructions are clear. In no time I had the FP set up and running. It's not a very loud device either, which is great. You feed the peeled carrots through the feeding tube and instantly you have beautifully sliced carrots which will add pizazz to any salad.
<p> There's so many different uses for this food processor that it will surely revolutionize your kitchen and prep time. I know I can't wait to use it more. This necessary kitchen tool would be the perfect gift for a budding chef or that resident foodie that you know. Why not treat yourself too?
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Cuisinart for providing me with the complimentary food processor in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> Since I cook a lot, I'm always looking for more ways to give my food that extra boost of flavor. I love to cook delicious, flavorful meals. Sure, seasonings are nice, but if you over season the food it can turn out horrible. Having something that can give your food that extra pizazz without worry is great!
<p> Char Crust dry rub seasonings create a sizzling seared crust, bursting with juicy flavor. You can use Char Crust dry rub on any meat or fish, even vegetables.
<p> Can't you just imagine your favorite meals cooked with a fabulous, juicy crust? My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
<p> As you can see, there's a flavor for any one's taste. All American BBQ and original hickory grilled sound best to me. I regularly season my veggies with garlic powder, so I'd love to try the roasted garlic peppercorn. It sounds fantastic!
