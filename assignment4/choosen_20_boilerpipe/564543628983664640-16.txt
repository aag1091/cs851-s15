<p> There's nothing more satisfying and delicious than a wonderful piece of chocolate. The kind of chocolate that is sweet, luscious and rich. All of your other cares and worries in the world go away when you're enjoying chocolate as fine as this. That kind of chocolate is Romanicos.
<p> Romanicos Chocolate is your place to shop for gourmet chocolates and to find corporate gift solutions. We offer an extensive assortment of gourmet chocolate, chocolate bars, chocolate truffles and more. Romanicos is a sensual experience that begins when you see the beautiful presentation, then continues when you open the box and smell the delicious aroma of fresh chocolate. It finishes with the amazing texture and flavors that melt in your mouth.
<p> A box of chocolates from Romanicos would be any chocolate lovers dream. A box of truffles would make the perfect housewarming party or hostess gift too.
<p> Romanicos sent me quite the assortment of chocolate. Everyone knows I am a chocolate fanatic and this company must have sensed it too! :)
<p> I received a 36 piece mixed cube, and 3 large chocolate bars in the flavors of wild cherry, sea salt and soy beans, and walnuts and honey. I also received the same flavors in a mini sized bar.
<p> True chocoholics understand that one type of chocolate, one flavor, one tiny box, is never enough. We have taken our inspiration from these chocolate lovers and created this giant gift box of decadent chocolates containing our three lines of chocolate (Truffles, Chocolate Art, and our Truffle Bites).
<p> This is a perfect gift for those who don't want to choose between our delicious chocolates and want all three. This box brings together the best of our chocolates.
<p> When I saw the mixed cube I was in absolute heaven. I was looking at 36 pieces of the finest artisan chocolates and I loved what I was seeing. The chocolate art pieces were hand-crafted and each had a different pattern. They were truly a work of art. The chocolate was almost too gorgeous to eat, but hey who I was kidding? I couldn't resist trying some! The truffles and truffle bites were equally as beautiful and I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into them! I tried one truffle at first and it was absolute heaven. The chocolate was sweet, rich, and perfectly full of flavor. There was a slight crunch on the inside shell of the candy that was irresistibly delicious. It was very hard for me to not eat all of the truffles at once. I will soon try a piece of the chocolate art and the truffle bites. I am sure they will both be as equally delicious as the truffle was.
<p> The wild cherry candy bar was surprisingly great considering I am not a big fan of cherries in chocolate. I chilled the bar in the freezer before consuming and I am so glad I did. The dark chocolate was cool and refreshing. I loved the bitterness of the dark chocolate combined with the sweet, tart cherries. It was a unique and fun chocolate experience. The cherries and chocolate had a great balance. I could distinguish each flavor individually but together they complimented each other very well. This candy bar would be great for a late night snack paired with a steaming cup of coffee or a nice mug of chamomile tea.
<p> Next, I tried the soybeans and sea salt candy bar. I honestly did not like it. I don't like the speciality candies or candy bars with sea salt in them. The soy beans gave it a funny flavor in my opinion. I can appreciate the candy bar for what it is though and I'm sure other people would really enjoy it.
<p> I really loved the walnuts and honey chocolate bar, it was my favorite! I've never tasted such an interesting chocolate bar before. The combination of bitter dark chocolate, crunchy rustic walnuts, and sweet honey was amazing! The honey kicked the chocolate bar up a notch even though it was already sweet. It gave it that extra pizazz to set it apart from other chocolate bars. I can appreciate a unique candy bar and this was definitely up there! The walnuts were crunchy and spread evenly throughout the candy bar so each bite contained the right amount of honey and walnuts. This is a sweet treat that you must try, you will absolutely love it. I think this bar would be great if placed in the freezer for about 45 minutes or so. You'd have a crunchy, frozen treat that would be a great refreshing end of summer treat.

<p> Nothing beats a latte or a cappuccino. Sure a flavored cup of coffee is nice and enjoyable, but it pales in comparison to a rich and flavorful cappuccino. These are timeless and classic coffee drinks which have made their way into our hearts from decades past and are here to stay.
<p> Capresso is the mecca website of coffee machines for coffee lovers. Capresso offers espresso machines, coffee machines, coffee grinders and coffee beans, water kettles and frothers, and various parts and accessories for coffee machines. If you're in the market for a fantastic coffee machine that will create a delicious cup of coffee, look no further than Capresso.
<p> I was sent a gorgeous Capresso 4 cup espresso and coffee machine for review.
<p> Experience the full taste of espressos, cappuccinos and lattes! The Capresso 4-Cup Espresso &amp; Cappuccino Machine features an exclusive Coffee/Steam selector that makes it easy to control both brewing and steaming, allowing the user to adjust coffee strength to their personal taste.
<p> Features and Benefits•4-cup high-tech steam/boiler system •Boiler cap with built-in safety valve •Unique Coffee/Steam Selector allows you to move from coffee to steaming and to adjust coffee strength to your taste •Swivel frother with adjustable steam output allows you to steam large or small amounts of milk in seconds for frothing (Cappuccinos) and steaming (Lattes) •The powerful steam/boiler reduces warm-up time to under 2 minutes, producing 2 to 4 cappuccinos or lattes in under 5 minutes •Convenient filter holder with thumb guard for safe use •Illuminated on/off switch •Dishwasher safe glass carafe •Removable drip tray for easy clean-up
<p> How Things Work:The steam boiler principle of the Capresso 4 Cup Espresso &amp; Cappuccino Machine heats up water and then starts forcing the hot water through the filter holder and brewing espresso coffee into the glass carafe. During this time steam starts collecting in the boiler. When the coffee has reached the bottom line marking on the glass carafe, you can stop the brewing and switch to frothing milk. At that time the machine has created maximum amount of steam. When you finish frothing, turn the selector switch back to the coffee brewing position.
<p> Important: To avoid a burnt coffee taste, stop the brewing before all the hot water has passed through the filter holder.
<p> I've wanted an espresso and cappuccino maker for a long time. I did research on different machine brands for a while and discovered they had a feature that I didn't want or wished they had a feature that I wanted. When I came across the Capresso machine I knew it was the right one for me! Now I can have Starbucks in my own house! :)
<p> When I first received the machine it honestly was intimidating to me and I was not sure how to use it at all. I read the instruction manual on the website and it gave me a better sense of how to use the machine. I experimented with making a few drinks in the beginning which did not turn out well because I was still learning. I finally got the hang of how to properly use it and I made a delicious cappuccino if I do say so myself ;). I poured espresso in the bottom of my cup, added heated milk as the next layer, and the final layer was milk foam. It was fun to foam the milk myself, I enjoyed that. The coffee was delicious and had a fabulous velvety taste. I was so proud that I made the beverage myself! Oh, I wish I could have another cappuccino right now! I even put a tiny amount of chocolate shavings on top of the foamed milk just for that fancy final touch.
<p> Next, I would love to learn how to make foamed milk art like this:
<p> The machine would be great for parties because it can create 2 to 4 lattes or cappuccinos in under 5 minutes. Now your friends can have their own personal barista at their dispense! The glass carafe is dishwasher safe and the drip tray is removable to make clean-up a breeze. This machine would be a fantastic gift for any coffee lover. You will surely fill their hearts with cappuccino and latte love. :)

<p> Have you ever dreamed of having your favorite coffee at your dispense, but only wanted a small cup of it? If you make a whole pot of coffee for yourself, you may only want a small amount and then the rest gets cold. You will then waste the rest of the pot of coffee. It's also annoying to wait for the coffee to brew. Don't you wish you could have a delicious steaming cup of coffee instantly? Well, Keurig has come to your rescue with a single serve coffee machine!
<p> Keurig machines are all designed to quickly brew a single cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or other hot beverage. The grounds (or other brew material) are supplied in a prepared, single-serving unit, called a "K-Cup". Once the machine has warmed up, the user inserts a K-Cup into the machine, places a mug under the spout, and invokes the brew feature; within 20 to 60 seconds, the beverage is ready. By omitting the K-Cup, users can also dispense a mug of hot water, which can then be used for instant soup or other hot drinks not available in the K-Cup form.
<p> Keurig machines brew coffee or tea by piercing the foil seal on top of the plastic K-Cup with a spray nozzle, while simultaneously piercing the bottom of the K-cup with a discharge nozzle. Grounds contained inside the K-cup sit within a paper filter. A measured quantity of hot water is forced through the K-Cup, passing through the grounds and through the filter into the waiting cup or mug below. A brewing temperature of 192 degrees Fahrenheit (89 Celsius) is the default setting, with some models permitting users to reduce the temperature somewhat, per preference.
<p> I was sent a beautiful red Keurig Mini Plus for review. It came with a 12 pack sampler of assorted K-Cup coffees. This was great because it introduces you to the different coffee types that are available.
<p> This machine is FABULOUS and so very unique. I love the attractive and modern design of it, plus it looks great on my counter top. It doesn't take up too much room which is an immediate plus.
<p> I briefly read the manual which was very self-explanatory and easy to understand. I then made my first cup of hazelnut coffee. It came out perfectly! Rich, smooth, and brimming with delicious flavor. You simply fill the water reservoir on the top, lift the stainless steel handle and place the K-cup inside. Then you close the lid and wait for the coffee to be ready to brew. You'll know when it's ready because the brew button has a solid red light around it. The machine is very quiet too which is an added bonus. It brews your beverage virtually instantly. You can't get any quicker than 20-60 seconds for brewing. I love that there's no clean up with this machine. It's my favorite part! Once you've made your beverage, simply throw the K-Cup away.
<p> This machine would be excellent for parties or get-togethers because everyone can have a hot beverage of their choice. Not everyone wants a pot of regular coffee? No problem! Your friend can have a cup of cocoa, your brother can have a raspberry tea, and your mom can have a mug of hazelnut cream coffee in a matter of seconds. The beverages come out hot, fresh, and delicious each and every time. It's excellent and everyone will be happy with the drink of their choice! The Keurig would also be perfect for storing on your desk at work for having a cup of coffee any time you want.
<p> I love that there are over 200 different varieties of beverages to choose from: roasted coffee, flavored coffee, hot apple cider, decaf, caffeinated, etc. Not to mention a great assortment of teas and hot cocoas to choose from. You can also add ice to the teas for a cold refreshing drink any time of the day. There's a beverage that everyone will enjoy and love. You can buy K-Cups at any grocery store too, they are easy to find. This would make the perfect gift for any coffee lover. I know that this machine will be a hit at my next party!

<p> Ahhh, the dreaded scale. We all know it too well. Either it's our best friend or our worst enemy. There's no denying that many people fear the scale, certainly around holiday season. If you've decided that it's time for you to drop some weight, why not at least have something pretty to look at while you reach your goal weight?
<p> Conair is a developer, manufacturer and marketer of health and beauty products and kitchen and electronic appliances. Since its founding in 1959, the company has become a leading manufacturer of nationally branded personal and health care small appliances. Conair holds the number one position in the industry with hair dryers and curling irons. Other products also include grooming, health and wellness appliances.
<p> I didn't know that Conair produced scales until I was contacted to do this review. I did a little research and loved all of the features that the scales had! I was very excited to receive my scale.
<p> I received a Weight Watchers® by Conair Glass Body Analysis Scale for review.
<p> This scale is great! I prefer glass scales to regular material scales. Even though you have to clean the glass more, I just think it's much sleeker and modern. I love the stainless steel and black combination too. It doesn't take up too much room in my small bathroom which is nice. The scale came with included batteries which was convenient. The scale has a large glass surface to stand on so you know that you are receiving an accurate reading. The blue blacklight combined with the black LCD display makes reading your weight easy. I love digital readouts because there's no guessing your weight, you automatically can see it. Just tap the scale to activate it and wait for the zero's to appear. Once they do, stand back on the scale and wait for your weight to appear instantly. The buttons on the side of the scale are easy to set to yourself or another family member for the scale to remember who is who. I love that you can truly keep track of your health and your weight since the scale accurately displays your body fat, BMI, body water, and bone mass. The scale does not lie even though knowing all of this information could be either a scary or happy moment for you.
<p> This scale would be a perfect gift for someone who is on the path to weight loss or someone who is very into nutrition.
<p> If you just want a good old simple weight measurement, but with extraordinary style, this best-selling Weight Watchers scale is a great choice! The smooth scale has an easy-to-read 1.3” digital display with a “tap-on” scale activator. There is a high-strength tempered safety glass with decorative silk screen available in white, red, or blue. The scale is 11.8” X 12.6” and has a 400 lb. capacity. The scale runs on long-life AAA lithium batteries that are included and has a 10-year warranty.

<p> I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to food. I'm always up for trying foods that I've never tasted before, and finding new favorites. I really love experimenting with old favorite foods and putting a different spin or take on them. It's fun to spice up food.
<p> I haven't tried everything yet but I did try the Mediterranean couscous and 4 bean and barley salad. Two of my favorite food are orzo and edamame, so I was excited to try the bean salad. I liked that the salad had a lot of flavor and taste but was not overdone on the spices. I could lightly taste the sea salt and various spices but they were very subtle. The salad was very fresh and would be perfect to bring to a picnic and serve. It could also make for a nice lunch or snack. The corn and mixed beans had a nice flavor and the edamame had a nice crunchy texture which I enjoyed. I really loved how all of the ingredients came together well and had an awesome 3-dimensional flavor. The dressing was delicious and added a great finishing touch to a delicious and healthy side dish.
<p> The Mediterranean couscous is extremely healthy as well and has key nutritional ingredients in it. It was a little taste of Morocco! The couscous was soft and very fresh and combined nicely with the tomatoes, peppers, and onions. All of the flavors paired together extremely well but still stood out enough for you to find the balance between them. Peppers and onions are a classic combination and go together so well. The lemon and citrus vinaigrette was delicious and extremely fresh and flavorful. I liked how the citrus and lime flavors played off of each other.
<p> I hope to be able to try the other side dishes soon, I'm sure they will be just as delicious as what I've already enjoyed. :)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES: 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Sandridge backpack with a coffee mug, a Fresh Delicious coupon, and notepads inside.

<p> Since I'm from the south, you know I enjoy a juicy BBQ pulled pork sandwich or a nice rack of ribs from time to time. My boyfriend who is not from the south is totally envious of southern food and would love to indulge in BBQ everyday if given the chance. There's just something about that tangy, smoky, BBQ that is so comforting and satisfying. Thanks to Pig of the Month, you can indulge in restaurant quality BBQ from the comfort of your own home!
<p> Pig of the Month has done a fantastic job of recreating favorite barbecues from different regions. They've decided to make their own perfectly smoked barbecue ribs and lip-smacking sauces—and share the goodness with you! Pig of the Month offers ribs just the way all barbecue lovers want them: perfectly seasoned, tender-on-the-inside but crispy-on-the-outside, smoky, and mouthwatering—just tear-off-the-bones good barbecue. Our smoking technique is one that was perfected over many decades.
<p> This fabulous BBQ company offers pulled pork, desserts, BBQ feasts, a special BBQ deal of the month, baby back ribs, and more. This company is your go-to source for any of your BBQ needs, and they do it deliciously I might add.
<p> Last week I heard a knock at my door. I asked who it was and they replied "Fed-Ex." They really could have replied MOUTH-WATERING BBQ! I knew they held a box which contained fantastic BBQ and I signed for it as fast as I could. I received two racks of Key West style baby back ribs. The ribs came with a special Key West BBQ sauce. YUM! It felt like hours until dinner time rolled around and I could cook these delicious racks of heaven. Lo and behold, dinner time finally came and my stomach was ready to enjoy some fantastic eats. These ribs are infused with the fruits of Florida. They are rubbed with coriander, cumin, and a bit of coffee to get them headed in the right direction. They are then slathered in a sauce like no other you’ve tasted. The sauce consists of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, lemon, and lime to re-create the islands in your very own home. Doesn't that sound mouth-wateringly delicious and unique?
<p> As the BBQ cooked it smelled so delicious and I couldn't wait to eat! I could hardly wait until my ladybug kitchen timer dinged, signifying that I could open the oven door which held a small piece of heaven inside! Finally, it was time to eat! I served the BBQ with steamed broccoli and rolls. What a perfect combination, right?
<p> The BBQ was cooked perfectly! It had a great rustic, smoky smell that combined nicely with the other fruits and spices that it was prepared with. I poured a small amount of sauce on my plate to dip the meat in, and prepared to get my hands messy! The first bite was simply incredible and everything I could want in ribs. The meat was tender, fall off the bone, and so juicy and succulent. It was perfection at its finest. I couldn't believe that I wasn't in a restaurant, but sitting in my kitchen and enjoying such a fantastic meal! The flavor of the meat was out of this world. I've never tasted a BBQ sauce that had such a range of flavors as this one. I would never think to combine fruits into a BBQ sauce but all of the fruits and spices combined excellently together. The sauce has a small kick to it, but the spiciness adds another level of depth and personality. This was seriously the best rack of ribs I've ever tasted and I highly recommend them for your next party, event, or family dinner. How about a final summer BBQ too? Dig in and make your taste buds happy!
<p> One lucky winner will win a 4 sauce sampler package featuring:
<p> 1 bottle Get Lei’d Hawaiian BBQ Sauce
<p> 1 bottle Love Me Tender The King of Memphis BBQ Sauce
<p> 1 bottle Cattle King Texas Brisket &amp; BBQ Sauce
<p> 1 bottle Key West in a Bottle Citrus Grilling Sauce
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES: 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a 4 sauce sampler package from Pig of the Month BBQ.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me why you'd love to win these BBQ sauces. (1 entry)

<p> There's nothing like the scent of Gain laundry detergent. One sniff and you will be magically transformed onto a beautiful tropical island where you'll be sitting beach side with a butler to attend to your every need. Just kidding, but imagine if a smell can do that, what can Gain do to your clothes? :)
<p> Gain offers a variety of laundry care items including: laundry detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets. Gain recently introduced a dish washing liquid as well. There's even Gain with a Febreze scent! Over the past few years, Gain has included new scents in their products such as Spring Awakening, Outdoor Sunshine, Apple Mango Tango, Lavender and more. Every scent will leave your clothes smelling amazing!
<p> I was sent two Gain products for review. I received Gain lavender scented laundry detergent and Gain lavender scented fabric softener.
<p> I did laundry this weekend and used my new fabulously delicious smelling Gain products to make my clothes look and smell terrific. I love the packaging of both bottles, they just instantly make you happy and put you in a cheerful mood.
<p> From the second I unscrewed the laundry detergent cap, the lovely aroma of lavender wafted up and it smelled just amazing! The fabric softener also smelled just as good as the detergent. I poured both the softener and detergent into my washing machine and prepared to let my clothes get happy and enrobe themselves in the wonderful lavender scent.
<p> Once my clothes were done washing, I realized two things. The scent of the lavender actually stayed on my clothes! I've used yummy scented detergents before and the scent didn't transfer to my clothes which disappointed me. Secondly, the softener made my clothes soft and very easy to fold which was a big plus to me. The scent truly lasts too! I wore a shirt today that I washed on Saturday and when I went to put it on this morning, it still smelled like lavender! Wow! That put me in a good mood.
<p> I've been using Gain for years and I love how it's such a stand up product. I've never had any issues or complaints with the brand and I will continue to use them for years to come. Not only does Gain leave my clothes very clean, but also smelling awesome as well. Thanks Gain!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES; 1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a bottle of Gain lavender scented fabric softener and lavender scented laundry detergent.

<p> Are you tired of going for a run or exercising and your earbuds just do not stay in your ears? Picture it now, you're running in the park and you've got a great speed going but suddenly your earbuds fall out of your ears. What do you do? You have to stop or slow down and put them back in and that slows your exercise down. How annoying, right?
<p> Yurbuds are ultra-soft earbuds that won't fall out! They have a world-class patented design that complements the human ear while providing exceptional sound quality. I am picky when it comes to headphones. I don't like ones that go over your head as they sometimes get heavy and uncomfortable to wear. Regular earbuds don't always stay in even though they are comfortable to wear.
<p> I was sent a pair of Yurbuds for review. I received a red pair.
<p> These are the fanciest headphones I've ever owned or seen! They are a fun red color which I like. The earbuds are made of a jelly like material and they are extremely comfortable to wear in your ears. The material sort of "molds" to your ear, which is the secret to them staying in. I took these to the gym to use with my ipod. I went running on the treadmill and to my surprise they truly stayed in my ears! I don't mean they slightly fell out or become loose, but they 100% stayed in. I was very impressed! How did I live my life without Yurbuds before? I have no idea. The sound quality is perfect. The earbuds come with a storage case too which is convenient when not using them. Yurbuds would be the perfect gift for the athlete in your life, it will change their exercise experience like never before! It would also be a great gift for any music lover too.

<p> I like to get as many healthy cooking tips as possible. I try to cook healthy on a regular basis but sometimes it's not always possible. I had a great opportunity to ask my questions to a professional chef! I was excited at the opportunity.
<p> With back-to-school right around the corner, stress is added to already-packed schedules. For the busy season ahead, it’s even more important to make time for family dinners each night. Bob Evans can help you find a way to provide quick, convenient solutions so mom and dad don’t have to spend all evening in the kitchen.
<p> Yesterday, chef David Eisel who is the brains behind the Bob Evans Farm foods was available for live interviews. I wasn't available for a live phone interview but I was able to submit my questions in ahead of time.
<p> I asked the following questions: What are your suggestions for making a healthy recipe with not a lot of time? What fresh vegetables are key for optimal nutrition? What's a recipe you have for a delicious dessert that is low in fat and calories but big on taste? What are some good healthier ingredients to substitute in for unhealthier ingredients in recipes?
<p> These are the first questions that came to mind and I knew he would have no trouble answering them. I really enjoyed his answers to my questions and you can watch the whole interview here. It was fun to have the interview personalized to me. I hope you get inspired from it as well! :)
<p> Jewelry is something that I never leave home without. Everyday I wear earrings, rings, and sometimes a necklace or bracelet. I'm always on the lookout for new jewelry when I go shopping because I love to accessorize. My favorite type of jewelry is large, chunky, and dangly. I also enjoy unique pieces that you wouldn't see everyday.
<p> KT Collection is handmade jewelry made with sterling silver &amp; 14-karat gold filled chains. KT's Jewelry is inspired by her travel &amp; the NYC streets. I absolutely love her jewelry, it's so unique and fun and has a great element of style. I've never found a jewelry collection where I've liked so many of the pieces before. If you're looking for a necklace, earrings, or bracelet that is sure to please then you must browse KT Collection. Any of their jewelery would make a perfect gift for a friend or family member or even a bridesmaid!
<p> Here are a few of my favorite earrings:
<p> Aren't they just gorgeous?
