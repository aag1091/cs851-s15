<p> Showers are extremely relaxing. There's times that I just want to stay in there for hours. What's better than letting warm water beat down on you while you think about what you have to do for the day? Sometimes you don't want to stand though, it's much nicer to lay down and take a bath. If you don't want to take a bath, there's no other alternative for sitting down. The Butt Bench will change your shower experience from now on!
<p> The Butt Bench is a safe bathtub seat/storage bench that requires no installation. It simply attaches by suction cups to your shower walls. The bench is sturdy and made of natural wood. The tub seat supports your weight with no problem.
<p> I think the Butt Bench would be a great new addition to any shower! I chose white and it blends in well with the rest of my shower and looks great!
<p> The shower seat easily and securely attached to my shower walls with no issue. It fit in my shower perfectly and the length was just right. I used it for the first time today. It was nice to sit down while taking a shower and enjoy it. I deep conditioned my hair and sat down and waited the 5 minutes before rinsing it out. This was much easier, unlike before where I had to stand up and wait away from the water. It supported my weight with no problem and was still easily adhered to the shower walls when I sat on it.
<p> Why not turn your shower into a sauna and sit down and enjoy the steam and water? When you're not sitting on it, the shower seat also makes a great extra storage ledge to store shampoo, body wash, or other bath products on it. It's perfect for sitting down and shaving too. Ladies, you won't cut your legs anymore like you usually do when standing up! I think the shower bench is a great new addition to my shower and I can definitely see myself using it each time I shower!
<p> *The Butt Bench does not work in mobile homes or showers with glass sliding doors.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a Butt bench in their chosen size and color.

<p> When I have date nights with my boyfriend, we usually pick a local Thai or Chinese food spot. Asian cuisine is definitely a favorite food of mine. I think my absolute favorite dish is flat rice noodles with shrimp. I'm also a big fan of potstickers, orange chicken, sesame chicken and so much more. The flavor in Asian cooking is bold, delicious, and full of many spices and seasonings all at once. I truly love it!
<p> Day-Lee Foods is a leader in authentic Asian cuisine. They produce restaurant-quality frozen Asian dishes that marry authenticity with value and convenience. Their Crazy Cuizine lineup features everything from Potstickers to Mandarin Orange Chicken to Teriyaki and General Tso’s Chicken. You can feel good about enjoying these meals because they are made with authentic flavors from the Far East. The entrees are fully cooked (ready to heat and serve), high in protein, and free of preservatives, trans-fat and MSG. If you're a fan of Asian food, you'll go absolutely crazy for these entrees!
<p> I was sent four samples to try in honor of Chinese New Year, which is January 23rd. I received:
<p> Don't they all look wonderful? I think so too!
<p> I served the orange chicken and pot stickers tonight for dinner (I look forward to trying the other entrees soon!) Since the foods are already cooked, they go right from the microwave or stove top to your dinner table. I love easy to prepare meals on nights that I'm tired from working.
<p> The pot stickers were really great and large in size too! They had a nice chewy steamed outside and delicious pork filling inside. The pork was flavorful and hearty. They didn't taste like I just pulled them out of the freezer either! They tasted like they were ordered fresh at an Asian restaurant! The dipping sauce for them was flavorful and delicious too. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed them. They would make a great party or dinner party appetizer.
<p> Look how juicy this white meat was!
<p> The orange chicken was equally as delicious. It had that same fresh, restaurant quality, look and taste. The chicken had a glossy orange coating on it too. The boneless chicken was very juicy and full of flavor. It practically melted in your mouth. Some orange chicken that I've had was spicy, this wasn't, which I was glad for. The orange flavor was tangy and just fantastic. This honestly was the best orange chicken I've had in quite some time!
<p> I highly recommend Day-Lee Foods for your next family dinner. The foods are quality and delicious and I'm sure your family will gobble them right up!
<p> Crazy Cuizine free-product coupons can be used at BJ's Wholesale Club locations nationwide and select club stores across the country as well as at Albertsons, Ralphs, Food for Less, Raley's and Lucky Supermarkets throughout California and the Pacific Northwest.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win two free product coupons to purchase entrees from the Crazy Cuizine line from Day-Lee Foods.

<p> Valentine’s Day isn’t just about lavishing women with flowers and chocolate. You want to celebrate that special guy in your life as well. Many creative gift ideas can show your man how much you love him.
<p> Coupon Book
<p> Even if you don’t have the extra cash for an expensive gift, you can still give your guy something special. Make a coupon book full of creative coupons that he can redeem. The coupons can include a back massage, guys’ night out, homemade dinner, and date night. You won’t have to spend any money on this book, and the coupons will encourage romance and quality time together in the year to come.
<p> Sports Tickets
<p> If your guy is a sports nut, give him a pair of tickets to his favorite team’s game. Even if his sport isn’t in season right now, you can line up tickets to a big game next season. If you really want to splurge, you can buy a pair of season tickets, and the two of you can spend your weekends cheering on his team. Call the team’s ticket office; you can grab single-game tickets for under $100, while season tickets will likely run you a few hundred dollars.
<p> Experience Gift
<p> If your guy has everything he needs, treat him to an experience he won’t forget. Take him on a tour of a local brewery or winery. Get tickets to see his favorite band when they come to town. Check out a museum exhibit that intrigues him. An experience gift can create a lasting memory.
<p> Electronic Gadgets
<p> Electronic Gadgets satisfy every guy. Get your man a new smartphone through his mobile provider; these can cost you anywhere from $100 to $500. A more extravagant Valentine’s Day gift is the popular tablet, such as an iPad or Kindle Fire, which range from a couple hundred dollars to $600 or more. If your man is an avid reader, than an e-reader will certainly be appreciated. These items are a cheaper electronic option, with some costing under $100. All of these items are available through a number of online retailers.
<p> Vacation
<p> Add some romance and enjoy some quality time with your man by surprising him with a vacation. You can stay local and select a nearby spot for a weekend getaway at a bed and breakfast, or you can splurge on a trip to a ski resort or tropical destination. Talk to a local travel agent, or check out travel websites to plan your getaway. Prices can vary from several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on your destination.

<p> *DISCLOSURE* This is a sponsored post that I was compensated to write.
<p> Quality food is important to me, especially quality meat. I make dinners containing ground turkey at least twice a week. I always use the freshest and best testing ground turkey. It's important to me to have a brand that I can depend on for quality-made food. For that, I turn to Jennie-O.
<p> Jennie-O believes that eating well shouldn’t come at the cost of taste. They've had that philosophy since 1940. This company produces many products including sausage links, ground turkey, turkey burgers, deli meat, and more. The meats always taste great and work great with any recipe. I've been enjoying Jennie-O products for years.
<p> One thing that I really love about this company is that they know that certain people have food restrictions. They've developed a gluten free, extra lean, and sodium smart line. I like that they care about their consumers and take their ideas into consideration to keep them satisfied.
<p> My favorite way to use Jennie-O's ground turkey is to make turkey "meatballs" for spaghetti. They taste great, have wonderful flavor, and are much better for you than beef meatballs! You won't miss regular beef meatballs once you have turkey meaballs. What's your favorite way to use Jennie-O meat products?
<p> Another favorite of mine is making the turkey sausage patties for breakfast. They have 65% less fat than pork sausage which is huge! They have great flavor and pair perfectly with an egg-white omelette. I try to use turkey in place of pork or beef whenever I can.
<p> Pretty soon you'll have to figure out what you'll be making since three lucky winners will win a $10 Jennie-O gift certificate! Get those recipe books out to create something delicious for dinner tonight when you win!
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking THREE (3) winners for this contest. Three winners will win $10 gift certificate good towards Jennie-O foods.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me which Jennie-O product you like best. (1 entry)

<p> What comes to mind when you think of cupcakes? I'm assuming moderately sized yellow cupcakes with a nice layer of vanilla or chocolate icing on top. Am I right? That's what I used to think a cupcake was too, until I was introduced to Crumbs.
<p> Crumbs is not your average bake shop, oh no. They take cupcakes to the next level! Their sweet treats are LARGE and in charge and covered with amazing chocolate chips, candies, peanut butter, chocolate drizzle, coconut, and much more. The cupcakes are truly a work of art just as much as they satisfy a sweet tooth. Not to mention Crumbs also sells cookies, whoopie pies, brownies, and more! Crumbs currently has locations in VA, IL, CT, NY, DC, NJ. Locations in PA are opening soon. Stop by your local Crumbs today!
<p> Here's some examples of some of my favorite Crumbs cupcakes for your viewing pleasure:
<p> Crumbs recently opened close to where I work. It's delicious but dangerous, all at the same time. I'm a fan of Crumbs on Facebook so I can keep up with their sugary updates, and I am always temped to grab something yummy on my lunch break, especially when they post the cupcake of the week. It's sometimes hard to fight the Crumbs urge!
<p> Since I've been a long time lover of Crumbs, I wanted to know more and truly dig deeper into the confectionery treat. I had the chance to interview Mia Bauer, co-founder of Crumbs. She really gave great answers to my questions and gave me wonderful insight into what Crumbs as a company is all about.
<p> How was the concept for Crumbs developed?I did a lot of baking and I saw how happy it made people so when Jason and I started to talk about opening a business together, opening a bakery seemed like the perfect way to combine both skills and our passions. There was a whole feel and experience we wanted to achieve so it very much informed the kind of desserts I made and the look of our stores. We really wanted a neighborhood bakery reminiscent of our childhoods. We opened our first CRUMBS Bake Shop on the Upper West Side in 2003.
<p> What do you feel is something that people love most about Crumbs?When we opened our stores, cupcakes were vanilla, chocolate, lemon, or strawberry, maybe with sprinkles. We were really the first bakery to create cupcakes with cool fillings, frostings, and decorations that had never been done before. Vanilla Coconut was one of my first creations consisting of vanilla cake frosted with rich vanilla cream cheese frosting and topped with just the right amount of sweet shredded coconut. While we made a variety of baked goods, it was our cupcakes that sold out every day, so we decided to expand and continued to grow our cupcake selection. Our gourmet cupcakes have now become the industry standard.
<p> How are the flavor ideas created? Do you take flavor suggestions from fans?I am constantly testing out new flavors and drawing inspiration from my kids, employees and our loyal fans to develop new varieties. I spend a lot of my time baking on my own to try out new flavors, which are constantly being created. Luckily, I could snack on sweets all day, since part of my job is to taste every new flavor, and not just a bite!
<p> Do you think you'll expand and ever have international stores?Yes, we look forward to having 200 stores in operation by the end of 2014 and continuing to deliver a great customer experience and differentiate our baked goods selection. Maybe someday our neighborhood bakeries will even make their way overseas.
<p> How many cupcakes do you sell a month?About 1,000,000 a month.
<p> What's one way that you're constantly changing and evolving?We are constantly developing new flavors and baked desserts for Crumbs fans to enjoy. While we’re known for our cupcakes, people are discovering our delicious whoopee pies, brownies, and options for those with dietary restrictions such as nut and dairy free.
<p> Do you have any plans of opening any more stores in the NYC area?Yes, but no specific locations are confirmed to date. New York City was our first market and we hope to continue to support the local community there while reaching our goal of 200 stores.
<p> What is your best-selling cupcake?Red velvet.
<p> Are there surprises for Crumbs planned in 2012?We have a lot of new ideas and new concepts outside the cupcake world we are working on for 2012.
<p> *DISCLOSURE* A big thank you to Crumbs and Mia for this interview. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine, and all interview answers are courtesy of Mia.

<p> I'm truly obsessed with anything related to the kitchen or cooking. It's kind of sick, actually. Just this weekend I spent 40 minutes looking at different cookware and small appliances at Sur La Table. I had the same reaction as to someone buying new clothes. Don't get me wrong I love clothes shopping too! My boyfriend had very little patience towards the end, lol. My kitchen is a Sur La Table in training and I love to use different types of cookware when I make my favorite meals. There's nothing like a new cookie sheet when making your triple chocolate cookies. :)
<p> Bialetti is a well-known culinary brand. They produce cookware, espresso makers, milk frothers, coffee prep tools, replacement items for products and more. Bialetti is known for its wonderful customer service and products which are built to last.I have a set of red pots and pans that are about two years old. Since I used them practically every single day, they were starting to use their age and wear. I knew it was time to replace them with a new set. I wanted something that would withstand everyday use, and of course be non-stick. When I had the chance to review the new Bialetti 8-Piece Nano-Ceramic Nonstick Cookware Set, I was very excited. I also loved that it was red, just like my old set! What perfect timing. :)
<p> Add some eco-friendly culinary devices to your cooking artillery. PTFE- and PFOA-free, this nonstick nano-ceramic set is also ideal for healthy recipes. All you need are a couple drops of oil for an easy meal with easy cleanup.
<p> The pot and pan set looks wonderful in my kitchen! I love the vibrant red color. It adds such personality and an element of fun to my kitchen. I used one of the skillets tonight to cook up some ground chicken. I used very little oil on purpose to heat the chicken. I wanted to see how well the non-stick worked. My chicken didn't stick at all to the pan while cooking, and I of course loved that. The chicken cooked quickly and evenly and the Bialetti name held up through and through. The chicken cooked evenly and throughly, and very quickly I might out. A feature that I really like about this set is that it's oven safe. I sometimes use a skillet to finish cooking a thick steak in the oven. It's good to know that the skillet can withstand high temps. The skilet was easy to clean afterwards and there was no charring or defect on the bottom after using it.I am excited to have this new set in my kitchen and I can see many delicious meals being made with them. :)
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Bialetti for providing me with the complimentary cooking set in exchange for this review. All thoughts and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else. This set is made by Fabio Vivani for QVC

<p> I'm looking to gain more fans on my Facebook fan page. Just go to the contact me section in the middle of my blog and click on the Facebook link. That will bring you to my Facebook fan page for my blog. You can stay in the loop of everything that's going on there. Spread the word!
<p> How many times have you been outside in the cold and received a text message that you tried to answer while wearing gloves? It happens to me all the time. I receive a message and I try to answer and instead of "Hi, how are you?", it comes out as "hji, hyuw yuu?" Since that would clearly be ridiculous to send, I have to take my glove off to properly answer, and then my hand hits the frigid cold air and I grimace. It's a vicious cycle, but thankfully Isotoner has come to my rescue.
<p> Isotoner, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, is the world's largest marketer of umbrellas, gloves, rainwear, rubber overshoes, and other weather-related accessories.
<p> When I think of gloves, Isotoner is truly the first brand that comes to mind. I've had various Isotoner umbrellas over the years and they are fantastic too. All of Isotoner's products are quality made and created to last. I love their brand!
<p> An Isotoner product that I just found out about is their SmarTouch gloves. I wondered how I had never had them or heard about them before!
<p> These gloves are truly needed in my life. The gloves for men or women, are designed with Isotoner stretch fabrics for proper fingertip fit. The gloves use a conductive thread embroidered on the index fingers and thumbs that sends an electrical impulse to touchscreen devices. This allows uninterrupted typing and texting in the cold! Now you'll never worry about how you'll answer a friend or family member outside in the cold!
<p> The gloves are meant for any touchscreen smartphones, ATM's, GPS units, Mp3 players and more. (An example of someone wearing the Smartouch gloves while using an iPad.)
<p> The gloves fit me really well and truly like a glove! They seem almost made just for my hand. The gloves are very comfortable and have a nice non-slip grip woven-like design on the back. You won't be dropping your phone or iPod again! The blue and black colors are nice and go with winter nicely. The gloves are very warm inside and will keep my hands toasty when I'm outside. I used these gloves yesterday when I had to run an errand. Normally when I use gloves with my ipod I try and select a song or singer that I'd like to hear, but the one above or below it comes on instead. It's hard to control my iPod while wearing gloves. I get frustrated and have to take off my gloves and then my hand freezes which is annoying.
<p> I was able to select exactly what I wanted without fail. I really liked not having to take off my gloves and my favorite music played through my headphones! I was able to control the volume to the exact amount of loudness that I desired too. I am really impressed with these gloves and I know that my hands will able to stay warm when I'm outside and want to use my electronic devices. Thank you to Isotoner for keeping me frost-bite free outside! ;)
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a pair of women's SmarTouch Isotoner gloves.YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!
<p> 2. Please tell me which electronic device you'd like to use these gloves for. (1 entry)

<p> Lightbulbs are very important. I know we might not stop and think about their purpose often, but we should. Without lightbulbs we would not be able to get ready for work, cook dinner, take a shower, and much more! Lightbulbs are needed in our daily lives. 1000 Bulbs feels the same way about those funny-shaped bulbs.
<p> 1000 Bulbs is the mecca and headquarters of lightbulbs. They are known for being the #1 light bulb retailer online! Any type of lightbulb or lights that you need they provide it. Whether you need incandescent, Christmas lights, rope lights, compact flourescents, halogens, LED, and more, it's there! Electrical supplies and fixtures are also available for purchase.
<p> Each category is separately available for your and the prices are truly great. You'll be satisfied each time you visit 1000Bulbs!
<p> One lucky person will be able to win a set of 4 of the TruDim CFLs!
<p> TruDim compact fluorescent lamps dim like incandescent lamps from 100% all the way down to 2% with zero low end flicker! But unlike incandescent, TruDim lamps are long-lasting and energy efficient! Designed specifically for use with standard non-illuminated 600 Watt incandescent slide or rotary dimmer.
<p> The bulbs have a quick warm-up time and and a warm white colored light that matches traditional light bulbs.
<p> What makes these significant is that CFLs (the “curly q” bulbs) are not typically dimmable, and even if they are will only dim to about 20% before they start to flicker and go out. They also take a lot of time to warm up when you first flip the switch. If you have CFLs in your house, you’ve probably noticed this.
<p> GIVEAWAY RULES:1. I will be picking ONE (1) winner for this contest. One winner will win a set of 4 of the TruDim CFL lightbulbs.
<p> YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST or all other entries will be DELETED!

<p> I've been a long time fan of QVC. I always tune in to see the newest item or product that they're selling. The jewelry and cooking segments are a favorite of mine. You can't forget the household items or electronics! Those are equally as great. The beauty of QVC is that you don't even need to leave your house to order your favorite products.
<p> QVC is a multinational corporation specializing in televised home shopping. Founded in 1986 by Joseph Segel in West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania. QVC broadcasts in five countries as QVC US, QVC UK, QVC Germany, QVC Japan and – QVC Italy to 200 million households. The name is an acronym standing for Quality, Value, Convenience.
<p> Since I work full time, I'm often tired when I get home. The last thing that I want to do is prep a full meal AND cook it. When I received the chance to review the Genius Salad Chopper Six-Piece Food Preparation System, I practically jumped at the chance! It had my name written all over it.
<p> The Genius Salad Chopper makes it easy to grate, cut, or chop your way to culinary greatness. As an added bonus, store leftover veggies in the bottom bowl for a fresh, crunchy snack!
<p> I love salads, but I hate to make them. The thought of cutting up carrots and chopping up peppers doesn't thrill me to be quite honest. This system revolutionizes my prep work and makes life so much easier. The system is very easy to use. It comes with two interchangable metal "grates" that fits inside. One is smaller, and the other is larger. You can use either, depending on the size of the chopped food you desire. Two different types of mini graters are also included.
<p> I made a salad with diced chicken in it for dinner on Sunday. I wanted to test this sytem out. I peeled my cucumber and stuck the entire vegetable on top of the metal grate. You close the lid down on top of the cucumber (the top of the lid has squares which connect with the blade on the grate to chop the food) and the cucumber is instantly chopped into fine julienned pieces! I couldn't believe it. The cucumber pieces look like I chopped them, but I didn't.
<p> Once you chop the food it goes directly inside the bow. No transferring anything from a cutting board anymore and potentially dropping it on the floor. The system is easy to use and you can easily press the lid down to chop with ease. I finished off the rest of my salad by chopping apples and carrots. The only thing that the system didn't completely chop was a head of lettuce. I think it might have been too thick. Next time I will cut the lettuce in half and see if that makes a difference.
<p> Another great feature of this system is that you can store the remaning food inside the bowl that is connected to the system. If you have leftovers, you won't have to worry about transferring the food into a tupperware container to put into the fridge. You can put the entire bowl in the fridge and have it for later. This bowl would also be great for bringing over a salad or anything else in it to a party.
<p> Overall I think this system is fantastic. It will save you so much time in the kitchen and make your culinary life much easier! I highly recommend it for anyone who cooks a lot. They will absolutely love it.

<p> Like I've mentioned before, I hate winter. I'm not a fan of cold weather, and I certainly don't like not being able to stay outside for long periods of time. What I do like about winter is the fashion though. The gorgeous coats, the pretty scarves, the beautiful boots, and warm gloves. I love all winter fashion. Too bad I can't get used to the weather though, huh?

<p> I tried endlessly last night and this morning to upload a video review of the boots, it just wouldn't work. I really would have rather shared the video then a text review. I am working to try to fix the upload problem.
<p> I was sent an adorable pair of Payless boots called "Molly."
<p> I've been looking for a a cute and comfy pair of boots for a while now. New York City winters are tough and these are just the boots to brave the cold weather in. I definitely these these are it! The brown is a great neutral color for winter. I love that it goes with so much. The fake fur at the top is warm and also very soft too. The boots themselves fit me well and are very comfortable. A pair of skinny jeans would look great tucked into them when paired with a warm sweater. The boots themselves are constructed well. The soles look supportive and sturdy. I like the buckles that are on the side of the boots too. The stitching on the bottom near the sole is a nice touch too. I am looking forward to wearing these boots this winter. Thank you Payless!
<p> *DISCLOSURE* Thank you to Payless for providing me with a complimentary pair of boots in exchange for this review. All thoughs and opinions are strictly mine and not based on anything else.

<p> I'm one of the rare people who actually enjoys doing laundry. There's something soothing and relaxing about knowing that your clothes are getting washed and dried while you sit back and wait. If you have a product to make your clothes smell fantastic, that makes doing laundry even better!
<p> Purex and Jockey have teamed up and are offering you a 20% off coupon. We all know Purex from the fantastic laundry products that they offer, and of course Jockey makes work-out clothes and men and women's clothes available to you. The two brands that you love are offering you fantastic savings, you can't get much better than that!
<p> I was sent a great prize pack featuring a Jockey sports bra and a bottle of Purex crystals in the Tropical Splash scent. It's always great to have a sports bra to work out in, especially if you go running or walk on the treadmill. The sports bra is comfortable, supportive, and fits me well.
<p> There are some great features of the sports bra:■Moisture-wicking helps keep you cool and dry■Key pocket which is very convenient for working out anywhere■Reflective logo which is great for safety■Breathable mesh panels■Soft bottom band for comfortable support
<p> The Purex crystals are fantastic. I've reviewed them in the past and each scent is better than the last. Just pour a capful of the "magical" crystals into your load of laundry at the beginning of the cycle. When the cycle is complete, your laundry will smell Purex-irifc! One sniff of my clothes after they've been infused with the crystals and I'm whisked away to a tropical island! I've washed my sports bra quite a few times and it is still in perfect condition and looks brand new. The softener gets rid of any clothing odor without harming the clothes.
<p> You'll love that your laundry is fresh and clean with the power of Purex! I didn't realize that you shouldn't use fabric softeners, when you wash your gym clothes. I bet you didn't either. Regular liquid softener products use oils to soften clothing, and these oils can harm the moisture wicking ability of active wear This can be avoided when you use Purex. Just one more great reason to switch to this brand.
